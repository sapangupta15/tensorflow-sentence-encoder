     OVERVIEW  

Key Drivers of Financial Performance  

Operations  

 The key drivers of financial performance vary among our operations.  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services. Brokerage segment results are principally affected by:    

conditions in insurance markets, particularly fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies, 

success in attracting and keeping clients, 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, 

interest income on our investments, 

expense management, and 

employee retention.   

 Consulting. Consulting segment results are principally affected by:    

our clients' employment levels, which are driven mainly by economic conditions, 

governmental regulations affecting the health care market, employee benefit programs and our clients' respective industries, 

our success attracting and keeping clients, 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, 

expense management, and 

employee retention.   

 As more fully discussed below in "Key Recent Events," in December 2007, we announced that we had signed separate definitive agreements to sell our Combined Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Sterling Life Insurance Company ("Sterling") subsidiaries. The results of these operations, which were previously included in an Insurance Underwriting segment, have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. The results of these operations are affected by:    

consumer buying habits, which are influenced by economic conditions, 

competition with other underwriters, including competition based upon claims-paying ratings, 

our success selling new policies, selling existing policyholders more services, and having customers renew their policies, and 

our investment results.   

 We have ceased writing property and casualty insurance and have placed our remaining property and casualty operations in runoff. Results of these operations are affected primarily by claims management and reinsurance collectibility.  

26 

Liquidity  

 Liquidity is derived from cash flows from our businesses, excluding funds held on behalf of clients, and from financing. We use liquidity to:    

pay for capital expenditures, 

repay debt, 

fund acquisitions and pension obligations, 

repurchase shares, and 

pay dividends to our stockholders.   

 Because we are a holding company, our subsidiaries may not have available cash to pay us dividends; in the case of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, this ability is limited by regulatory and rating agency considerations. Our access to cash generated from operations outside the U.S. may be affected by tax considerations and by pension funding requirements in our international pension plans.  

Executive Summary of 2007 Financial Results  

 Below is a summary of our 2007 financial results. Refer to our detailed discussion below for further details.    

Our revenues from continuing operations increased $590 million or 9% overall (2% on an organic basis). More specifically: 

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue increased $431 million or 8% (3% on an organic basis), and 

Consulting revenue increased $70 million, driven primarily by changes in foreign exchange rates.       

We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses and unusual items.     

Expenses increased 4% in 2007 due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange and higher compensation costs, partially offset by pension savings, lower restructuring costs and savings related to our 2005 restructuring program. 

Income from continuing operations increased $225 million in 2007 to $672 million. Net income in 2007 was $864 million, an increase of 20% from $720 million in 2006. 

We announced that we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. We expect that both transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 2008. 

We substantially completed the restructuring plan that began in late 2005. Total expenses of $366 million were incurred, of which $41 million was incurred in 2007. We expect these efforts to reduce annual costs from our continuing operations by approximately $270 million in 2008. 

Beginning in the third quarter 2007, we began a global restructuring effort, intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth to better serve clients. As a result of this effort, we:   

incurred $46 million in 2007 for workforce reduction and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other associated costs, and    

27 

expect these efforts to reduce annual costs from our continuing operations by approximately $240 million by 2010.    

Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program in December 2007 to $4.6 billion. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $2,777 million remaining under the authorized share repurchase program.   

 In managing our cash and investments during the year, we:    

spent $751 million to repurchase 19.1 million of our outstanding shares, 

contributed $211 million in cash to our major defined benefit pension plans, and 

repaid $250 million of notes payable in January 2007.   

 In November 2007, we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. As a result of this redemption and earlier voluntary redemptions, we issued approximately 14 million shares of our common stock.  

 All of our financial information reflects the application of critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments, as discussed below under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."  

 These items are discussed further in the remainder of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.  

KEY RECENT EVENTS  

Sale of Businesses and Disposal of Operations  

 In December 2007, we announced that we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries. These two subsidiaries were previously included in an Insurance Underwriting segment. We expect that both transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 2008. In more detail:    

CICA is being sold to ACE Limited for cash consideration of $2.4 billion. Additionally, we expect a one-time dividend of $325 million from CICA before this transaction closes. 

Sterling is being sold to Munich Re Group for cash consideration of $352 million. 

The net assets of both subsidiaries were approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007.   

 These dispositions are subject to various closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We have included CICA and Sterling's operating results in discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

 Over the last three years, we have sold the following additional businesses that are also included in discontinued operations:    

Aon Warranty Group ("AWG") and its worldwide warranty and credit operations, which were previously included in the Insurance Underwriting segment, 

Construction Program Group ("CPG"), a managing general underwriter whose policies were underwritten by Aon's property and casualty operation, which was previously included in both the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Insurance Underwriting segments, 

our U.S. wholesale brokerage business, Swett & Crawford, and 

a small Australian brokerage unit.   

28 

 Results of the businesses included in discontinued operations are as follows:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 In 2007, we sold the following businesses that remain in our continuing operating results:    

Media Professionals, Inc. and two other, smaller operations, which were included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. We recognized total pretax gains of $32 million on these sales. 

25% of our Botswana subsidiary, which is included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. A pretax gain of $4 million was recognized on the sale.   

 See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "Disposal of Operations," for further information.  

Restructuring Initiatives  

2007 Restructuring Plan  

 In 2007, we:    

announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce expense growth to better serve clients. 

estimate this restructuring plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately $360 million. Expenses will include workforce reduction and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, and other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative. We recorded approximately $46 million of restructuring and related expenses through December 31, 2007, and expect the remaining restructuring and related expenses to affect continuing operations through the end of 2009. 

anticipate that these initiatives will lead to annualized cost-savings of approximately $50-$70 million in 2008, $175-$200 million in 2009, and $240 million of annualized savings by 2010. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve the targeted savings.   

 The 2007 Restructuring Plan eliminates an estimated 2,700 jobs beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing into 2009. We also expect to close or consolidate several offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. These efforts will also trigger asset impairments in the form of accelerated amortization of any remaining leasehold improvements.  

29 

 The following table summarizes 2007 restructuring and related expenses by type incurred, and estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and approved include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying our sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in our overall analysis that might cause us to add or cancel component initiatives.  

 Workforce reductions reflect a cash expense, though we may recognize the expense before paying for the expenditure. Asset impairments are non-cash expenses. Lease consolidation accruals reflect the present value of future cash flows. Other costs are cash expenses, which are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  

 The following table summarizes actual restructuring and related expenses incurred, and estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative, by segment.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2005 Restructuring Plan  

 In 2005, we commenced a restructuring to reduce our fixed cost base and increase efficiency. This three-year plan is substantially complete, and resulted in cumulative pretax expenses totaling $366 million. Restructuring costs include workforce reductions, lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other expenses. For 2007, the estimated restructuring benefits were approximately $225 million. We expect these initiatives will lead to annualized cost savings of approximately $270 million in 2008. This estimate does not include any benefits related to businesses placed into discontinued operations.  

 We estimate this initiative will eliminate 3,600 positions, of which over 3,500 of these eliminations had already occurred by December 31, 2007.  

30 

 The following table details the restructuring and related expenses incurred by type.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The following is a summary of actual restructuring and related costs incurred, by segment.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Redemption of Senior Convertible Debentures  

 In November 2007, we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. All of the holders of the Debentures elected to convert their debentures into our common stock at a conversion rate of 46.5658 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures. As a result of this redemption and earlier voluntary redemptions, approximately 14 million shares of our common stock were issued.  

Distributions from PEPS I  

 We received income distributions from our preferred investment in Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC ("PEPS I") of $61 million during 2007, which are included in investment income:    

Prior to 2007, income distributions received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on various PEPS I debt instruments. 

Beginning in 2007, PEPS I had redeemed or collateralized all of its debt, and as a result, began to pay preferred income distributions.   

 Whether we receive additional preferred returns depends on the performance of the limited partnership (LP) interests underlying PEPS I, which we expect will vary from period to period. We do not control the timing of the distributions.  

Stock Repurchase Program  

 In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Aon's common stock. In November 2006, the Board increased that amount to $2 billion. In December 2007, the Board increased the authorization amount to $4.6 billion, designating that the proceeds from the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries be used to repurchase shares. We may repurchase shares using available capital through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions. We anticipate that the volume of share repurchases will  

31 

increase substantially after we receive the proceeds from the sales of CICA and Sterling. Any repurchased shares will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2007, we repurchased 19.1 million shares at a cost of $751 million. Since the program began, we have repurchased 48.1 million shares at a cost of $1,823 million. Of the shares repurchased since the program's inception, we have reissued approximately 13.8 million shares for stock options, stock awards, and other benefit plans.  

Tender Offer  

 Based upon a review of option grant practices in early 2007 by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, we determined that certain stock options were granted at a discount from fair market value and therefore are subject to adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  

 The Company issued a Tender Offer Statement in 2007 to permit our eligible employees to amend certain options (the "Eligible Options") that were granted by Aon under our Stock Incentive Plan ("Plan"). The Eligible Options include only those stock options granted by Aon: (i) that were granted under the Plan; (ii) that had an exercise price per share that was less than the fair market value per share of our common stock underlying the options on the options' measurement dates for accounting purposes (the "deemed grant date"); (iii) that were unvested as of December 31, 2004; (iv) that were outstanding as of the last date on which the Offer remained open for acceptance and (v) that were held by individuals who were subject to taxation in the United States. Current and former directors and executive officers of Aon were not eligible employees.  

 Eligible employees could elect to: (i) amend all (but not a portion) of their Eligible Options to increase the exercise price per share to be equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the deemed grant date (the "Amended Exercise Price"); and (ii) for each amended Eligible Option, receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the Amended Exercise Price and the original exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unexercised option.  

 The cash payments were paid on the first regular payroll date in January 2008. We also paid penalties, excise and other taxes of $7 million.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Aon's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect:    

what we report as our assets and liabilities, 

what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and 

the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.   

 In accordance with our policies, we:    

regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning pensions, contingencies, policy liabilities, investments, intangible assets, share-based payments and income taxes. 

base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances.   

32 

 The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates.  

 We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements.  

Restructuring  

 Restructuring costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with FASB Statement No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits and FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 applies to one-time workforce reduction benefits and requires companies to use Statement No. 112 when severance is paid under an ongoing severance policy. Lease consolidation costs, asset impairments and other costs associated with restructuring are accounted for under Statement No. 146 and FASB Statement No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  

Workforce reduction costs  

 We account for workforce reduction costs that result from an ongoing severance plan under Statement No. 112. Such instances occur when (1) we have an established severance policy, (2) statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or (3) we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula.  

 We estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we:    

identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, 

notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and 

expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period.   

 When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.  

Lease consolidation costs  

 Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, we make assumptions about the time period over which the building will remain vacant and the sublease terms.  

 We estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes.  

Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and sublease losses  

 Accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount back sublease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value.  

 Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. However, we discount the severance arrangement when we terminate an employee who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. Accretion of the discount occurs over the remaining life of the liability.  

33 

 For the remaining lease term or severance payout, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability.  

Other associated costs of exit and disposal activities  

 We recognize other restructuring costs as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.  

 Asset impairments may result from large-scale restructurings and we account for these impairments in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments in accordance with Statement No. 144 by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life.  

Pensions  

 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Canada.  

Significant changes to pension plans  

 Our U.S. pension plans are closed to new entrants, and effective January 1, 2007, we began determining future pension benefits using a "career average pay" formula rather than the prior "final average pay" formula.  

 Our U.K. pension plans have been closed to new entrants since 1999. On March 31, 2007 future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in the U.K. plans. Future retirement benefits are now provided in a defined contribution segment of a pension scheme.  

Market-related value of assets  

 The U.S. pension plans use the market-related value of assets to determine expected return on assets.  

 As of year-end 2007:    

the market-related value of pension assets does not yet reflect accumulated asset gains of $6 million. These gains will decrease pension expense as they are graded into the market-related asset value and may be offset by future asset losses. We recognize 20% of the asset gain or loss in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. 

we reported a fair value of pension assets of $1,514 million, while market-related value of assets is $1,508 million.   

 The U.K., Dutch and Canadian plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.  

Recognition of gains and losses and prior service  

 In accordance with FASB Statement No. 87, we defer recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and asset performance.  

 Unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees in the U.S., Dutch and Canadian plans, or the average life expectancy of the U.K. plan members. We amortize prior service costs or credits which  

34 

arise as a result of plan changes over a period based on the average expected future service of active employees in the plans at the time the prior service costs or credits were established.  

 As of December 31, 2007, the pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements. We amortize the actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation ("PBO"). To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.  

 The following table discloses our combined experience loss, prior service costs or credits, the number of years that we are amortizing the experience loss over, and the estimated 2008 amortization by each plan:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation  

 The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 We base our U.S. expected long-term return on capital market expectations for various asset classes. U.S. equities and fixed income expectations are estimated using a theoretical Capital Asset Pricing ("CAP") Model. The CAP Model for equities included three factors:    

Current dividend yield (1.7%) 

Corporate earnings nominal growth (6.7%) 

P/E ratio repricing (0.0%).   

 A fixed income expectation factor of 5.6% included the then-current 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yields and simulations of future yields based on expected inflation and other factors. We based:    

other asset class expectations on risk premiums relative to U.S. equities and fixed income expected returns, and 

estimates of volatilities and correlations among asset classes on historical data.   

 The actual allocation at December 31, 2007 was 76% equities and 24% fixed income securities.  

 In determining the expected rate of return for our U.K., Dutch and Canadian plans, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. We:    

consider historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and   

35 

weight the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.   

 Generally, the U.K. plans' trustees determine the investment policy for each plan. Because there are eight pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation represents a weighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change.  

 In total, at the end of the 2007 valuation year, the U.K. plans were invested 66% in equities and 34% in fixed income securities. The Dutch plan was invested 38% in equities and 62% in fixed income securities. The Canadian plan was invested 65% in equities and 35% in fixed income securities.  

Impact of changing economic assumptions  

 Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.  

 The following table reflects, holding all other assumptions constant, what a one percentage point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated 2008 pension expense.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The following table reflects, holding other assumptions constant, what a one percentage point increase and decrease in our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2008 pension expense.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Estimated future contributions  

 In the U.S., we anticipate minimum cash funding requirements of $8 million and $9 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively.  

 The closure of the U.K. schemes to future accrual and the renegotiation of cash contributions from the Company during 2007 both impacted recent and expected future cash requirements to the U.K. plans. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate U.K. funding requirements of $143 million in 2008 and $146 million in 2009. These contributions reflect minimum funding requirements plus other amounts agreed with U.K. plan trustees.  

 Contributions to the Dutch and Canadian plans are estimated to be $28 million and $16 million in 2008, respectively.  

36 

     Contingencies  

 We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.  

 We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlement strategy.  

Policy Liabilities  

 We collect premiums from policyholders, and we establish liabilities (reserves) to pay benefits to policyholders. The liabilities for policy benefits, claims, and unearned premiums represent our best estimates of what we expect to pay to policyholders in the future. If these liabilities prove inadequate, we would be required to increase the reserves, which could hurt our results and financial condition.  

Property & Casualty  

 Loss reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Because setting loss reserve levels is inherently uncertain, we cannot guarantee that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Loss reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, given our informed judgments based on:    

currently available data, 

future trends in claims severity and frequency, 

judicial theories of liability, and 

other factors.   

 Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance, and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments, and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting the claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before we can definitively determine liability. We periodically refine our reserve estimates as further losses are reported and settled and we continue to refine our experience and reflect adjustments to reserves in the results of the periods during which such estimates are changed.  

 We estimate loss reserves for all property and casualty lines of business by accident year using several standard actuarial techniques, which include, but are not limited to incurred and paid loss development methods, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, and frequency/severity methods. We project ultimate losses on a direct, assumed, ceded and net basis, and deduct paid losses from the selected ultimate losses to arrive at the total indicated reserve. The total indicated reserve includes case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves.  

 Our loss reserve estimates are influenced by factors such as the consistency of the results from actuarial techniques and our knowledge of emerging loss trends and rate or benefit changes.  

37 

Accident & Health and Life  

 To establish policy liabilities, we develop estimates of reported and anticipated claims, based on our historical experience, other actuarial data, and assumptions on investment yields. The actuarial data reflects our best estimates of future expectations regarding claim frequency, claim severity, and the length of time that a customer is insured. Morbidity and mortality patterns may change over time due to many factors including improvements in the general health of the insured population, changes in lifestyle, advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, or the occurrence of a widespread pandemic.  

 Although mortality, morbidity, persistency, and interest rate assumptions are set when we issue new insurance policies, we may need to provide for additional losses on a product by increasing reserves, reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product, or establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience or assumptions.  

 Liabilities for incurred but unpaid claims include estimated costs relating to reported claims, and incurred, but not reported, claims. We base the liability for unpaid claims on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims using best estimates from past experience. These estimates incorporate current trends and any other factors that influence historical data. Actual experience, however, may vary from our estimates, due to changes in claim reporting, processing patterns, and variations from historic averages for the amount paid per claim. Variations from historic patterns and averages could result in additional changes that increase or decrease unpaid claim liabilities.  

 We generally accrue a liability for future policy benefits relating to long-duration contracts when we recognize premium revenue. The liability represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders less the present value of future premiums. We estimate this liability using methods that include estimates of expected investment yields, mortality, morbidity, and policy persistency.  

 Actual experience may vary from our estimates due to emerging trends in morbidity, mortality, persistency, and asset yields  and some of these trends can fluctuate significantly over time. As we realize the actual experience, we take into account the financial impacts of these variations from our original assumptions. When current estimates of the present value of future benefits and expenses exceed the present value of future premiums for a product line, we recognize all excess amounts as a loss.  

Valuation of Investments  

 We periodically review securities with unrealized losses and evaluate them for other-than-temporary impairment. We analyze various risk factors and determine if any specific asset impairment exists. If there is a specific asset impairment, we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value.  

 We review invested assets with unrealized losses separated into two categories:    

1.Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events. 

2.Assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events.   

Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events  

 At least quarterly, we review the following types of information:    

the creditworthiness of corporate obligors for changes in ratings and financial performance, 

cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral for asset-backed securities, and 

issuer financial trends and market expectations based on third-party analytical reports.   

38 

 We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss when appropriate for these investments with continuous unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events. We base our decision on the facts and circumstances for each investment.  

Assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events  

 Invested assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events include those affected by:    

increasing U.S. Treasury or local sovereign interest rates, 

corporate and asset-backed credit spread widening, 

common stock price volatility due to conditions in the overall market or a particular industry, and 

illiquid market conditions.   

 In certain circumstances, we assume that a decline in value below cost is temporary for fixed-maturity investments, with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events from which the market is expected to recover; in these cases, we can hold the investment until maturity or the market recovers, which is a decisive factor when considering an impairment loss. If we decide that holding the investment to maturity is no longer appropriate, we will reevaluate that investment for other-than-temporary impairment.  

 We evaluate other-than-temporary impairment for preferred and common stock and other investments with continuous unrealized losses for two consecutive quarters due to market conditions or industry-related events. We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment loss based upon each investment's facts and circumstances and monitor these securities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses are not the result of issuer-specific events.  

 Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about our investments.  

Intangible Assets  

 Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. We classify our intangible assets as either goodwill, client lists, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles.  

 Although goodwill is not amortized, we test it for impairment at least annually. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we complete further analysis to determine whether there was an impairment loss. No further analysis was required in 2007 or 2006. We determine fair value based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results.  

Share-based Payments  

 Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest during that period. Thus, we have reduced expense for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. When the terms of an award require no additional service, the award is fully expensed at the grant date. When awards are modified,  

39 

we account for the incremental shares at the fair market value at the date of modification. Expense recognition begins on the date the service period begins, which can precede or be after the grant date, depending on the provisions of the award.  

Option Accounting  

 Before 2006, Aon was subject to Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Under APB No. 25, we recognized no compensation expense for stock options when the exercise price of the options equaled the market price of the stock at the date of grant.  

 In 2006, we adopted Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payments, and changed our method of valuation for stock options granted. Beginning in 2006, we moved to a lattice-binomial option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which we previously used for our required pro forma information. Lattice-based option valuation models:    

use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options. 

estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of Aon's stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Aon's stock.   

 Furthermore, we:    

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model, differentiating between executives and key employees. 

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate. 

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   

 The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.  

Service-Based RSU Awards  

 Before 2006, restricted stock units ("RSUs") granted to employees were generally service-based and accounted for by expensing the total award value over the service period. We calculated the total award value by multiplying the total number of shares to be delivered by the quoted market value on the date of grant. In connection with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R) in 2006, we began to estimate forfeitures and considered dividend discounts when determining the fair value of the RSUs.  

Performance-Based Awards  

 Beginning in 2006, executives and key employees may receive performance-based awards, which ultimately result in the receipt of RSUs, if the employee achieves his or her objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. The RSUs may be immediately vested or have a future additional service period. Generally, our performance awards are fixed, which means we determine the fair value of the award at the grant date, and recognize the expense over the performance or vesting period, whichever is longer.  

To expense performance-based awards, we:    

estimate the number of shares to be delivered at the end of the performance period multiplied by the fair value of those shares. 

recognize the resulting value by multiplying the fair value to be delivered times the percentage of the performance period completed.   

40 

 These estimates take into account performance to date as well as the assessment of future performance. These assessments are made by management using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the expense recognized.  

 The largest performance-based stock plan is the Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP"). The LPP currently has two performance periods  2006 to 2008 and 2007 to 2009. A 10% upward or downward adjustment in our estimated performance targets would increase or decrease total expense by approximately $8 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.  

Income Taxes  

 We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as well as U.S. federal and state tax laws.  

 The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, and are based on management's:    

assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and 

judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of Statement No. 109.   

 We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a "more likely than not" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations because they are considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according to the Internal Revenue Code.  

 We base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those which deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.  

 We operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. While historically we have not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns, there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:    

During recent years, the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue. 

To deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities. 

We may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed, and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance.   

41 

Tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes.   

 In first quarter 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which are recognized in a company's financial statements in accordance with Statement No. 109, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a company's tax return. As a result of our adoption of FIN 48, we did not record any adjustments to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  

REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

General  

 In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information.  

 We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items.  

 Supplemental organic revenue growth information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our consolidated statements of income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.  

 Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, we have:    

isolated the impact of the change in currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue, and have disclosed the impact on expenses and earnings per share, and 

provided this form of reporting to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations.   

 Some tables in the segment discussions reconcile organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the segments and subsegments. We disclose separately:    

the impact of foreign currency, and 

the impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and transfers of business units, which represent the most significant reconciling items.   

 In an "all other" category, we total other reconciling items that are not generally significant individually or in the aggregate. If there is a significant individual reconciling item within the "all other" category, we provide additional disclosure in a note.  

42 

Summary of Results for 2005 through 2007  

 The consolidated results of continuing operations follow:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Consolidated Results for 2007 Compared to 2006  

Revenue  

 During 2007, compared to the prior year:    

Commissions, fees and other increased $510 million or 8% driven primarily by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and organic revenue growth of 2%. 

Investment income increased $80 million or 36%. The increase was driven by: 

non-liquidating distributions from our PEPS I investment of $61 million, 

$14 million of realized losses on our Endurance warrants in 2006, 

realized gains from the sale of investments, and 

higher interest rates on our investment portfolio.    

 These increases were partially offset by a $35 million gain recognized in 2006 in connection with the contribution of our preferred stock investment in Scandent, received from the sale of our Cambridge operation, to a U.K. pension plan.  

43 

      Consolidated revenue by geographic area follows:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 We attribute revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues.    

U.S. revenue increased $66 million or 2%, reflecting growth in our retail business and affinity operations, partially offset by soft market conditions in reinsurance and investment gains being impacted by last year's gain on the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock. 

Americas other than U.S. revenue increased $86 million or 12%, due to strong growth in Latin America and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 

United Kingdom revenue increased $133 million or 11% driven by favorable foreign exchange, the impact of acquisitions, higher investment income and a gain on the sale of a book of business. 

Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased $240 million or 15% as a result of favorable foreign exchange, higher investment income, acquisitions and organic revenue growth, most notably in France, Italy, Spain, Africa and the Middle East. 

Asia Pacific revenue increased $65 million to $626 million, driven by favorable foreign exchange and organic revenue growth in most countries in Asia, which more than offset softness in Australia and the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan.   

Expenses  

 The increase in total expenses of $229 million or 4% from 2006 is driven by:    

$163 million or 4% increase in compensation and benefits, reflecting $189 million of unfavorable foreign exchange as well as higher salary and incentive costs, which more than offset significant pension savings, lower restructuring costs and the benefits of the 2005 restructuring program. Reduced pension expense was due primarily to plan amendments in the U.S. and U.K. 

$89 million or 5% increase in other general expenses, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, the gain on the 2006 sale of our building in Spain, the impact of acquisitions and the settlement of litigation in early 2007 for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business. These items more than offset a 2006 property and casualty reserve increase and 2007 gains from the sale of businesses. 

$9 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher interest rates and foreign exchange translation.   

 These increases in expenses were partially offset by a $30 million decrease in depreciation and amortization due to lower write-offs and a lower depreciable base than the prior year.  

44 

Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Tax and Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle  

 Income from continuing operations was $1,024 million, a 54% increase from $663 million in 2006. The increase was driven by improved profitability in our brokerage and consulting segments, distributions from our PEPS I investment, and an increase in our property and casualty reserves in 2006.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 34.4% in 2007 and 32.6% in 2006.  

 Differences between the overall effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are typically due to U.S. state income taxes and differences between U.S. and international tax rates. Changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income directly affect our effective tax rates. In 2007 and 2006, our effective tax rate also reflects the favorable resolution of tax examination issues, adjustments, and tax credits. In addition, our 2007 rate was impacted by changes in corporate tax rates in certain foreign countries, most notably in the United Kingdom, which reduced the enacted corporate tax rate from 30% to 28%. While the lower U.K. tax rate will benefit Aon's recurring effective tax rate in future periods, we had to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax assets using the new enacted tax rate, resulting in a one-time non-cash expense of $24 million. For a summary of these effects, please see the rate reconciliation provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.  

Income from Continuing Operations  

 In 2007, compared to 2006:    

Income from continuing operations rose to $672 million ($2.10 diluted net income per share) from $447 million ($1.33 diluted net income per share). 2007 income from continuing operations included currency translation gains of $0.06 per share, compared to currency translation losses of $0.04 per share in 2006. 

Basic net income per share from continuing operations increased to $2.25 from $1.41.   

Discontinued Operations  

 After-tax income from discontinued operations was:    

$192 million in 2007 ($0.65 and $0.59 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). These results include a full year of operations for CICA and Sterling ($0.63 and $0.58 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively) as well as residual settlement activity relating to our 2006 AWG and CPG disposals. 

$272 million in 2006 ($0.86 and $0.80 per basic and dilutive income per share, respectively). Results in 2006 include a full year of operations for CICA and Sterling ($0.56 and $0.52 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively) and eleven months of operations and the gain on sale of AWG and CPG ($0.27 and $0.25 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively).   

 Revenue for discontinued operations decreased to $2.5 billion in 2007 from $3.4 billion in 2006 due to the inclusion in 2006 of AWG and CPG. CICA's revenue increased 21% to $2.5 billion on the strength of Sterling's Medicare Advantage product. After-tax income from discontinued operations declined $80 million to $192 million, driven by the inclusion last year of AWG and CPG results, along with the gain on the sale of those two operations. CICA's results improved $7 million to $186 million. An increase in pretax income, driven by increased revenue, was mainly offset by lower margins at  

45 

Sterling and a higher tax provision, resulting from a $28 million non-recurring tax adjustment related to the recognition of deferred taxes of CICA's foreign subsidiaries.  

 See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, "Disposal of Operations," for further information.  

Consolidated Results for 2006 Compared to 2005  

Revenue  

 In 2006, compared to the prior year:    

Commissions, fees and other increased by $153 million or 2%, driven by 2% organic revenue growth in Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and 4% organic growth in Consulting. 

Investment income increased $77 million or 53%, driven by higher interest rates and a $35 million gain recognized in connection with the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock investment to a U.K. pension plan.   

 By geography:    

U.S. revenue, which represented 41% of total revenue, increased $63 million or 2%, reflecting improved results in our retail business and increased investment income. 

Americas other than U.S. revenue increased 12% to $723 million, due to strong growth in Latin America. 

United Kingdom revenue decreased $54 million or 4%, reflecting soft market conditions in our retail and reinsurance lines, partially offset by growth in our consulting business. 

Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased 7% to $1.6 billion, as a result of acquisitions and organic growth in our retail business.   

 Asia Pacific revenue increased $38 million or 7% to $561 million, driven by acquisitions and organic revenue growth in emerging markets in Asia.   

 Expenses   

 The $144 million or 2% increase in total expenses versus 2005 is driven by:    

$141 million or 3% increase in compensation and benefits, reflecting higher salary and incentive costs, the impact of acquisitions and unfavorable foreign exchange, and 

an increase of $21 million or 1% in other general expenses, primarily reflecting a property and casualty reserve increase, hedging losses, and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a $30 million gain on the sale of our building in Spain.     

These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease of $20 million in depreciation and amortization expense, reflecting greater asset disposals and impairments in 2005.    

Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Tax and Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle  

 Income from continuing operations before provision for income tax increased $86 million to $663 million. The increase was driven by organic revenue growth across each segment along with estimated restructuring savings of $119 million, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs.  

46 

Provision for Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 32.6% in 2006 and 27.9% in 2005. Differences between the overall effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate are typically due to U.S. state income taxes and differences between U.S. and international tax rates. Changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income directly affect our effective tax rates. In 2006 and 2005, our effective tax rate also reflects the favorable resolution of tax examination issues, adjustments, and tax credits.  

Income from Continuing Operations  

 In 2006, compared to 2005:    

Income from continuing operations rose to $447 million ($1.33 dilutive net income per share) from $416 million ($1.24 dilutive net income per share). For 2006, income from continuing operations included currency translation losses of $0.04 per share, compared to currency translation gains of $0.05 per share in 2005. 

Basic net income per share from continuing operations increased to $1.41 from $1.28.   

 To compute income per share in 2005, we deducted dividends paid on the redeemable preferred stock from net income. The redeemable preferred stock was redeemed and retired in September 2005.  

Discontinued Operations  

 After-tax income from discontinued operations was:    

$272 million in 2006 ($0.86 and $0.80 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). 2006 discontinued operations include full year results for CICA and Sterling ($0.56 and $0.52 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively) and eleven months of operations and gain on sale of AWG and CPG ($0.27 and $0.25 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively.) 

$319 million in 2005 ($0.99 and $0.93 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively). Results in 2005 include full year results for CICA, Sterling, AWG and CPG ($0.69 and $0.65 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively), along with nine months of operations and the gain on sale of our Swett & Crawford operation ($0.33 and $0.31 per basic and dilutive net income per share, respectively).   

REVIEW BY SEGMENT  

General  

 Aon classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information).  

 Aon's operating segments are identified as those that report separate financial information and are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.  

 Segment revenue includes investment income generated by invested assets of that segment, as well as the impact of related derivatives. Our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in short-term obligations.  

47 

 The following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Intersegment revenues of $29 million, $59 million and $46 million were included in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services  

 Aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry. Aon was ranked by A.M. Best as the number one global insurance brokerage in 2007 based on brokerage revenues, and voted the best insurance intermediary and best reinsurance intermediary in 2007 by the readers of Business Insurance.  

 Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. Insurance premiums are cyclical, and may vary widely based on market conditions. Premium rates usually increase when the industry has heavier than expected losses or capital shortages; this situation is referred to as a "hard market." A hard market tends to increase commission revenues. Conversely, a "soft market," characterized by flat or reduced premium rates, results from increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. A soft market tends to reduce commission revenues. Hard and soft markets may be broad-based or more narrowly focused across certain product lines or geographic areas. Markets began softening in 2004. We experienced a soft market in many business lines/segments and in many geographic areas in 2007. Prices fell throughout the year, with the greatest declines seen in large and middle-market accounts. We expect the soft market to continue into 2008.  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 82% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2007. Revenues are generated primarily through:    

fees paid by clients, 

commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and 

interest income on funds held on behalf of clients.   

 Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of:    

the timing of our clients' policy renewals, 

the net effect of new and lost business, 

the timing of services provided to our clients, and 

the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.   

48 

 Our risk brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, this segment:    

addresses the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcare providers, and non-profit groups, among others; 

provides affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; 

provides reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; 

provides managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; 

provides actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and 

manages captive insurance companies.   

 We review our revenue results using the following subsegments:    

Risk Management and Insurance Brokerage encompasses our retail brokerage services, affinity products, managing general underwriting, placement and captive management services, and premium finance services in the following areas: Americas; United Kingdom; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific. In February 2008, we announced that we intend to combine our entire local, regional and national risk and insurance retail brokerage operations into a single, unified business to be called Aon Risk Services. 

Reinsurance Brokerage and Related Services (Reinsurance) offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that:     

 enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios,  

 improve capital utilization, and  

 evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide.    

Revenue  

 This table details Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue by subsegment:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 In 2007, revenue increased $431 million or 8% from 2006 due to growth in our retail and reinsurance operations, as well as higher investment income.  

49 

 This table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth in 2007 versus 2006:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Organic revenue growth for the entire segment was 3%.  

 The 4% reported growth in Americas reflects strong new business growth in our U.S. retail, Affinity and Latin America operations; favorable foreign exchange rates; and increased investment income. This growth was net of a $35 million gain in 2006 related to the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock investment to one of our U.K. pension plans.  

 United Kingdom revenue increased 11%, driven by favorable foreign currency translation, the impact of acquisitions, higher investment income and a gain on the sale of a book of business.  

 Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased 17%, driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, higher investment income and 4% organic revenue growth, most notably in emerging markets and in Continental Europe.  

 Asia Pacific revenue increased 6%, driven by positive foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth in most markets in Asia. However, this increase was partially offset by the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan and soft market conditions in Australia.  

 Reinsurance revenue increased 4%, due to favorable foreign currency translation, the impact of acquisitions and 2% organic revenue growth mainly driven by international markets, offset by soft market conditions in the U.S.  

 This table shows Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue by geographic area and total pretax income:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 U.S. revenue rose 1% over 2006 as strong new business, effective renewal book management in U.S. retail and investment income gains were partially offset by last year's gain on the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock and soft market conditions in our reinsurance business.  

 Americas other than U.S. revenue increased 13% due to strong organic revenue growth in Latin America and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.  

50 

 The 10% increase in United Kingdom revenue is driven by the impact of favorable foreign currency translation, acquisitions, higher investment income, and the gain on the sale of a book of business.  

 Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased 14% due to positive foreign currency translation, higher investment income and organic revenue growth.  

 Asia Pacific revenue increased 8% due to the impact of favorable foreign currency translation and organic revenue growth.  

Income Before Income Tax  

 Pretax income increased $196 million or 23% from 2006 to $1,037 million. In 2007, pretax margins in this segment were 17.1%, up 220 basis points from 14.9% in 2006. Contributing to increased margins and pretax income were:    

3% organic revenue growth, 

lower pension expense, 

lower restructuring expenses, 

savings from the 2005 restructuring program (primarily workforce reduction), 

$36 million of gains on the sale of businesses, and 

favorable foreign exchange rates.   

 These increases were partially offset by higher salary costs due to investing in talent and a $21 million litigation settlement for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business. In addition, in 2006, we recognized a $35 million gain on the contribution of our Scandent preferred stock and a $30 million gain on the sale of a building in Spain.  

Consulting  

 Aon Consulting is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. Our consulting segment:    

provides a broad range of consulting services, and 

generated 18% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2007.   

 We review our revenue results using the following subsegments:    

Consulting Services, which provides consulting services in six practice areas: 

1.Employee Benefits advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs that attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, retirement, executive benefits, absence management, compliance, employer commitment, investment advisory and elective benefit services. 

2.Compensation focuses on designing salary, bonus, commission, stock option, and other pay structures, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries. 

3.Management Consulting helps clients in process improvement and design, leadership, organization and human capital development, and change management. 

4.Communications advises clients on how to communicate initiatives that support their corporate vision.    

51 

5.Strategic Human Resource Consulting advises complex global organizations on talent, change and organization effectiveness issues, including assessment, selection performance management, succession planning, organization design and related people-management programs. 

6.Financial Advisory and Litigation Consulting provide consulting services, including white collar and financial statement investigation, securities litigation, financial due diligence, financial valuation services, and other related specialties. 

Outsourcing, which offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment-related services.   

Revenue  

 In 2007, revenues of $1,352 million were 5% higher than 2006. On an organic basis, revenue declined 1% from 2006.

Consulting services increased $128 million or 13%, reflecting growth in most major practice groups and geographies, favorable foreign currency translation, and the transfer of certain small units from the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. 

Outsourcing revenue declined $58 million or 20%, driven by lower revenue from AT&T. AT&T, our largest outsourcing client, terminated many of its outsourcing services with us in 2006 and terminated our remaining services during 2007.   

52 

 This table shows Consulting revenue by geographic area and pretax income:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

U.S. revenue decreased $51 million in 2007, primarily due to reduced outsourcing business triggered by the loss of revenue from AT&T (see above), partially offset by organic revenue growth in Consulting Services and a $5 million gain on the sale of an investment. 

Americas other than U.S. revenue grew 7%, reflecting improved results in Canada and favorable foreign exchange. 

United Kingdom revenue rose 21%, due to favorable foreign exchange and organic revenue growth. 

Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific revenue increased 22% and 64%, respectively, driven by favorable foreign currency translation, the transfer in of certain small units from our brokerage segment, and organic revenue growth.   

Income Before Income Tax  

 Pretax income was $189 million, an increase of $69 million or 58% from 2006. 2007 pretax margins in this segment were 14.0%, an increase of 460 basis points from 9.4% in 2006. The pretax income and margin improvement was principally driven by:    

organic revenue growth in Consulting Services, 

the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, 

lower restructuring costs, 

benefits related to the 2005 restructuring program, 

disciplined expense management in the U.S., and 

the gain on the sale of an investment.   

Unallocated Income and Expense  

 Unallocated income consists primarily of investment income (including income or loss on investment disposals and other-than-temporary impairment losses), which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments. We include invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses.  

 Through March 31, 2006, we carried our investment in Endurance warrants at fair value and recorded changes in the fair value through unallocated investment income. On March 31, 2006, we contributed the investment in Endurance warrants to our U.K. pension plans.  

 Private equities are principally carried at cost; however, where we have significant influence, they are reported using the equity method of accounting. These investments usually do not pay  

53 

dividends. LPs are accounted for using the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying LP investments flow through unallocated investment income.  

 Unallocated income also includes the operations of our Property and Casualty runoff business. We previously included results related to this business in our former Insurance Underwriting segment.  

 This table details our unallocated income and expense.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Unallocated investment income was $81 million in 2007, an increase of $66 million over 2006 and was driven by:    

an increase in income from our PEPS I investment of $61 million (see "Distributions from PEPS I" within the Key Recent Events section), and 

a decrease of $14 million in 2006 in the fair value of our investment in Endurance warrants. We contributed these warrants to the U.K. pension plans on March 31, 2006.   

 Unallocated expenses include corporate governance costs not attributable to the operating segments. These expenses increased to $132 million in 2007 from $106 million in 2006, driven by:    

higher Corporate executive staff expenses, 

resolution of a $15 million reconciliation difference in the U.K., and 

expenses associated with a review of historical equity compensation practices.   

 Property and Casualty revenues declined from $15 million in 2006 to $8 million in 2007, as that business continues to wind down. Associated expenses were $21 million in 2007 versus $93 million in 2006. 2006's results included an increase in our reserves of $81 million, reflecting adverse development, refined assumptions and additional claim information relating to programs placed in runoff.  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $9 million in 2007 to $138 million, principally due to higher interest rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  

Liquidity  

 Our operating subsidiaries obtain liquidity through selling their products and services and collecting their receivables. These subsidiaries use the funds collected to pay creditors and employees and to fund acquisitions. They segregate funds that Aon is holding on behalf of clients to satisfy policyholder liabilities, so they are not available for other uses. We believe that our operating subsidiaries will have adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company. Since government regulations limit payment of dividends from our underwriting subsidiaries, dividends depend on the subsidiaries' surplus and future earnings.  

 Our parent company's routine liquidity needs include paying corporate expenses, servicing debt, and paying dividends on Aon's outstanding stock. We meet these requirements primarily through  

54 

dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries. We may also use available liquidity for capital expenditures and repurchasing common stock.  

 Cash in our consolidated statements of financial position includes funds available for operations.  

 During 2007, we:    

redeemed $250 million of debt securities in January 2007, 

redeemed all of our remaining 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012. We converted these debentures into approximately 14 million shares of Aon common stock, and 

spent $751 million to repurchase 19.1 million of our outstanding shares of common stock.   

 In 2007, total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were $211 million, versus cash contributions of $204 million in 2006. Also in 2006, we contributed $166 million of non-cash financial instruments to certain of our U.K. plans. Under current rules and assumptions, we anticipate 2008 contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans of approximately $195 million.  

 In 2007, our principal U.K. subsidiary agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £9.4 million ($19 million) per year to one of our U.K. pension plans for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by 5.3% on each April 1. These contributions are in addition to the normal employer contributions to the plan. The trustees of the plan:    

have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2006, the estimated winding-up deficit was £300 million ($595 million at December 31, 2007 exchange rates). 

have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions and have not requested an advance.    

 Cash Flows & Financial Condition   

 Cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities.  

 Cash flows provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Insurance Underwriting operating cash flows  

 Our 2007 insurance underwriting operations include accident & health and life and certain property & casualty businesses in runoff. These insurance products have distinct differences in the timing of premiums earned and payment of future liabilities. The 2006 cash flows include the operations of AWG and CPG, sold on November 30, 2006.  

 The operating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries was $335 million for 2007, a decrease of $187 million compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily related to the sale of AWG and CPG. For 2007, operating cash flows, analyzed by major income statement component, indicated that premium and other fees collected, net of reinsurance, were $2,339 million compared to $3,546 million in 2006.  

55 

Investment and other miscellaneous income received was $183 million and $235 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 The insurance underwriting subsidiaries used revenues generated from premiums, investments and other miscellaneous income to pay claims and other cash benefits, commissions, general expenses and taxes. Claims and other cash benefits paid were $1,321 million in 2007 versus $1,632 million in 2006. Commissions and general expenses paid were $793 million for 2007, compared to $1,483 million in 2006. Tax payments for 2007 were $73 million compared to $144 million last year.  

 These subsidiaries invest and use operating cash flows to satisfy future benefits to policyholders and when appropriate, make them available to pay dividends to the Aon parent company.  

 Generally, the subsidiaries invest in highly liquid and marketable investment grade securities to support policy liabilities. These invested assets are subject to insurance regulations set forth by the various governmental jurisdictions in which they operate, both domestically and internationally. The insurance regulations may restrict both the quantity and quality of various types of assets within the portfolios.  

 The insurance subsidiaries' policy liabilities are segmented among multiple accident and health and property casualty portfolios. Those portfolios have widely varying estimated durations and interest rate characteristics. Generally, the policy liabilities are not subject to interest rate volatility risk. Therefore, in many of the portfolios, asset and policy liability duration are not closely matched. Interest rate sensitive policy liabilities are generally supported by floating rate assets.  

Funds held on behalf of clients  

 In our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, we typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of:    

premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers. These premiums held on behalf of, or due from, clients are reported as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurer. 

claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. Claims held by, or due to us and which are due to clients, are also shown as both assets and liabilities.   

 These funds held on behalf of clients are generally invested in interest bearing trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers.  

All other operating cash flows  

 The operating cash flow from our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting segments, as well as related corporate items, was $904 million in 2007 compared to $596 million in 2006. These amounts exclude the change in funds held on behalf of clients as described above. The operating cash flows depend on the timing of receipts and payments related to revenues, incentive compensation, other operating expenses and income taxes.  

 Aon uses the excess cash generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses as well as dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries to meet its liquidity needs, which consist of servicing its debt, paying dividends to its stockholders and repurchasing outstanding shares.  

Investing and Financing Activities  

 We used the consolidated cash flow from operations (net of funds held on behalf of clients) for:    

investing activities of $463 million. The cash flows used by investing activities included purchases, net of sales of investments, of $95 million; capital expenditures, net of disposals, of $170 million; and acquisition of subsidiaries, net of divestitures of $198 million. 

financing needs of $579 million. Financing uses primarily included cash dividends paid to shareholders of $176 million and net share activity of $495 million. Proceeds from financing activities are $92 million from the issuance of debt, net of repayments.   

56 

Financial Condition  

 Due to the nature of operations, insurance underwriting organizations generally do not classify assets and liabilities on their statements of financial position as current and noncurrent, and we had not previously reported a classified statement of financial position. Due to the pending sales of a majority of our underwriting operations, at December 31, 2007 we have reported our statements of financial position on a classified basis.  

 Comparing year-end 2007 with year-end 2006:    

Working capital increased $133 million to $3.4 billion. 

Receivables and Insurance premium payables declined $253 million and $206 million, respectively. The decrease in both receivables and payables reflects: 

The timing of receipts and payments, 

Client demands for risk programs, and 

The effect of foreign exchange rates 

Net assets of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries increased $223 million. 

Short-term debt increased by $210 million as a result of considering $250 million of our borrowings under our Euro facility as payable within a year. 

Goodwill increased $414 million as a result of several acquisitions made during the year in our Risk and Insurance Brokerage segment, which was slightly offset by the sale of two MGUs. 

Long-term debt decreased by $350 million, reflecting decreases in U.S. borrowings, offset in part by higher Euro facility borrowings. 

Pensions, post employment and post retirement liabilities declined by $190 million as a result of cash contributions to our various pension plans. 

Other non-current liabilities decreased by $124 million due primarily to lower restructuring reserves and a decline in our policy and contract claims reserves at our property and casualty runoff business.   

Investments  

 We invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations. In managing our investments, our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoring asset and liability durations, interest and credit risks, and regulatory requirements. We do not allocate to the operating segments invested assets or related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses.  

 See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments.  

Borrowings  

 Total debt at December 31, 2007, was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $140 million from December 31, 2006. Our long-term debt decreased by $350 million compared to year-end 2006. This decrease results from:    

redeeming $250 million of debt securities in January 2007, and 

converting $300 million of our outstanding 31/2% Senior Convertible Debentures that were due in 2012 to our common stock.   

57 

 These decreases were partially offset by higher borrowings in Europe.  

 Our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 25.6% and 30.5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 We have disclosed future payments of our long-term debt and operating lease commitments (with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year) in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 At December 31, 2007, we had a $600 million unused U.S. committed bank credit facility, which expires in February 2010, to support commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. This facility allows us to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit.  

 We also have several foreign credit facilities available. At December 31, 2007, we had available to us:    

a five-year €650 million ($942 million) multi-currency facility, of which $795 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on both our U.S. and Euro facilities. 

a £37.5 million ($74 million) facility. 

a 364-day €25 million (U.S. $36 million) facility. 

a €20 million (U.S. $29 million) open-ended facility.   

 This table shows the major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 25, 2008:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 During 2007, Standard & Poor's changed its outlook on Aon's commercial paper from positive to stable.  

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would:    

increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility, and 

increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether. Although we have committed backup lines, we cannot ensure that our financial position will not be hurt if we can no longer access the commercial paper market.   

Stockholders' Equity  

 Stockholders' equity increased $1.0 billion during 2007 to $6.2 billion, driven primarily by:    

$864 million of net income, and 

a $495 million increase in capital stock and additional paid-in-capital, principally due to the redemption of our 31/2% senior convertible debentures, as well as stock issued in connection with employee benefit plans.   

 Partially offsetting this increase was a $391 million increase in treasury stock, reflecting stock repurchases, net of reissuance of treasury stock in connection with employee benefit plans.  

58 

 Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $284 million since December 31, 2006. Compared to year-end 2006:    

net foreign exchange translation increased by $166 million because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, 

net derivative gains increased $9 million, 

net unrealized investment gains rose $3 million, and 

our net recognized losses and unrecognized prior service credits decreased by $106 million.   

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We record various contractual obligations as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but we are required to disclose them.  

 Aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $4 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. We accrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable.  

 Following the guidance of FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, and other relevant accounting guidance, we use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities ("QSPE's"), also known as special purpose vehicles, in some of our operations.  

Reinsurance Guarantee  

 In connection with the AWG transaction, we issued an indemnification which protects the purchaser from credit exposure relating to the property and casualty reserves that have been reinsured. These reinsurance recoverables amount to $846 million at December 31, 2007. We recorded a $13 million liability reflecting the fair value of this indemnification as of November 30, 2006. The value is approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2007. The indemnification represents the present value of the indemnification on the credit risk of the reinsurers.  

Premium Financing  

 Some of our U.S., U.K., Canadian, and Australian subsidiaries originate short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance their insurance premium obligations, and then sell these premium finance agreements in securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting. These sales involve:    

special purpose entities ("SPEs"), which are considered QSPEs by Statement No. 140, and following Statement No. 140, should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries), and 

multi-seller, non-qualified bank commercial paper conduit SPEs ("Bank SPEs"), which are variable interest entities according to FIN 46.   

 We have analyzed qualitative and quantitative factors related to our subsidiaries' interests in the Bank SPEs and have determined that these subsidiaries are not the sponsors of the Bank SPEs. Additionally, independent third parties:    

have made substantial equity investments in the Bank SPEs, 

have voting control of the Bank SPEs, and   

59 

generally bear the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the Bank SPEs.   

 Thus, we have concluded that non-consolidation of the Bank SPEs is appropriate given that our subsidiaries do not have significant variable interests.  

 Through the securitization agreements, we, or one of our QSPEs, sell undivided interests in specified premium finance agreements to the Bank SPEs. The total amount advanced on premium finance agreements sold to the Bank SPEs at any one time is limited by the securitization agreements to $1.8 billion. The Bank SPEs had advanced $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The:    

origination and sale of eligible premium finance agreements to the Bank SPEs increase available advances, and 

collections on previously sold agreements, which we administer, reduce available advances.   

 We record gains associated with the sale of receivables. When we calculate the gain, we include all anticipated fees we incurred for this facility. The gains, which are included in commissions, fees and other revenue in the consolidated statements of income, were $64 million, $63 million, and $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  

 We record at fair value our retained interest in the sold premium finance agreements, and report it in insurance brokerage and consulting services receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position. We also retain servicing rights for sold agreements and earn servicing fee income over the servicing period, including these servicing fees in the gain/loss calculation.  

 Because the fair value of the servicing rights approximates the estimated costs to service the receivables at December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities.  

 We estimate fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows from our retained interest in the sold receivables, using discount rates that approximate current market rates and expected future prepayment rates.  

 The Bank SPEs bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of over-collateralization required on the sales of the receivables.  

 All but the Australian facility require Aon to maintain the following covenants:    

consolidated net worth, as defined, of at least $2.5 billion, 

consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated net interest of at least 4 to 1, and 

consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3 to 1.   

 We intend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire. If there were adverse bank, regulatory, tax, or accounting rule changes, our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles would be restricted. Following the appropriate accounting standards, these special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements.  

PEPS I  

 In 2001, we sold the vast majority of our LP portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company owned by us (49%) and by a charitable trust, which we do not control, established for victims of the September 11th attacks (51%). We have not included the assets and liabilities and operations of PEPS I in our consolidated financial statements.  

60 

 In 2001, PEPS I sold approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171 million in cash and issued them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities.  

 As part of this transaction, Aon is required to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities from PEPS I in an amount equal to the unfunded LP commitments as they are requested. These fixed-maturity securities are rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2007, the unfunded commitments amounted to $44 million. These commitments have specific expiration dates, and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments.  

 We received income distributions from our preferred investment in PEPS I of $61 million during 2007, which are included in investment income. Prior to 2007, income distributions received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on various PEPS I debt instruments. Beginning in 2007, PEPS I had redeemed or collateralized all of its debt, and as a result, began to pay preferred income distributions. Whether we receive additional preferred returns will depend on the performance of the LP interests underlying PEPS I, which we expect to vary from period to period. We do not control the timing of the distributions.  

Contractual Obligations  

 The following table:    

summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2007, and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations in cash, and 

reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings.   

 We have provided additional details about some of these obligations in our notes to the financial statements:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Included in purchase obligations are contracts for information technology outsourcing. As of December 31, 2007, we can exit these obligations for termination payments of $81 million. However, given the nature of these contracts, we have included them in our contractual obligations table.  

61 

(2)Also included in purchase obligations is a $403 million contract for claims outsourcing in the U.K. We can exit this obligation after 2013 for approximately $40 million. 

(3)Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and agreements with the Trustees of our U.K. Pension Plans. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. 

(4)Excludes $57 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements will be made. 

(5)A significant amount of CICA's total contractual obligations are for future policy benefits and policy and contract claims.
