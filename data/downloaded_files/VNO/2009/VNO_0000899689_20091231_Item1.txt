PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

The Company 

Vornado Realty Trust (Vornado) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 92.5% of the common limited partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2009. All references to we, us, our, the Company and Vornado refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. 

On May 14, 2009, our Board of Trustees executed its long-planned management succession strategy and elected Michael D. Fascitelli, as our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Steven Roth, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board.  

As of December 31, 2009, we own directly or indirectly: 

Office Properties: 

(i) all or portions of 28 properties aggregating 16.2 million square feet in the New York City metropolitan area (primarily Manhattan); 

(ii) all or portions of 84 properties aggregating 18.6 million square feet in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia areas;

Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and 

· Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.  

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future. 

We may also determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund. We would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the funds performance. The fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the funds investment parameters. If we determine to raise capital through a fund, the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and could not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements. 

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

The economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the financial and capital markets have negatively affected substantially all businesses, including ours. Demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Real estate transactions and development opportunities have significantly curtailed and capitalization rates have risen. These trends have negatively impacted our 2008 and 2009 financial results, which include losses associated with abandoned development projects, valuation allowances on investments in mezzanine loans and impairments on other real estate investments. The details of these non-cash charges are described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K. It is not possible for us to quantify the impact of the above trends, which may continue in 2010 and beyond, on our future financial results. 

ACQUISITIONS and DISPOSITIONS 

We did not make any significant investments in real estate during 2009. 

On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building, in Washingtons Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000. We also sold 15 retail properties during 2009 in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000.

Financing Activities 

In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters over-allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership.  

On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30-year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039. The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. 

During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively. This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired. We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings.  

Development and Redevelopment Projects 

We are currently engaged in certain development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $200,000,000. Of this amount, $78,118,000 was expended prior to 2009 and $50,513,000 was expended during 2009. Substantially all of the estimated costs to complete these projects, aggregating approximately $71,000,000, are anticipated to be expended during 2010, of which approximately $18,000,000 will be funded by existing construction loans. We are also evaluating other development opportunities for which final plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined. There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.  

 Segment Data 

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are set forth in Note 22  Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Toys segment has 716 locations internationally. In addition, we have five partially owned nonconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships located in India, which are included in the Other segment.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The New York and Washington, DC Office Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has also experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. 

Certain Activities 

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2009, we have approximately 4,597 employees, of which 308 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 128 employees and an additional 2,512 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York Office and Washington, DC Office properties. The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 396, 176 and 582 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 495 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexanders, in which we own 32.7% and 32.4%, respectively.

Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.
