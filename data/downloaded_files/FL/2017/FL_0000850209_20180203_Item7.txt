 ﻿  

 U.S. Tax Reform   

 ﻿  

 On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (“Tax Act”) that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation also results in certain U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and imposes a new tax on U.S. cross-border payments. Furthermore, the legislation includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.  

 ﻿  

 In response to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 which provides guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation. When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the effect of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018. While our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $99 million tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings and a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion. The remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities was not significant. The 2017 charge for these provisions reflects our best estimate based on information currently available and our current interpretation of the Tax Act.   

 ﻿  

 The Tax Act includes a provision effective in 2018, to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. Under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense, or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of GAAP and we have not yet elected an accounting policy.  

 ﻿  

 As of the date of this Form 10-K, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting for this legislation. We continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, we continue to analyze other information. Accordingly, we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts. Any subsequent adjustments will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter when the analysis is complete. See Critical Accounting Policies within this item and Note 17, Income Taxes in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further details on U.S. tax reform.  

 16  

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  

 ﻿  

 In addition to reporting the Company’s financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. In the following tables, we have presented certain financial measures and ratios identified as non-GAAP such as sales excluding 53rd week, Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (“EBIT”), adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”), free cash flow, and net debt capitalization. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of our core business or which affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives.   

 ﻿  

 Additionally, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Throughout the following discussions, where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency movements.  

 ﻿  

 Fiscal year 2017 represents the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018. Accordingly, certain non-GAAP results have also been adjusted to exclude the effects of the 53rd week to assist in comparability.   

 ﻿  

 We estimate the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period.  

 ﻿  

 The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliations for free cash flow and net debt capitalization in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.

ROIC is presented below and represents a non-GAAP measure. We believe it is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. In order to calculate ROIC, we adjust our results to reflect our operating leases as if they qualified for capital lease treatment. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the presentation of these leases as if they were capital leases is appropriate. Accordingly, the asset base and net income amounts are adjusted to reflect this in the calculation of ROIC. ROIC, subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long-term incentive compensation.   

 ﻿  

 The closest U.S. GAAP measure to ROIC is Return on Assets (“ROA”) and is also represented below. ROA decreased to 7.3 percent as compared to 17.4 percent in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to litigation and other charges recorded during 2017, as well as a provisional charge of $99 million relating to tax reform as discussed earlier in this section.   

 ﻿  

 Our ROIC decreased to 11.0 percent in 2017, as compared to 15.1 percent in the prior year. Average invested capital increased compared with the prior year and earnings declined, which resulted in the overall decrease in ROIC. Average invested capital increased as a result of the effect of opening larger stores, as well as signing certain high-profile leases with longer lease terms. The earnings decline is more fully discussed on the following pages.

 Overview of Consolidated Results  

 ﻿  

 The following represents our long-term objectives and our progress towards meeting those objectives. Non-GAAP results are presented for all the periods. Please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” earlier in this section for further information relating to non-GAAP measures, including why we believe they are useful and how they are calculated.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Highlights of our 2017 financial performance include:   

   ·    Despite a challenging retail year, the Company remained highly profitable and our financial position is strong. We are well positioned for the future. 

   ·    Total sales increased 0.2 percent to a record $7,782 million, with the 53rd week contributing $95 million of sales. Footwear sales represented 82 percent of total sales for all periods presented. The overall comparable-sales gains of 6.9 percent in our Direct-to-Customer segment was not enough to offset the declines experienced by our Athletic Store Segment, which experienced a comparable-store sales decline of 4.7 percent.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   ·    Sales of the Direct-to-Customers segment increased by 8.5 percent to $1,109 million, compared with $1,022 million in 2016 and increased 110 basis points as a percentage of total sales to 14.3 percent. The direct business has been steadily increasing as a percentage of total sales over the last several years, led by the continued growth and expansion into new geographies of our store banners’ e-commerce businesses. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    EBIT margin was 7.4 percent and our adjusted EBIT margin was 9.9 percent in 2017. As compared with the prior year, the decline in the adjusted EBIT margin from 13.0 percent to 9.9 percent reflected lower pre-tax income, which was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher SG&A expenses described above.  

   ·    Net income was $284 million, or $2.22 diluted earnings per share, a decrease of 54.8 percent from the prior-year period. Adjusted net income was $510 million, or $3.99 diluted earnings per share, a decline of 17.2 percent from the corresponding non-GAAP prior-year period.  

   ·    Net income margin decreased to 3.6 percent as compared with 8.6 percent in the prior year. Our adjusted net income margin declined to 6.6 percent in 2017 as compared to 8.4 percent in the prior year.  

 ﻿  

 Highlights of our financial position for the period ended February 3, 2018 include:  

   ·    We ended the year in a strong financial position. At year end, we had $724 million of cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Cash and cash equivalents at February 3, 2018 were $849 million. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Cash capital expenditures during 2017 totaled $274 million and were primarily directed to the remodeling or relocation of 183 stores, the build-out of 94 new stores, as well as other technology and infrastructure projects. 

   ·    During 2017 we returned significant amounts of cash to our shareholders. Dividends totaling $157 million were declared and paid during 2017, and 12.4 million shares were repurchased under our share repurchase program at a cost of $467 million.

Summary of Consolidated Statements of Operations  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Sales  

 ﻿  

 All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable-store sales also includes the sales of the Direct-to-Customers segment. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Comparable-store sales for 2017 does not include the sales from the 53rd week.  

 ﻿  

 Sales of $7,782 million in 2017 increased by 0.2 percent from sales of $7,766 million in 2016. Results from 2017 include the effect of the 53rd week, which represented sales of $95 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales declined 0.5 percent as compared with 2016. Comparable-store sales declined 3.1 percent during 2017 as compared with 2016. Sales of $7,766 million in 2016 increased by 4.8 percent from sales of $7,412 million in 2015, this represented a comparable-store sales increase of 4.3 percent. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased 5.2 percent as compared with 2015.   

 ﻿  

 Gross Margin  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. Occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.  

 ﻿  

 The gross margin rate decreased to 31.6 percent in 2017 as compared to 33.9 percent in the prior year. The decline in the merchandise margin rate in 2017 primarily reflects a higher markdown rate in both our Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customer segments. The higher markdowns were the result of a more promotional environment and were necessary to ensure merchandise inventory remained current and in line with the sales trend. Although to a lesser degree, a decline in our shipping and handling revenue also negatively affected the merchandise margin for the Direct-to-Customer segment. The decline in the gross margin rate also reflects an increase in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate as compared to 2016. Rent-related costs continued to increase while our sales were relatively flat. The increase in rent-related costs was primarily driven by recently entering into leases for high-profile locations.   

 ﻿  

 Gross margin in 2016 improved 10 basis points to 33.9 percent as compared with 2015. The improvement was driven by a lower markdown rate, primarily in our Athletic Stores segment, due to an increase in full-priced selling. This improvement was partially offset by increased promotional activity within our Direct-to-Customers segment. The change in the gross margin rate also reflected an increase in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate compared to 2015. This pressured our gross margin rate as certain high-profile locations were closed for remodeling for all or part of 2016, which increased the occupancy expense rate since these locations were not generating sales while incurring tenancy costs.   

 ﻿  

 21  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 SG&A increased by $29 million and 2.0 percent in 2017, as compared with the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the SG&A rate increased by 30 basis points as compared with 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A increased by $16 million compared to the prior year. The 53rd week contributed $16 million of additional expenses, however as a percent of sales the SG&A rate remained unchanged at 19.3 percent.   

 ﻿  

 The rise in the SG&A expense rate during 2017 primarily relates to the Athletic Stores segment, partially offset by a decline in the Direct-to-Customers segment’s SG&A rate. The Athletic Stores segment reflected an increase in store-related compensation costs as a result of increased minimum wage levels. Additionally, we incurred higher expenses related to wages, such as payroll taxes and benefits. These increases in the SG&A expense rate were partially offset by declines in incentive compensation and marketing related costs.   

 ﻿  

 SG&A increased by $57 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. As a percentage of sales, the SG&A rate in 2016 decreased by 10 basis points as compared with 2015, which reflected diligent expense management specifically in store wages by our Athletic Stores segment and was partially offset by increased marketing costs incurred by our Direct-to-Customers segment in order to drive traffic to its websites.  

 ﻿  

 Depreciation and Amortization   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Depreciation and amortization increased $15 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, depreciation and amortization increased $13 million as compared with the prior year. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 reflect a rise in capital spending on store improvements, the enhancement of our digital sites, and various other technologies and infrastructure. The increase in 2016 as compared with 2015 also reflected capital spending on our relocated corporate headquarters.   

 ﻿  

 Litigation and Other Charges  

 ﻿  

 Litigation and other charges recorded totaled $211 million, $6 million, and $105 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Related to our pension litigation, we recorded charges totaling $178 million during 2017. We previously recorded a $100 million pension litigation charge during 2015. These charges relate to a class action in which the plaintiffs alleged that the Company failed to properly disclose the effects of the 1996 conversion of the U.S. retirement plan to a defined benefit plan with a cash balance formula. In February 2018, the Company’s Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. Accordingly, the Company must reform the pension plan consistent with the trial court’s order. The Company has estimated that the cost of plan reformation is $278 million as of February 3, 2018 based upon our current understanding of the court order. This amount will increase with interest until paid, as required by the provisions of the required plan reformation. The Company is currently formulating the actions and steps necessary to reform the plan.   

 ﻿  

 During 2017, we reduced and reorganized our division and corporate staff which resulted in a charge of $13 million. The substantial majority of the charge was for severance and related costs.   

 ﻿  

 22  

Impairment charges recorded during 2017 totaled $20 million. The charges related to the write-down of store fixtures and leasehold improvements of our SIX:02, Runners Point, and Sidestep stores. During 2016 and 2015, we also recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $6 million and $4 million, respectively, relating to the write down of store fixtures and leasehold improvements for our Runners Point and Sidestep stores. Also during 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge totaling $1 million to fully write down the value of an e-commerce trade name.   

 ﻿  

 Interest (Income) / Expense, Net  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The changes during 2017 and 2016 primarily relate to the amounts earned as interest income. Interest income increased by $5 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, and increased $2 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase for both periods primarily represented increased income due to higher average interest rates on our cash investments. We did not have any short-term borrowings, other than small amounts related to capital leases, for any of the periods presented.   

 ﻿  

 Income Taxes   

 ﻿  

 Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 50.8 percent, as compared with 33.9 percent in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the Tax Act. We recorded a provisional tax of $99 million for the mandatory deemed repatriation of historical foreign sourced net earnings and related items. The tax effect of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities was not significant. Also contributing to the increased rate was tax expense of $8 million related to the establishment of certain valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with Runners Point, Sidestep, and their respective e-commerce businesses. In both 2017 and 2016 we recorded tax expense of $2 million for two separate tax rate reductions in France. Partially offsetting these increases were $9 million in excess tax benefits reflecting the change required by ASC 718 adopted during 2017.   

 ﻿  

 We regularly assess the adequacy of provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may be adjusted due to new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitations. The effective tax rate, for both 2017 and 2016, includes reserve releases totaling $1 million due to audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations.   

 ﻿  

 In the fourth quarter of 2016, the U.S. Treasury issued regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987, which required us to change our method for determining the tax effects of foreign currency translation gains and losses for our foreign businesses that are operated as branches and are reported in a currency other than the currency of their parent. This change resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our income tax provision in the amount of $9 million. Also during 2016, we performed a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided to our European business by Foot Locker in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012. The new, higher valuation resulted in catch-up deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million.   

 ﻿  

 Excluding the provisional repatriation and related items, the establishment of valuation allowances, the effects of excess tax benefits, the effect of the charges recorded during 2017, the IP valuation catch-up deductions in 2016, and the effect of Section 987 Regulations on 2016, the effective tax rate for 2017 decreased as compared with 2016, primarily due to the partial year benefit of the federal income tax rate reduction as well as mix of income.   

 ﻿  

 The effective tax rate for 2016 was 33.9 percent, as compared with 35.4 percent in 2015. Excluding the reserve releases, the effects of the IP valuation catch-up deductions, the French rate change, the effect of Section 987 Regulations, and the pension litigation charge in 2015, the effective tax rate for 2016 decreased slightly as compared with 2015, primarily due to the mix of income as well as current year tax benefit related to the higher IP valuation.  

 23  

Segment Information  

 ﻿  

 As of February 3, 2018, we had two reportable segments, Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers, which were based on our method of internal reporting. We evaluate performance based on several factors, the primary financial measure of which is division results. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, pension litigation and reorganization charges, corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest (income) / expense. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal year 2018, the Company will report one reportable segment based upon the change in our method of internal reporting.

 ﻿  

 2017 compared with 2016  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales from our Athletic Stores segment decreased by 1.9 percent. The sales decline during 2017, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, was across almost all of our store banners. The Company experienced declines in sales of footwear and accessories, partially offset by a gain in apparel sales.   

 ﻿  

 Comparable-store sales decreased by 4.7 percent during 2017, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. The overall decline in comparable-store sales was primarily driven by a decrease in footwear sales. The decline in footwear sales reflected a lack of depth and variety of innovative new product at the premium end of the athletic footwear market to suit our customers’ quickly-changing style preferences. Children’s and women’s footwear sales were the major contributors to the comparable-store declines in footwear, although men’s footwear also experienced a modest comparable-store decline. Women’s court styles primarily contributed to the comparable-store decline in women’s footwear, particularly in Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, and Foot Locker Europe. The comparable store-sales decrease in children’s footwear mostly reflected declines in the basketball category. All of our store banners, with the exception of Foot Locker Canada, experienced declines in men’s footwear. Gains in men’s lifestyle running shoes were not enough to compensate for the comparable-store sales declines in basketball and court lifestyle footwear, again due to insufficient product depth.   

 ﻿  

 The comparable-store sales increase in apparel as compared to the prior year was across almost all of our store banners, with gains experienced across all genders. The gain in men’s apparel sales was driven by strong results in branded outerwear partially offset by declines in sales of private label and licensed apparel.   

 24  

 Included in our 2017 division profit was a non-cash impairment charge of $20 million related to the write-down of primarily store fixtures and leasehold improvements. SIX:02 recorded a charge of $16 million and our Runners Point and Sidestep stores recorded a charge of $4 million. The effect of the impairment charges decreased the division profit rate by 30 basis points. Most of the remaining decline in the division profit rate was related to a decrease in the merchandise margin rate reflecting higher markdowns coupled with an increase in the SG&A rate. The division profit decline was most pronounced in our European business. The 53rd week did not have a significant effect on the overall division profit rate.    

 ﻿  

 2016 compared with 2015  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales from our Athletic Stores segment increased by 4.7 percent. Of the total increase, 69 percent was generated by our domestic businesses, with almost all banners contributing to the growth. Champs Sports produced the best domestic performance, while internationally the increase was driven by our Foot Locker Europe operations. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in our Lady Foot Locker and our Runners Point and Sidestep banners. The Lady Foot Locker sales decline primarily represented the effect of store closures. The Runners Point and Sidestep banners continued to experience sales declines during 2016 as a result of assortment and traffic challenges. During 2016, we continued our focus on improving these banners by better diversifying and refining our product offerings, along with providing a more elevated in-store experience. During 2015 and 2016, we began broadening the assortment in the Runners Point stores beyond performance running to include more lifestyle running products, while the Sidestep stores shifted to lifestyle and casual footwear.   

 ﻿  

 Comparable-store sales increased by 3.6 percent as compared with 2015. Footwear sales continued to be the primary contributor to our sales growth during 2016 and reflected strong gains across men’s, children’s, and women’s footwear categories. Our children’s footwear business had a very successful year, experiencing comparable-store gains across almost all of our store banners, led by sales from Champs Sports and Kids Foot Locker. During 2016, we opened 45 new Kids Foot Locker stores, 16 of which are in Europe or Canada. The addition of these stores reflected our expectation that the momentum of our children’s business would continue. Within footwear, lifestyle running was the strongest category, while our basketball business slightly declined for the year.  

 ﻿  

 Our apparel sales also generated positive results during 2016. This category was led primarily by gains in branded and private-label apparel sales at Champs Sports. Foot Locker Europe’s apparel sales also increased during 2016 and was driven by sales of men’s branded apparel.  

 ﻿  

 Division profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 20 basis points as compared with 2015. During 2016, a $6 million non-cash impairment charge was recorded to write down the value of store fixtures and leasehold improvements for 116 Runners Point and Sidestep stores. Excluding the effect of the impairment charge, division profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 30 basis points as compared with 2015. The division profit rate improvement reflected an improved merchandise margin rate due to a lower markdown rate coupled with diligent expense management.   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 2017 compared with 2016  

 ﻿  

 Comparable-sales for the Direct-to-Customers segment increased 6.9 percent as compared with the prior year. The comparable-sales gain primarily reflected growth in our domestic and international store-banner e-commerce businesses coupled with an increase in our Eastbay business. Internationally, we continued to expand the geographies that we serve in 2017, including most notably launching our e-commerce business in Australia.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 25  

The footwear category, across men’s, women’s and children’s, was the main driver for the overall comparable-sales gains experienced for this segment. Combined, apparel and accessories sales increased modestly. The men’s and women’s lifestyle running category and men’s basketball styles primarily drove the increase in footwear sales. Additionally, the children’s footwear category contributed to the overall increase.   

 ﻿  

 Direct-to-Customers division profit, as a percent of sales, declined 180 basis points as compared with the prior year. Although sales increased during the year, the gross margin rate declined as a result of increased markdowns due to a more promotional sales environment, including additional free shipping offers that reduced our shipping and handling revenue and thereby deteriorated our gross margin. The gross margin rate decline was partially offset by an expense rate improvement relating to lower marketing costs and incentive compensation.   

 ﻿  

 2016 compared with 2015  

 ﻿  

 Comparable-sales for the Direct-to-Customers segment increased 8.8 percent as compared with 2015. Our domestic and international store-banner websites continued to represent the majority of the overall growth in sales, which was partially offset by declines in the Eastbay, Runners Point, and Sidestep e-commerce businesses. The overall increase in sales was led by our footwear category. Consistent with our Athletic Stores segment, footwear sales increased in men’s, women’s, and children’s. The positive sales increase in men’s footwear was primarily driven by strong gains by the Jordan brand. The increase in women’s footwear was driven by casual styles.   

 ﻿  

 Direct-to-Customers division profit, as a percent of sales, declined 100 basis points as compared with 2015. The decline in the division profit rate reflected increased spending in marketing-related costs, which was incurred in order to drive traffic to our websites. Also contributing to the decline in the division profit rate was a decrease in the gross margin rate as a result of greater promotional activity by our domestic e-commerce business, especially Eastbay.   

 ﻿  

 Corporate Expense   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $16 million, $14 million, and $11 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 The allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions is adjusted annually based upon an internal study; accordingly, the allocation increased by $4 million in 2017, thus reducing corporate expense. Excluding the corporate allocation change, corporate expense decreased by $18 million as compared to 2016. This was primarily due to a $13 million decline in incentive compensation, which reflects the Company’s underperformance relative to its plan. Share-based compensation declined by $7 million and is also primarily related to the portion of share-based compensation that is tied directly to the Company’s performance. Additionally, the decline in corporate expense also reflects a decrease of $4 million relating to the prior-year corporate headquarters relocation costs. These decreases were partially offset by a $2 million litigation charge, increased corporate support costs, such as information technology and real estate management, and increased depreciation and amortization expense. The effect of the 53rd week on corporate expense was not significant.  

 ﻿  

 Corporate expense decreased by $7 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The annual adjustment of the allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions reduced corporate expense by $9 million. This was partially offset by an increase of $3 million in depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense. During 2016, we also incurred $4 million of expenses related to our corporate headquarters relocation within New York City, as compared with $3 million spent during 2015. The remaining change primarily reflected lower incentive compensation expense in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 26  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources   

 ﻿  

 Liquidity   

 ﻿  

 Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from earnings, while the principal uses of cash have been: to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; to finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, Internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; to make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and to fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and future cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund these requirements.   

 ﻿  

 As of February 3, 2018, we had $849 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $669 million was held in foreign jurisdictions. After accounting for the deemed repatriation tax required by the Tax Act, our offshore cash can be repatriated without significant additional U.S. income tax cost. In connection with the Tax Act, the Company recorded a $99 million tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings and related items. The tax for the mandatory deemed repatriation is payable over an 8 year period beginning with 2017, 8 percent is payable for years 1 to 5, 15 percent in year 6, 20 percent in year 7, and 25 percent in the final year.  

 ﻿  

 The Company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of February 3, 2018, approximately $758 million remained available under our current $1.2 billion share repurchase program.   

 ﻿  

 On February 20, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share to be paid on May 4, 2018, representing an 11 percent increase over the previous quarterly per share amount.  

 ﻿  

 As discussed further in the Legal Proceedings note under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” during 2017, in connection with our pension litigation, we recorded pre-tax charges of $178 million. The accrued amount as of February 3, 2018 was $278 million and is classified as a long-term liability. The Company has exhausted all legal remedies and will reform the pension plan. The Company will be working with the plaintiffs’ counsel and the court on the specific steps needed to implement the trial court’s judgment. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we deposited $150 million into a qualified settlement fund, classified as restricted cash. This settlement fund will be used for future pension contributions and plaintiffs’ legal costs related to the pension plan reformation. Also, the Company expects to make a $128 million contribution to the pension plan during 2018. The timing and the amount of actual contributions to the pension plan are dependent on the funded status of the plan and various other factors, such as interest rates and the performance of the plan’s assets.  

 ﻿  

 Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, as well as other factors listed under the heading “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” could affect our ability to continue to fund our liquidity needs from business operations.   

 ﻿  

 Maintaining access to merchandise that we consider appropriate for our business may be subject to the policies and practices of our key suppliers. Therefore, we believe that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with these key suppliers. In 2017 and 2016, we purchased approximately 93 percent and 91 percent, respectively, of our merchandise from our top five suppliers and expect to continue to obtain a significant percentage of our athletic product from these suppliers in future periods. Approximately 67 percent in 2017 and 68 percent in 2016 was purchased from one supplier — Nike, Inc.  

 ﻿  

 Planned capital expenditures in 2018 are $229 million and lease acquisition costs related to our operations in Europe are $1 million. Capital expenditures reflect $124 million dedicated to elevating our in-store experience through continued relocation and remodels in major cities and key markets. It also includes the remodeling and expansion of over 100 existing stores, as well as the planned opening of approximately 40 stores, primarily related to the continued expansion of Foot Locker in Europe and our entry into Asia in a limited number of locations.   

 27  

Planned spending for 2018 also includes $105 million for digital and other investments, including enhancements to our mobile and web platforms, the global roll-out of our new point-of-sale software, expanding data analytics capabilities, and supply chain initiatives. We have the ability to revise and reschedule much of the anticipated capital expenditure program, should our financial position require it.  

 ﻿  

 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)  

 ﻿  

 In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.   

 ﻿  

 The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Operating Activities  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The amount provided by operating activities reflects income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include non-cash impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense and related tax benefits. The decline in 2017 primarily reflects the decrease in net income partially offset by working capital improvements.   

 ﻿  

 During 2017, we contributed $25 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan. We contributed $33 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and $3 million to our Canadian qualified pension plan in 2016. During 2015, we contributed $4 million to the U.S. qualified pension plan. The amounts and timing of pension contributions are dependent on several factors, including asset performance. Cash paid for income taxes was $237 million, $341 million, and $283 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Investing Activities  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Capital expenditures in 2017 were $274 million, an increase of $8 million as compared with the prior year. The increase was due to increased spending on technology projects and cash payments related to the prior year capital program. During 2017, we completed the remodeling or relocation of 183 existing stores and opened 94 new stores. As of the end of fiscal 2017, approximately 40 percent of our Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and Footaction stores have been remodeled to their respective new store formats. Capital expenditures in 2016 were $266 million, primarily related to the remodeling or relocation of 218 existing stores, and the build-out of 96 new stores. The increase in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily related to our corporate headquarters build out and two new flagship stores.  

 28  

The Company invested $15 million in a privately-held company during 2017, which was accounted for as a cost method investment.   

 ﻿  

 During the third quarter of 2015, we completed an asset acquisition for $2 million involving 10 previously franchised Runners Point and Sidestep stores in Switzerland.   

 ﻿  

 Financing Activities  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of our return to shareholders initiatives, including our share repurchase program and cash dividend payments, as follows:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 During 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 12,413,590 shares, 6,984,643 shares, and 6,693,100 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, respectively. Additionally, the Company declared and paid dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.31, $0.275, and $0.25 per share in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid $10 million, $7 million and $9 million, respectively, to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of share-based equity awards. Offsetting the amounts above were proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $18 million, $33 million, and $69 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 During 2016, we paid fees of $2 million in connection with the credit agreement, see below for further details. During 2016 and 2015, we made payments relating to capital lease obligations of $1 million and $2 million, respectively. These obligations were recorded in connection with the acquisition of the Runners Point Group.  

 ﻿  

 Capital Structure  

 ﻿  

 On May 19, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with our banks (“2016 Credit Agreement”). The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on May 19, 2021. During the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement, we may also increase the commitments by up to $200 million, subject to customary conditions. Interest is determined, at our option, by the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.125 percent to 0.375 percent, or a Eurodollar rate, determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.125 percent to 1.375 percent depending on availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement. In addition, we are paying a commitment fee of 0.20 percent per annum on the unused portion of the commitments.  

 ﻿  

 The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of our domestic store assets, including inventory assets, accounts receivable, cash deposits, and certain insurance proceeds. We are not required to comply with any financial covenants unless certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, or if availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement does not exceed the greater of $40 million and 10 percent of the Loan Cap (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement). There are no restrictions relating to the payment of dividends and share repurchases as long as no default or event of default has occurred and the aggregate principal amount of unused commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement is not less than 15 percent of the lesser of the aggregate amount of the commitments and the Borrowing Base, determined as of the preceding fiscal month and on a proforma basis for the following six fiscal months. We do not currently expect to borrow under the facility in 2018, other than amounts used to support standby letters of credit.  

 ﻿  

 Credit Rating  

 ﻿  

 As of March 29, 2018, our corporate credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are BB+ and Ba1, respectively. In addition, Moody’s Investors Service has rated our senior unsecured notes Ba2.  

 29  

Debt Capitalization and Equity (non-GAAP Measure)  

 ﻿  

 For purposes of calculating debt to total capitalization, we include the present value of operating lease commitments in total net debt. Total net debt including the present value of operating leases is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The present value of operating leases is discounted using various interest rates ranging from 2.5 percent to 14.5 percent, which represent our incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the inclusion of the present value of operating leases in total debt is useful to our investors, credit constituencies, and rating agencies.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Including the present value of operating leases, net debt capitalization percent increased 590 basis points in 2017, primarily reflecting the effect of new high-profile leases and ongoing lease renewals coupled with foreign exchange fluctuations. Also contributing to the net capitalization increase during 2017 was a $197 million decline in our cash and cash equivalents, which primarily reflected the $150 million deposit to a qualified settlement fund in connection with the pension litigation matter.  

 ﻿  

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments   

 ﻿  

 The following tables represent the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at February 3, 2018:

 ﻿  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 ﻿  

 The majority of our contractual obligations relate to operating leases for our stores. Future scheduled lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of February 3, 2018 are described in the table under Contractual Obligations and Commitments on the preceding page and with additional information in the Leases note in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”   

 ﻿  

 We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. Also, our financial policies prohibit the use of derivatives for which there is no underlying exposure.   

 ﻿  

 In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, we may be obligated for certain lease commitments transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot be readily determined, we believe that the resolution of such contingencies will not significantly affect our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. We also operate certain stores for which lease agreements are in the process of being negotiated with landlords. Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that leases will be executed.  

 ﻿  

 Critical Accounting Policies   

 ﻿  

 Our responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements requires diligent application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, our accounting policies and methods are those specifically required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” is a summary of the most significant accounting policies. In some cases, we are required to calculate amounts based on estimates for matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments.  

 ﻿  

 Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales  

 ﻿  

 Merchandise inventories for the Athletic Stores segment are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (“RIM”). The RIM is commonly used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its practicality. Under the retail method, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis.   

 ﻿  

 The RIM is a system of averages that requires estimates and assumptions regarding markups, markdowns and shrink, among others, and as such, could result in distortions of inventory amounts. Judgment is required for these estimates and assumptions, as well as to differentiate between promotional and other markdowns that may be required to correctly reflect merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market. Reserves are established based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. The failure to take permanent markdowns on a timely basis may result in an overstatement of cost under the retail inventory method. The decision to take permanent markdowns includes many factors, including the current retail environment, inventory levels, and the age of the item. We believe this method and its related assumptions, which have been consistently applied, to be reasonable.  

 31  

Impairment of Long-Lived Tangible Assets and Goodwill   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 32  

 Legal Contingencies  

 ﻿  

 We are exposed to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The accrual is recorded based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. In 2017, we recorded pre-tax charges of $178 million related to the pension plan litigation. We previously recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million related to this matter in 2015.  

 ﻿  

 There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. We believe the accruals recorded within the consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.    

 ﻿  

 Pension and Postretirement Liabilities  

 ﻿  

 We review all assumptions used to determine our obligations for pension and postretirement liabilities annually with our independent actuaries, taking into consideration existing and future economic conditions and our intentions with regard to the plans. The assumptions used are:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 33  

   Trend Rate   

 We maintain two postretirement medical plans, one covering certain executive officers and key employees (“SERP Medical Plan”), and the other covering all other associates. With respect to the SERP Medical Plan, a one percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would change this plan’s accumulated benefit obligation by approximately $3 million and $2 million, depending on if the change was an increase or decrease, respectively. 

 With respect to the postretirement medical plan covering all other associates, there is limited risk to us for increases in health care costs since, beginning in 2001, new retirees have assumed the full expected costs and then-existing retirees have assumed all increases in such costs.   

   ﻿       

   Mortality Assumptions   

 In 2017, the mortality table used to determine the U.S. pension obligations was updated to the modified RP-2017 mortality table with generational projection using modified MP-2017 for both males and females and terminated vested participants. The mortality table was updated as the Company’s actual experience more closely matched the RP-2017 than the previous table. In 2016, the mortality table used to determine the pension obligation was the RP-2000 mortality table with generational projection using scale AA for both males and females. This table was also used to value the Canadian pension obligations for 2017 and 2016. 

 For the SERP Medical Plan, the mortality assumption used to value the 2017 obligation was updated to the RPH-2017 table with generational projection using MP-2017, while in the prior year the obligation was valued using the RPH-2016 table with generational projection using MP-2016, which represents the most recent study from the Society of Actuaries.    

 Income Taxes  

 ﻿  

 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdiction and to use our judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset. Estimates of taxable income are based upon our long-range strategic plans.   

 ﻿  

 A one percent change in the overall statutory tax rate for 2017 would have resulted in a change of $1 million to the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge or credit to income tax expense depending on whether the tax rate change was a decrease or an increase.  

 ﻿  

 We have operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals of tax contingencies require us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual results could vary from these estimates.  

 ﻿  

 The Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. It requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the law and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the law will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation underlying our income tax accruals. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, collect data and prepare the necessary calculations, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially affect our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.  

 ﻿  

 Excluding the effect of any nonrecurring items that may occur, we expect the 2018 effective tax rate to approximate 27.5 percent. The actual tax rate will vary if the level of stock option exercise activity and the stock price at the vesting or exercise date differs from our expectations. Additionally, the tax rate will also depend on the level and mix of income earned in the United States, as compared with our international operations.
