ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of Danaher Corporations (Danaher, Company, we, us, our) financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Companys MD&A is divided into four main sections:  

       Overview  

       Results of Operations  

       Liquidity and Capital Resources  

       Critical Accounting Policies  

OVERVIEW  

General  

We strive to create shareholder value through:  

       delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for our products and services;  

       upper quartile financial performance compared to our peer companies; and  

       upper quartile cash flow generation from operations compared to our peer companies.  

To accomplish these goals, we use a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM, which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Within the DBS framework, we pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives intended to improve our performance, including initiatives relating to manufacturing improvement, idea generation, product development and commercialization and global sourcing of materials and services. To further these objectives we also acquire businesses that either strategically fit within our existing business portfolio or expand our portfolio into a new and attractive business area. We believe that many acquisition opportunities remain available within our target markets. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect our overall growth and operating results. We also continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment.  

Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. In 2008, approximately 53% of Danahers sales were derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. For example, in those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Companys customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. However, the broad impact of the worldwide credit market turmoil and economic downturn have negatively impacted the growth rates of most of the Companys businesses and resulted in the Companys overall revenue from existing businesses contracting in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year fourth quarter.  

Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Companys individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Companys order rates are highly indicative of the Companys revenue in the short term and thus a key measure of anticipated performance.  

Significant Acquisitions  

In November 2007, the Company significantly expanded its test and measurement business with the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. Tektronix is part of Danahers test and measurement business

 included in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The Company funded the purchase price of the Tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the Companys November 2007 common stock offering, and to a lesser extent from available cash.  

Business Performance  

While differences exist among the Companys businesses, the Company experienced overall growth during 2008 as compared to 2007. As a result of the deterioration in global economic conditions that occurred in the latter part of 2008, all of the year-over-year growth from existing businesses experienced by the Company occurred in the first nine months of the year. Demand weakened significantly in the fourth quarter resulting in a decline in revenue from existing businesses in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter decline, the Companys full year growth was led by strength throughout the entire year in the Companys environmental, acute care diagnostic and life sciences businesses. Growth from the test and measurement business during the first nine months of 2008 was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the fourth quarter due to weak demand. Sales growth was also impacted adversely in the fourth quarter 2008 due to weak demand in the Companys industrial and consumer oriented businesses as demand slowed considerably in the dental technologies, product identification, enterprise network performance management and mechanics hand tools businesses.  

The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and geographies served. The Companys future performance will depend on its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies served, including contraction in most of the worlds major economies, access to funding in the global capital markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of competitors, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and volatility in raw material costs. The Company regularly evaluates market needs and conditions with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. Consistent with this approach, and in light of the worsening global economic environment, the Company initiated a series of restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of 2008 to better position the Companys cost base for future periods. Please refer to Results of OperationsRestructuring and Other Related Charges below for additional discussion.  

Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, a substantial portion of its sales and profits are generated in foreign currencies. Sales and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates. With limited exceptions, the Company has accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Please refer to Financial Instruments and Risk Management section below for additional information.  

On average, the U.S. dollar weakened against other major currencies during 2008, particularly during the first half of 2008. The U.S. Dollar strengthened against other major currencies in the second half of 2008 and, as of December 31, 2008, U.S. Dollar exchange rate levels were stronger than as of the end of 2007. Currency exchange rates increased reported sales for 2008 by approximately 2.0% as compared to 2007. Given the lower overall profit margins in the Companys European businesses, currency rate changes lowered year-over-year comparisons of reported operating profit margins. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2008 prevail throughout 2009, currency exchange rates will adversely impact 2009 sales and operating results relative to the Companys performance in 2008. Additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the Companys sales and results of operations. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would benefit the Companys sales and results of operations on an overall basis.

Outlook  

During the fourth quarter of 2008, worldwide credit markets and overall global economic conditions deteriorated significantly, resulting in a general decline in worldwide demand for the Companys products and services. The economic uncertainties that continue to exist suggest that global demand will continue to contract, at least in the early months of 2009. While none of the Companys businesses are insulated from the slowing demand, the contraction is anticipated to impact adversely certain of the Companys businesses more than others. In particular, the Companys industrial and consumer businesses are likely to be most impacted with the medical technologies and environmental businesses less affected. The Company expects further contraction in the industrial technologies and tools and components segments as well as portions of the test and measurement businesses. To minimize the impact of the recessionary economic conditions, as discussed below, the Company initiated restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2008, and will continue to assess market conditions and take actions as it deems necessary to appropriately position its businesses in light of the economic environment. The Company currently estimates additional pre-tax restructuring costs in the range of $40 to $60 million to be incurred during 2009. Consistent with past practice, the Company will also continue to actively manage working capital with a view to maximizing cash flow.  

Although recent distress in the financial markets has not had a significant impact on the Companys financial position or liquidity as of the filing date of this Report, management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions. If further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely affect the Companys access to the commercial paper markets, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing committed credit facilities to provide short-term funding. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional discussion.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Consolidated sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 15.0% over the comparable period of 2007. Sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth, acquisitions contributed 10.5% growth and currency translation provided 2.0% growth. The majority of the growth related to currency translation occurred during the first nine months of 2008, as currency translation adversely impacted results in the fourth quarter of 2008. References in this report to sales from existing businesses include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition, but exclude currency effect.  

The growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of ChemTreat in July 2007 and Tektronix in November 2007, both of which are included in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The acquisitions of other, smaller businesses in the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments also contributed to the year-over-year growth. The Company acquired seventeen businesses and twelve businesses during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

Operating profit margins from continuing operations for the Company were 14.7% in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Charges recorded related to the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities reduced the Companys 2008 operating profit margins by 65 basis points. In addition, the dilutive impact of acquisitions reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 80 basis points, including the adverse impact of $60 million ($45 million or $0.13 per diluted share, net of tax) of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company also incurred Tektronix related charges in 2007 associated with acquired in-process research and development that affected year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points. A gain recorded in the second quarter of 2007 from the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit also affected year-over-year comparisons of operating profit margins by 10 basis points.

Restructuring and Other Related Charges  

In light of the worsening global economic environment, the Company initiated a series of restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of 2008 to better position the Companys cost base for future periods. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other related charges totaling $82.0 million ($61.5 million, net of tax or $0.18 per diluted share) as indicated in the following table ($ in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The restructuring and other related charges are intended to improve future operational efficiency through targeted workforce reductions and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures. Approximately 93% of the total pre-tax charges require cash payments, which are being funded with cash generated from operations. Through December 31, 2008, approximately $20 million of required cash payments had been made. The majority of the remaining cash expenditures are expected to occur in the first quarter of 2009. As a result of these restructuring activities, the Company expects recurring pre-tax savings to exceed $100 million during 2009.  

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities resulted in net workforce reductions of approximately 1,800 associates and thirteen facility closures, the majority of which have been completed as of December 31, 2008. Remaining workforce reductions and facility closure activities associated with the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities to be completed during 2009 are not significant. In conjunction with the closing of facilities, certain inventory was written off as unusable in future operating locations. This inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials, which were either redundant to inventory at the facilities being merged or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated. In addition, property, plant and equipment at closed facilities were evaluated based on expected future use and written down to fair value where impairments were identified.  

In the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings, the pre-tax restructuring and related charges, consisting of $76 million cash charges and $6 million non-cash charges, are reflected in the following captions ($ in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The impact of these restructuring and related charges in each of the Companys segments is discussed in the following analysis of the segment results of operations.

Table of Contents 

Fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Professional Instrumentation segment by 60 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 295 basis points, including the adverse impact of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of Tektronix (which charges will not recur in 2009). The Company also incurred Tektronix-related charges in 2007 associated with acquired in-process research and development that affected year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 170 basis points.  

Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Tektronix acquisition.  

Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment  

Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 51% of segment sales for 2008, increased 15.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.5% growth while acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation accounted for 1.5% growth.  

The segments water quality businesses experienced high-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily a result of strong laboratory and process sales, reflecting in part the results of increased sales force investments and penetration into emerging markets. Growth in sales was experienced in all major geographic regions with particular strength in Asia where sales increased at a double digit rate. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth was increased demand by municipalities for the businesses ultraviolet disinfection water treatment product offerings which experienced a mid-teens sales growth rate.  

The retail petroleum equipment business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales of payment and point of sale retail and payment solution product offerings offset by a decline in dispensing equipment sales primarily in North America and Europe. An increase in demand for the business vapor recovery products in North America also contributed to the year-over-year sales growth, primarily related to an enhanced vapor recovery product that received regulatory approval and launched during the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Test and Measurement. Sales from the Companys test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 49% of segment sales for 2008, grew 70% compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses were essentially flat while acquisitions accounted for 68.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 2.0% growth.  

Sales growth from existing businesses was driven primarily by performance during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of strong sales of the business thermography and precision measurement product offerings as well as strong growth from investments in emerging markets. While demand for the business thermography products continued to increase as compared to 2007 during the fourth quarter, demand slowed for the business traditional industrial digital hand-held instruments and precision measurement products resulting in a mid-single digit rate sales decline in the quarter and offsetting the growth experienced in the first nine months. In addition, the sales decline in the fourth quarter is a result of reductions of inventory in the distribution channel as well as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility on customer demand in certain emerging markets. Sales also declined throughout 2008 in the business enterprise network performance management line of business as a result of generally lower telecommunications demand and slower information technology spending by customers.  

2007 COMPARED TO 2006  

Segment sales for Professional Instrumentation increased 22.0% for 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the segments strategic lines of business. Price increases accounted for approximately 1.5% sales growth and the impact of that increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses.

Operating profit margins were 20.1% in 2007 compared to 21.5% in 2006. Operating profit margin improvements of 135 basis points related to existing businesses were more than offset by the dilutive impact of lower operating profit margins of acquired businesses, which reduced segment operating profit margins by 260 basis points compared to 2006. Included in the dilutive impact on operating margins from acquired businesses is approximately $68 million (185 basis points) in charges associated with the acquisition of Tektronix, primarily related to acquired in-process research and development activities, acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue. In addition, year over year comparisons are impacted by a gain on the sale of real estate during 2006 and recovery of certain previously written-off receivables during 2006 which increased that periods operating profit margins by 15 basis points. Leverage on increased sales volume in 2008 contributed positively to overall Professional Instrumentation operating profit margins.  

Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment  

Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 60% of segment sales for 2007, increased 16.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 7.0% growth and currency translation accounted for 3.5% growth.  

The Companys water quality businesses experienced low-double digit revenue growth for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of strength in sales of laboratory and process instrumentation products in all major geographic regions. In addition, sales of the Companys ultraviolet water treatment systems grew double-digit compared to 2006. Investment in sales forces and other growth initiatives, in addition to continued penetration of the Asian wastewater market, including a significant reclamation project in Australia, contributed to the growth. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of ChemTreat in July 2007.  

The retail petroleum equipment business experienced low-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. The business point of sale payment systems and service business enjoyed robust growth in 2007, primarily in Europe. In addition, the business experienced strong demand during 2007 in North America and China for its leak detection systems that were introduced during the period. These sales gains were offset by difficult prior year comparisons, a result of strong dispenser sales in 2006 due to extensive refurbishment activity in Europe and regulatory mandates in Mexico that did not repeat in 2007.  

Test and Measurement. Sales from the Companys test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 40% of segment sales for 2007, grew 31.5% compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 8.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 20.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 3.5% growth.  

New product offerings in the thermography, power quality test and process calibration markets generated strong sales in the electrical and industrial channels in all major geographical areas during 2007. The network test business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Large orders from telecommunications carriers in the United States during the first three quarters of 2007 and cable test equipment sales in Europe were the primary drivers of the network test growth. Acquisition growth was primarily related to the acquisition of Tektronix in addition to several smaller acquisitions throughout the year.  

MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES  

The Medical Technologies segment consists of businesses that offer research and clinical medical professionals various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2008 COMPARED TO 2007  

Segment sales for Medical Technologies increased 9.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth was primarily driven by the segments acute care diagnostics, life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses. Price increases accounted for approximately 1.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses.  

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Medical Technologies segment by 80 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 40 basis points. A decline in demand for certain products in the dental technologies business, in addition to increased sales force investment and research and development costs within the life sciences business, also adversely impacted year-over-year operating margin profit comparisons.  

Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment  

Revenues in the segments acute care diagnostics business grew at mid-single digit rate in 2008 as compared to 2007. The year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to strong aftermarket consumables sales for the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation, sales of the business compact version of its blood gas analysis instrument as well as sales resulting from the launch of the business AQT cardiac marker during 2008. Sales growth was experienced in all major geographic regions during the year. Particularly strong growth in emerging markets during the first nine months of the year moderated during the fourth quarter as a result of currency exchange rate volatility and economic uncertainty.  

The segments life science instrumentation business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2008 as compared to 2007. Continued strong sales of the business pathology diagnostics instrumentation and consumables offerings as well as compound microscopy product offerings drove the majority of this growth. All major geographic regions experienced growth. The acquisition of Surgipath Medical Industries in the fourth quarter of 2008 is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the pathology diagnostics business.

Table of Contents 

The segments dental business revenue in 2008 was essentially flat as compared to 2007. Revenues in the dental technologies business grew at a mid-single digit rate through the first nine months of 2008 primarily driven by strong demand for imaging equipment. However, a significant decline in demand in the fourth quarter for the majority of the products in the dental technologies business, including imaging equipment, more than offset this earlier growth resulting in low-single digit sales declines for the year. The decline in demand is primarily attributable to customer decisions to cancel or delay capital spending as well as inventory reductions in certain distribution channels. Offsetting the 2008 sales declines in the dental technologies business was low-single digit growth in the dental consumables business. Sales growth in the dental consumables businesses was primarily due to strong sales of general dentistry consumables and increased demand for endodontic and infection control products, offset by lower demand in the orthodontia product line.  

2007 COMPARED TO 2006  

Segment sales increased 35% for 2007 compared to 2006. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed 1.0% to overall sales growth in 2007 compared to 2006.  

Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing businesses contributed 100 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement in 2007. Improvements in the operating profit margins of the dental consumable, acute care diagnostic and life sciences instrumentation businesses were partially offset by lower operating profit margins in the dental equipment businesses. Recently acquired businesses adversely impacted 2007 operating profit margins by 40 basis points as compared to 2006. In addition, on a comparative basis, 2007 operating margins benefited approximately 50 basis points from the adverse impact on 2006 operating margins that resulted from charges recorded associated with the fair value of acquired inventory related to the acquisition of Sybron.  

Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment  

The segments acute care diagnostics business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Increasing sales of diagnostic instruments in Europe (particularly Russia) in 2007 contributed to this sales growth. The North American and Asia/Pacific markets also contributed to the growth, although at somewhat lower rates than those experienced in the European markets. New product introductions resulting from the business continued research and development efforts also contributed to this growth.  

The segments life science instrumentation business experienced mid-teens revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Robust microscopy demand, particularly confocal microscopes, in North America and Asia were the primary growth drivers. The integration of Vision with Leica Microsystems was completed in 2007 and generated incremental revenue growth, the majority of which has been included as a component of acquisition growth during 2007. Visions revenue grew approximately 30% in 2007 compared to 2006 when it was a stand-alone company.  

The segments dental business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. The business experienced increased sales volumes in its restorative and orthodontia products as well as in the instrument and treatment unit product offerings across all major geographies. In addition, increased sales of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging products contributed to the revenue growth in the European market. This growth was partially offset by a decline in instrument and treatment unit sales to Asia reflecting a weak overall Japanese market and the need to re-register certain products with regulatory authorities in South Korea.  

INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES  

Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic lines of business, motion and product

 identification, and two focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, and sensors and controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; aerospace safety devices and defense articles; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of the power quality businesses that were part of this segment and all 2007 and 2006 results of the segment have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2008 COMPARED TO 2007  

Segment sales for Industrial Technologies increased 3.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth experienced for the majority of the year in the segments motion and niche aerospace and defense and sensors lines of business was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the segments product identification line of business, primarily in the second half of 2008. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses.  

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Industrial Technologies segment by 70 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, gains recorded in 2007 due to the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit and from the sale of real estate adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points. Operating profit margin improvements during 2008, primarily relating to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in late 2007, partially offset these adverse impacts.  

Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment  

Motion Sales in the segments motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2008, increased 4.0% over 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 1.0% growth while currency translation accounted for 3.0% growth during 2008. There were no acquisitions in the motion businesses in 2008 or 2007.  

37  

Table of Contents 

Sales growth from existing businesses during 2008 was primarily driven by demand for custom motors and drives, particularly in the elevator application, flat panel display and aerospace and defense end markets. Largely offsetting this growth was weakness in demand for the business standard motors and drives product offerings throughout the year, and in particular during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe. In addition, during the fourth quarter, demand for products supporting the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets, as well as other industrial applications, declined at levels in excess of the declines experienced during the first nine months of the year.  

Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2008. Sales from the segments product identification businesses decreased 1.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 3.5% decline in sales while currency translation contributed 1.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 0.5% to revenue growth in 2008.  

Through the first nine months of 2008, sales growth driven by increased demand for both consumable products and services associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment had partially offset a decline in equipment sales. Further weakening of equipment demand during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe, resulted in double-digit year-over-year declines in equipment sales during the quarter as customers cancelled or delayed purchases. The declines in equipment sales more than offset the sales growth from consumables and services experienced throughout the majority of 2008. In addition, sales in the integrated scanning system product line declined throughout 2008 due to lower capital expenditures by the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the timing of completion of various large projects for other large parcel post and retail customers.  

Focused Niche Businesses. Revenues in the segments existing niche businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven primarily by high-single digit sales growth in the segments aerospace and defense businesses and low-single digit sales growth in the segments sensors and controls businesses. Sales growth from the sensors and controls business primarily occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as demand weakened during the fourth quarter resulting in essentially flat segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the comparable period of 2007.  

2007 COMPARED TO 2006  

Price increases contributed 1.5% of sales growth compared to 2006 which impact is reflected in sales from existing businesses.  

Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing businesses contributed 85 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement for 2007 as compared to 2006. This margin improvement was driven in part by continued margin expansion in the motion businesses reflecting pricing and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of lower levels of lower-margin USPS sales in 2007 compared to 2006 within the product identification business. In addition, during 2007, the segment recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million upon collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit, which improved operating profit margins by 40 basis points for 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by new acquisitions, restructuring activities, spending for product development and emerging market sales force initiatives.  

Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment  

Motion Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2007, increased 2.5% over 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 1.0% decrease in sales and currency translation accounted for 3.5% growth in sales during 2007. There were no acquisitions in the business in 2007 or 2006.  

During 2007, the motion business experienced sales growth primarily in the elevator markets as a result of global conversions to more energy efficient systems and new construction demand in Asia. Demand in OEM applications in Europe also contributed year-over-year sales growth. These growth drivers, however, were more than offset by year-over-year sales declines resulting from weakness in certain technology end markets as well as declines in the miniature motors business reflecting reduced customer demand.

Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28% of segment sales in 2007. Sales from the Companys product identification businesses increased 3.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 1.0% decline while currency translation contributed 3.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 1.0% to revenue growth in 2007.  

The 2007 decline in sales from existing operations resulted from the business completing several large systems installation projects with the USPS during 2006 which did not repeat in 2007. Sales for the business non-USPS marking products grew at a mid-single digit rates during 2007 compared to 2006. Strong equipment and after-market sales, particularly in China, Latin America and Europe, were the primary drivers of this growth facilitated by increased investments in the business sales force and new product launches in these regions.  

Focused Niche Businesses The segments niche businesses experienced a mid-single digit growth rate in 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the Companys aerospace and defense businesses, partially offset by sales declines in the Companys sensors and controls business, reflecting continued softness in the semi-conductor and electronic assembly markets.  

TOOLS & COMPONENTS  

The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; and custom-designed fasteners and components.

Table of Contents 

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Tools and Components segment by 30 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. Elevated commodity costs and lower overall sales volumes in the mechanics hand tools business also adversely impacted operating profit margins. A 2008 gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire, coupled with the impact of charges recorded in 2007 associated with the fire, favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points. Commodity costs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and, assuming they remain at the current levels, will provide a benefit to the segment in 2009.  

Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment  

Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 69% of segment sales in 2008, declined 5.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses declined 6.0% during 2008, offset by a 0.5% positive impact as a result of foreign currency translation. The sales decline is primarily attributable to weak North American demand in both the retail, mobile and industrial hand tools end markets. Partially offsetting the weak North American demand was sales growth in the Asian market, primarily in the first half of 2008, as the rate of growth in the region slowed during the second half of the year.  

The segments niche businesses experienced a modest sales increase during 2008 as compared to 2007. Higher customer demand in the segments engine retarder business, which rebounded from the impact of regulatory changes that resulted in reduced 2007 sales levels, were largely offset by lower demand in the segments other niche businesses during year, with particularly lower demand in the fourth quarter.  

2007 COMPARED TO 2006  

Sales from existing businesses for 2007 reflect the impact of certain regulatory requirements that became effective at the beginning of 2007 which accelerated demand for the Companys engine retarder products in 2006 and adversely impacted demand in 2007. Price increases partially offset the decline in sales and contributed approximately 2.5% of sales growth compared to 2006. The impact of that price increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses.  

Operating profit margins for the segment were 13.1% in 2007 compared to 14.4% in 2006. Costs associated with workforce reductions and adjustments to production levels to match demand in the engine retarder business decreased operating profit margins by 85 basis in 2007 compared with 2006. Lower sales volumes in the mechanics hand tool business with Sears/K-Mart and increased lead costs in the wheel weight business also had a negative impact on the 2007 operating margins. In addition, operating profit margins were adversely impacted by 40 basis points as a result of expenses incurred in connection with a fire in one of the business manufacturing facilities in China and costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 to close one facility and reduce headcount.  

Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment  

Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 70% of segment sales in 2007, grew 1.0% in 2007 compared to 2006. The segments Matco business grew slightly during 2007 as the business benefited from recent product introductions and price increases which offset declines in distributor average purchase levels during 2007. The retail hand tool business experienced strength in China and in its export business to Europe, as well as certain of its retail channels. This performance, in large part, was offset by a decline in sales to Sears/K-Mart, the retail hand tools business largest customer. Year-over-year softness in same-store sales of hand tools at Sears/K-Mart also adversely impacted the business.  

The segments niche businesses experienced mid-single digit sales declines during 2007 as compared to 2006. The impact of the regulatory issue noted above was partially offset by improved sales performance in the segments wheel service business during 2007 driven by price increases necessary to recover increased lead costs.

GROSS PROFIT  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2008 increased 110 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 gross profit margins is $33 million (25 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. The increase in gross profit margins over 2007 is primarily a result of leverage on increased sales volume, particularly in higher-margin consumable oriented businesses, the impact of cost-saving initiatives that began in late 2007 and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, primarily Tektronix. The impact on gross margins of higher commodity costs prevalent through the majority of 2008 was partially mitigated by price increases implemented throughout the Company. These higher commodity costs have declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and, assuming the costs remain at the current levels, will provide a benefit to the Company in 2009 assuming sales volumes similar to those experienced by the Company during 2008.  

The increase in gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from leverage on increased sales volume, the on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our Danaher Business System processes and low-cost region initiatives and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired and increases in selling prices. Gross profit margins also improved due to lower-margin sales to USPS in the product identification business comprising a smaller proportion of sales during 2007 compared to 2006. The gross margins for 2007 also benefited from the inclusion of a full year of results from higher-margin Sybron business as compared to 2006 which only included seven months of Sybron results as a result of Sybron acquisition in May 2006. The improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs incurred in 2007 for which full recovery in the form of price increases dilutes reported margins.  

OPERATING EXPENSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2008 increased 170 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 selling, general and administrative expenses is $49 million (40 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. Other increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily associated with recently acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. Increased spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, particularly in emerging markets, also contributed to the growth as a percentage of sales.  

41  

Table of Contents 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points during 2007 as compared to 2006 levels. The year-over-year increases resulted from recently acquired businesses (principally Sybron Dental and Vision) which generally have higher operating expense structures, compared to the Companys other businesses, as well as increased investment in sales forces in emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by operating leverage from higher sales during 2007 as compared to 2006. In addition, the recovery of certain previously written-off indemnity receivable balances during 2007 favorably impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.  

Research and development expenses, consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs, as a percentage of sales were approximately 20 basis points higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2007 charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition, as described below, impacted year-over-year comparisons by 75 basis points. The relatively higher research and development cost structures of recently acquired businesses, primarily Tektronix, and higher investment in research and development in the Medical Technologies segment were the primary drivers of these year-over-year increases. The Company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses.  

Research and development expenses were approximately 90 basis points higher in 2007 as compared to 2006. In 2007, the Company expensed approximately $60.4 million of in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition as compared to approximately $6.5 million of in-process research and development expensed in 2006 related to the Vision acquisition. Newly acquired companies and their higher, relative research and development cost structures also contributed to the year-over-year increase.  

INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS  

For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financing Activities and Indebtedness below.  

Interest expense of $130 million in 2008 was approximately $20 million higher than 2007 as a result of higher average debt levels during 2008, primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter 2007 to fund the acquisition of Tektronix. Interest expense of $110 million in 2007 was approximately $30 million higher than 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during 2007, due to borrowings incurred to fund the 2007 acquisitions of Tektronix and ChemTreat and the 2006 acquisitions of Sybron and Vision.  

Interest income of $10 million, $6 million and $8 million was recognized in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income during 2008 was higher than during 2007 as a result of higher average invested cash balances as less cash was employed in acquisitions during 2008. Interest income in 2007 was lower than 2006 as average invested cash balances were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in late 2006 and throughout 2007 as well as to repurchase shares of Company common stock in 2007. In addition, lower interest rates prevailing during 2007 contributed to the decrease in interest income.  

INCOME TAXES  

General  

The Companys effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur. The Companys effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such   

42  

Table of Contents 

 earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2008, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.3 billion.  

The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Companys estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the amount of earnings and/or deductions realized in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates may differ from current estimates.  

Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate  

The Companys effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 24.7%, 25.8% and 22.4%, respectively.  

The Companys 2008 effective tax rate of 24.7% includes the impact of approximately $9.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and discrete items recorded primarily during the second quarter. In addition, the effective tax rate reflects a full year benefit of approximately $10 million from research and experimentation credits which were reinstated with the enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the continued growth in earnings outside of the United States. Refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  

The Companys 2007 effective tax rate from continuing operations of 25.8% reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately $21 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. New tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007, most notably in Germany and Denmark, reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the Companys deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions, such that the Companys effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation. Partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction, net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with Sweden.  

The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be approximately 26%.  

INFLATION  

Market forces during the first nine months of 2008 resulted in generally higher average costs for raw materials, with prices of many raw materials reaching historic price levels early in the third quarter. These costs generally declined after reaching these historic levels. The Company passed along certain of these cost increases to its customers. The raw materials purchased at record high price levels have largely been consumed in the production process.  

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  

43  

Table of Contents 

Interest Rate Risk  

The Companys short-term debt obligations relate primarily to commercial paper borrowings. Refer to Note 8 for information regarding the Companys outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2008. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect the Companys results of operations. In 2008, a 100 percent increase in average market interest rates on the Companys commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Companys interest expense by approximately $29 million. A 100 percent hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Companys actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2008.  

Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt, excluding the LYONs, would decrease by approximately $65 million (the LYONs have not been included in this calculation as the value of the convertible debt is primarily derived from the LYONs conversion feature). The Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and therefore, with respect to the fixed-rate long-term debt, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the Companys results of operations or stockholders equity.  

In connection with the maturity and repayment of the Companys $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes in October 2008, the Companys two associated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million matured. The swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and qualified as effective or perfect hedges.  

Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

Exchange rate risk arises from the Companys investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries, as well as from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Companys net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Eurobonds, is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2008 (net of the translation effect of the Companys Eurobond Notes, discussed below) would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately $396 million.  

In addition, although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies. Sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. 

The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Eurobond Notes described below (which as of December 31, 2008 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to $699 million) and the Euro-denominated portion of the Companys commercial paper program (which as of December 31, 2008 had no outstanding borrowings), provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position.  

In the fourth quarter of 2008, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts related to anticipated sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiaries entering the contracts. The forward contracts, having an aggregate notional amount of 3.4 billion Japanese Yen ($37.5 million) related to one subsidiary and an aggregate notional amount of 14.5 million Euro ($20.3 million) related to the second subsidiary, will be settled at various dates during the year ending December 31, 2009 in   

44  

Table of Contents 

 accordance with their terms. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these forward contracts as cash flow hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts was approximately $2 million.  

Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.  

In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Companys customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. Notwithstanding these efforts, the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Management assesses the Companys liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities.  

Although recent distress in the financial markets and the global economy in general has not had a significant impact on the Companys liquidity as of the filing date of this Report, management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions. The capital markets worldwide, including the United States, have been severely impacted by credit losses, asset write-downs and failures of some financial institutions. This disruption has impacted credit spreads and pricing on new securities issuances. The Companys credit facility is predominately with institutions that, to date, appear to be relatively unaffected by the disruption. The Companys ability to access the commercial paper market has also not, to date, been affected adversely by the capital markets disruption. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity, primarily its commercial paper program and committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. For a discussion of risks related to the distress in the financial markets and the global economy in general, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Companys liquidity, increased $160 million during 2008, or approximately 9.5%, as compared to 2007.  

       Debt repayments constituted the most significant use of cash during 2008. The Company repaid approximately $1.1 billion of debt, net of new borrowings during this period.  

46  

Table of Contents 

       The Company acquired seventeen businesses during 2008. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8.5 million of debt assumed.  

       As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $393 million of cash and cash equivalents.  

Operating Activities  

The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows.  

Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Companys liquidity, was approximately $1.9 billion for 2008, an increase of $160 million, or approximately 9.5% as compared to 2007. Earnings growth of $104 million in addition to an increase of approximately $39 million in contributions from operating working capital (which the Company defines as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) as compared to 2007 contributed to the overall year-over-year increase in operating cash flows. The 2008 operating working capital contribution increased primarily due to strong collections of accounts receivable. Operating cash flows during 2008 also benefited approximately $83 million from year-over-year increases in stock compensation, depreciation and amortization charges which do not require the use of cash. In addition, non-cash acquisition related charges incurred related to acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the 2007 acquisition of Tektronix had a positive impact on operating cash flow comparisons. Approximately $100 million of additional income tax payments made in 2008 related to continuing operations as compared to 2007 partially offset these positive factors.  

Investing Activities  

Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was $567 million during 2008 compared to $3.4 billion of net cash used in the comparable period of 2007. Gross capital spending increased $32 million from $162 million during 2007 to $194 million during 2008, due primarily to capital spending relating to newly acquired businesses and increased spending related to investments in the Companys low-cost region sourcing initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In 2009, the Company expects capital spending to exceed $200 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.  

Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was $3.4 billion in 2007 compared to approximately $2.8 billion in 2006. Gross capital spending increased $26 million in 2007 from 2006 levels to $162 million.  

As discussed below, the Company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2008, 2007 and 2006. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

2008 Acquisitions  

The Company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8.5 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures instrumentation and/or supply products in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These companies were acquired to complement   

47  

Table of Contents 

 existing units of the Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies or Professional Instrumentation segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million.  

2007 Acquisitions and Divestiture  

In November 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. The Company initially financed the acquisition of Tektronix through the issuance of commercial paper and available cash (including proceeds from the underwritten public offering of 6.9 million shares of Danaher common stock completed on November 2, 2007). Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company issued $500 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 in an underwritten public offering and used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the Tektronix acquisition.  

In July 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTreat for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs. No cash was acquired in the transaction. The Company financed the acquisition primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash.  

In addition, the Company acquired ten other companies or product lines during 2007 for consideration of approximately $273 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired, and $4 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures instrumentation and/or supply products in the test and measurement, dental technologies, product identification, sensors and controls or environmental instruments markets. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $123 million.  

In addition to the ten acquisitions noted above, as discussed below, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Vision not owned by the Company as of December 31, 2006 for cash consideration of approximately $96 million.  

In July 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business generating approximately $275 million of net cash proceeds. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment and designs and manufactures power quality and reliability products and services, had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $130 million in 2006. The Company used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes, including debt reduction and acquisitions.  

2006 Acquisitions  

In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron for total cash consideration of approximately $2 billion, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Sybron is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of products for the dental professional and had revenues of approximately $650 million in its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. Substantially all of the assumed debt was repaid or refinanced prior to December 31, 2006. Danaher financed the acquisition of shares and the refinancing of the assumed debt primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash.  

In addition, in the last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $525 million, including transaction costs and net of $113 million of cash acquired and assumed $1.5 million of debt. Of this purchase price, $96 million was paid during 2007 to acquire the remaining shares of Vision that the Company did not own as of December 31, 2006 and for transaction costs. The Company financed the transaction through a combination of available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy-based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of $86 million in its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. The pairing of Vision with the Companys existing

 life science instrumentation business, Leica, has significantly broadened the Companys product offerings in the anatomical pathology market and has expanded the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses. The Company believes that the pairing of Leica and Vision also created a broader base for the potential acquisition of complementary businesses in the life sciences industry.  

Total consideration for the other nine businesses acquired during 2006 was approximately $213 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each manufactures instrumentation and/or supply products in the test and measurement, acute care diagnostics, water quality, product identification or sensors and controls markets. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual revenues of these nine acquired businesses, at the date of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $140 million.  

In the first half of 2006, the Company purchased and subsequently sold shares of First Technology plc, a U.K.based public company, in connection with the Companys unsuccessful bid to acquire First Technology. First Technology also paid the Company a break-up fee of approximately $3 million. During the second quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 million ($8.9 million after-tax, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share) in connection with these matters, net of related transaction costs, which is included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings.  

Financing Activities and Indebtedness  

Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of $1.1 billion during 2008 compared to $1.7 billion of cash provided during 2007. The year-over-year change was primarily due to repayment of a substantial portion of the commercial paper indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions of Tektronix and ChemTreat in 2007; the repurchase of shares of Danaher common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program; repayment of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 (net of commercial paper issued to refinance such repayment); and dividends paid during 2008.  

Total debt was $2,619 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $3,726 million at December 31, 2007. The Companys debt as of December 31, 2008 was as follows:  

       $624 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper;  

       $699 million (500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (Eurobond Notes);  

       $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 (2018 Notes);  

       $620 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (LYONs); and  

       $176 million of other borrowings.  

The Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except in connection with the change of control triggers described as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes and the 2018 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of 2018 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. The Companys outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Companys operations and as of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility  

The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Companys U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the Credit Facility (described below) provides credit support for the program, the $1.45 billion of availability under the Credit Facility has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $1.45 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions. The Company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.  

Credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which expires on April 25, 2012. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on, at the Companys option, (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, or (2) a formula based on Bank of Americas prime rate or on the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders equity) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. The availability of the Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program. We expect to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facility to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures.  

During 2008, the Company utilized its commercial paper program to finance the repayment of the 6.1% notes due 2008. During 2007, the Company utilized its commercial paper program (as well as operating cash flow and the proceeds from the November 2007 common stock offering and December 2007 offering of the 2018 Notes), to fund the acquisitions of ChemTreat and Tektronix. As of December 31, 2008, $624 million was outstanding under the Companys U.S. dollar commercial paper program with a weighted average interest rate of 1.0% and an average maturity of approximately 13 days. As of December 31, 2008, there was no outstanding Euro-denominated commercial paper.  

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Companys ability to issue commercial paper. We have not experienced difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available operating cash flow and our Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our Credit Facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.  

In connection with the financing of the Tektronix acquisition in November 2007, the Company entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured revolving bridge loan facility (the Bridge Facility), which provided additional credit support for the commercial paper program and was also available for working capital and other corporate purposes. In December 2007, Danaher reduced the amount of the Bridge Facility to $1.0 billion to minimize maintenance costs, and in May 2008 Danaher further reduced the facility to $0.5 billion. The Bridge Facility expired on November 11, 2008. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Bridge Facility during 2008.  

Other Long-Term Indebtedness  

In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were   

50  

Table of Contents 

 approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points.  

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed.  

In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2008, an aggregate of approximately 68,000 shares of Danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2008, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.  

Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1.4 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2008. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.  

The $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 matured October 15, 2008 and were repaid from the proceeds of commercial paper borrowings.  

Shelf Registration Statement and Common Stock Offering  

The Company has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance.  

In November 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6.9 million shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $82.25 per share off the shelf registration statement. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $550 million, which were used to partially fund the acquisition of Tektronix. In December 2007, the Company also issued the 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 off the shelf registration statement.  

Stock Repurchase Program  

On April 21, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Companys common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no   

51  

Table of Contents 

 expiration date for the Companys repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys equity compensation plans and for other corporate purposes.  

During 2008, the Company repurchased 1.38 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $74 million. During 2007, the Company repurchased 1.64 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $117 million. The 2008 and 2007 repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately 2 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Companys available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.  

Dividends  

The Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share that was paid on January 30, 2009 to holders of record on December 26, 2008. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2008 were $38 million.  

Cash and Cash Requirements  

The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing commercial paper programs or the Credit Facility or, subject to availability, access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. Subject to market conditions and managements judgment, the Company intends to seek to publicly issue debt securities prior to the end of the first quarter of 2009, the proceeds of which would be used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and/or for other general, corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $393 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. Of this amount, approximately $373 million was held outside the United States; repatriation of these amounts is either restricted or prohibited by local laws and/or would potentially trigger United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits, as discussed below.  

The Companys cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Companys operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intra-company transfer of funds, the Companys intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.  

The provisions of the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in August 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the Companys U.S. pension plan beginning in 2009. During 2009, the Companys cash contribution requirements for its U.S. pension plan are not expected to be significant. Funding requirements for the U.S. pension may become more significant commencing in the year ended December 31, 2010; however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, underlying asset returns and the impact of recent legislative activity associated with pension funding obligations. Cash contributions during 2009 related to the Companys non-U.S. pension plans are expected to be approximately $30 million.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities.  

In connection with five acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price. The Company enters into these types of arrangements to help bridge differences of opinion that the Company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business. The Company could pay nothing in the aggregate pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $72.4 million over the next 15 years depending on the performance of the respective businesses during the specified performance period.  

Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

Due to the Companys downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danahers Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher intends to execute with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement with Danaher which will provide for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher will agree to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.

Except as described above, as of December 31, 2008 the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no unconsolidated special purpose entities.  

Legal Proceedings  

Please refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters.  

In addition to the litigation matters noted under Item 1. Business  Regulatory Matters  Environmental, Health & Safety, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, aviation, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. Based upon the Companys experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.  

The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. For general liability risk (which includes product liability) and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (stop loss insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of outside risk insurance professionals for product liability. In addition, outside risk insurances professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Companys specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers for claims paid associated with these risks, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2008 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings. Please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability.  

For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

55  

Table of Contents 

The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Companys customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. Recent deterioration in overall global economic conditions and worldwide credit markets heightens the uncertainties related to customers ability to pay and may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.  

Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.  

Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using various valuation techniques with the initial estimate being calculated using a market based approach where fair value is estimated based on EBITDA multiples determined by available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the precedent transaction EBITDA multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including recent operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. To the extent the fair value as estimated by the market based approach exceeds the carrying value of a reporting unit by less than 30%, management performs an analysis using the income approach to estimate fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis related to that reporting unit. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.  

The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis, as described above, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Companys reporting units as of the first day of the Companys fiscal fourth quarter, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately 1.4% to approximately 421%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the   

56  

Table of Contents 

 respective reporting unit) from this hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value ranged from a short fall of approximately 9% to an excess of approximately 369% for each of the Companys reporting units. The carrying value of the Companys individual reporting units ranges from approximately $13 million to approximately $2.5 billion.  

Long-lived assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Companys long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.  

Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF No. 95-3), the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Companys experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired companys business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the restructuring plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to restructure the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, that became effective January 1, 2009, the provisions of EITF 95-3 will not be applicable to acquisitions completed subsequent to January 1, 2009. Acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008 will continue to apply the provisions of EITF 95-3. Refer to New Accounting Standards below for additional information.  

Environmental. The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. We also estimate our exposure for probable environmental-related personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability. While the Company actively pursues insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable.  

The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Companys involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If the environmental reserves established by the Company are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.

Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate, recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and, if applicable, other professionals. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Companys settlement strategy. For a discussion of these contingencies, including managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.  

As discussed above under Legal Proceedings, the Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts for these liabilities and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. Please see Legal Proceedings for a discussion of how reserves are established for self-insurance and litigation liability. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2008 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.  

Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of professional, industrial, medical and consumer products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. The Companys standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company principally records revenue for product sale upon shipment. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale as required by SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price for the products purchased in accordance with EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of a Vendors Products). Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement as required by FASB Technical Bulletin 90-1, Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts.  

Revenues for contractual arrangements with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In the case of arrangements that include more than incidental software, the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions, are applied. Revenues are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exist (or in the case of software related products, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value) and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Companys control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements.  

Share-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options,   

58  

Table of Contents 

 RSUs and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, the Company recognizes equity-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.  

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Companys employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are provided health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company accounts for its pension and postretirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions; SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions; and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans is computed using actuarial valuations.  

Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations. These include assumptions the Company makes relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the Company. The assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For the United States plan, the Company used a 6.25% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2008, which represents an increase of 25 basis points in the discount rate from December 31, 2007. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. net obligation by $58 million ($38 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2008.  

For 2008, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8% which is the same as the rate used in 2007. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension benefit for the U.S. plan for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis), compared with pension expense of $13 million (or $8 million on an after-tax basis) for this plan in 2007. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2008 would have increased $6 million (or $4 million on an after-tax basis). The Company made no contributions to the U.S. plan in 2008. The Companys non-U.S. plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.5% to 8.25% for 2008 and ranged from 0.75% to 7.5% for 2007.  

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires a

 company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans over funded status or a liability for a plans under funded status; (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements were effective and adopted by the Company as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of the recognition provisions of the standard reduced the amount of pension and other post-retirement liabilities as of December 31, 2006 by approximately $23 million and increased stockholders equity by approximately $15.6 million due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over-funded positions in certain of the Companys non-US pension plans and due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Companys U.S. based retiree benefit program.  

The requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal yearend statement of financial position was effective and adopted by the Company as of the year ended December 31, 2008. Prior to adoption of the measurement date provisions, the majority of the Companys pension and postretirement plans used a September 30 measurement date. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 increased long-term liabilities by approximately $6 million and decreased stockholders equity by approximately $4 million. There was no effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows.  

The provisions of the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in August 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the Companys U.S. pension plan beginning in 2009. During 2009, the Companys cash contribution requirements for its U.S. pension plan are not expected to be significant. Funding requirements for the U.S. pension may become more significant commencing in the year ending December 31, 2010; however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, underlying asset returns and the impact of recent legislative activity associated with pension funding obligations. Cash contributions during 2009 related to the Companys non-U.S. pension plans are expected to be approximately $30 million.  

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 160 clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in the financial statements and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and impacts the accounting for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R will likely have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations, however, the magnitude of that impact is dependent on the frequency and relative size of the acquisitions completed by the Company. In general, more frequent acquisition activity and relatively larger acquisitions will have a more significant impact. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations is not expected to be significant.  

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair

 value. Under SFAS No. 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, such as debt issuance costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation, the Company recognized a decrease of $63 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.
