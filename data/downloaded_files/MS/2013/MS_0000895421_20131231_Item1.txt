This activity is undertaken through the Companys own facilities, through membership in various clearing and settlement organizations, and through agreements with unaffiliated third parties.  

Competition.  

All aspects of the Companys businesses are highly competitive, and the Company expects them to remain so. The Company competes in the U.S. and globally for clients, market share and human talent in all aspects of its business segments. The Companys competitive position depends on its reputation and the quality and consistency of its long-term investment performance. The Companys ability to sustain or improve its competitive position also depends substantially on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs. The Company competes with commercial banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the U.S., globally and through the internet. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses, been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. Such changes could result in the Companys remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge. See also Supervision and Regulation below and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A herein.  

Institutional Securities and Wealth Management.  

The Companys competitive position for its Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments depends on innovation, execution capability and relative pricing. The Company competes directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers and with others on a regional or product basis.  

      6    

Table of Contents 

The Companys ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is generally impacted by the Companys credit ratings) and to commit capital efficiently, particularly in its capital-intensive underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects its competitive position. Corporate clients may request that the Company provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities and such requests are expected to increase in the future.  

It is possible that competition may become even more intense as the Company continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain areas. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure in its businesses. The complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require effective resource allocation in order for the Company to remain competitive. In addition, the Companys business is subject to increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad, while certain of its competitors may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than the Company, thereby putting the Company at a competitive disadvantage.  

The Company has experienced intense price competition in some of its businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute securities trades electronically on exchanges and through other automated trading markets has increased the pressure on trading commissions and comparable fees. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely increase as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms. It is possible that the Company will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of its competitors may seek to obtain market share by reducing prices (in the form of commissions or pricing).  

Investment Management.  

Competition in the asset management industry is affected by several factors, including the Companys reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment strategies or product offerings relative to peers and an appropriate benchmark index, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels and investment pipelines, and the types and quality of products offered. The Companys alternative investment products, such as private equity funds, real estate and hedge funds, compete with similar products offered by both alternative and traditional asset managers, who may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than the Company.  

Supervision and Regulation.  

As a major financial services firm, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where it conducts its business. Moreover, in response to the 20072008 financial crisis, legislators and regulators, both in the U.S. and worldwide, are in the process of adopting, finalizing and implementing a wide range of reforms that will result in major changes to the way the Company is regulated and conducts its business. It will take time for the comprehensive effects of these reforms to emerge and be understood.  

Regulatory Outlook.  

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010. While certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately, most other portions are effective following transition periods or through numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies, and although a large number of rules have been proposed, many are still subject to final rulemaking or transition periods. U.S. regulators also plan to propose additional regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, it remains difficult to assess fully the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on the Company and on the financial services industry generally. In addition, various  

    7      

Table of Contents 

 international developments, such as the adoption of or further revisions to risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee), including Basel III, and the implementation of those standards in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, will continue to impact the Company in the coming years.  

It is likely that 2014 and subsequent years will see further material changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which the Company operates, although it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these changes will have on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period.  

Financial Holding Company.  

Consolidated Supervision.  

The Company has operated as a bank holding company and financial holding company under the BHC Act since September 2008. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve also gained heightened authority to examine, prescribe regulations and take action with respect to all of the Companys subsidiaries. In particular, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is, or will become, subject to (among other things) significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision, to more intensive scrutiny of its businesses and plans for expansion of those businesses, to new activities limitations, to a systemic risk regime that will impose heightened capital and liquidity requirements, to new restrictions on activities and investments imposed by a section of the BHC Act added by the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the Volcker Rule and to comprehensive new derivatives regulation. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has primary rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority over the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer protection laws, to the extent applicable.  

Scope of Permitted Activities. The BHC Act places limits on the activities of bank holding companies and financial holding companies, and grants the Federal Reserve authority to limit the Companys ability to conduct activities. The Company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally. Since becoming a bank holding company in September 2008, the Company has disposed of certain nonconforming assets and conformed certain activities to the requirements of the BHC Act.  

In addition, the Company continues to engage in discussions with the Federal Reserve regarding its commodities activities, as the BHC Act also grandfathers activities related to the trading, sale or investment in commodities and underlying physical properties, provided that the Company was engaged in any of such activities as of September 30, 1997 in the United States and provided that certain other conditions that are within the Companys reasonable control are satisfied. If the Federal Reserve were to determine that any of the Companys commodities activities did not qualify for the BHC Act grandfather exemption, then the Company would likely be required to divest any such activities that did not otherwise conform to the BHC Act. At this time, the Company believes, based on its interpretation of applicable law, that (i) such commodities activities qualify for the BHC Act grandfather exemption or otherwise conform to the BHC Act and (ii) if the Federal Reserve were to determine otherwise, any required divestment would not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. In January 2014, the Federal Reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which seeks public comment on certain matters related to financial holding companies physical commodity activities and merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies.  

Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule. In December 2013, U.S. regulators issued final regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule will, over time, prohibit banking entities, including the Company and its affiliates, from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market making-related activities, risk mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule will also require banking entities to either restructure or unwind  

      8    

Table of Contents 

 certain investments and relationships with covered funds, as defined in the Volcker Rule. Banking entities have until July 21, 2015 to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule, subject to possible extensions. The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with restrictions under the Volcker Rule.  

The Company is continuing its review of activities that may be affected by the Volcker Rule, including its trading operations and asset management activities, and is taking steps to establish the necessary compliance programs to comply with the Volcker Rule. The Company had already taken certain steps to comply with the Volcker Rule prior to the issuance of final regulations, including, for example, the divestiture of its in-house proprietary quantitative trading unit in January 2013. Given the complexity of the new framework, the full impact of the Volcker Rule is still uncertain, and will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight.  

Capital and Liquidity Standards. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company and evaluates its compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Companys Subsidiary Banks. Under existing capital regulations, for the Company to remain a financial holding company, its Subsidiary Banks must qualify as well-capitalized by maintaining a total risk-based capital ratio (total capital to risk-weighted assets) of at least 10% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%. To maintain its status as a financial holding company, the Company is also required to be well-capitalized by maintaining these capital ratios. Effective January 1, 2015, the well-capitalized standard for the Companys Subsidiary Banks will be revised to reflect the higher capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rule, as defined below. The Federal Reserve may require the Company and its peer financial holding companies to maintain risk and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financial holding companys particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. In addition, under the Federal Reserve and OCCs leverage capital rules, the Company and the Subsidiary Banks are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 4%.  

As of December 31, 2013, the Company calculated its capital ratios and risk-weighted assets in accordance with the existing capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve. These existing capital standards are based upon a framework described in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I. In December 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published final regulations incorporating the Basel II Accord, which requires internationally active U.S. banking organizations, as well as certain of their U.S. bank subsidiaries, to implement Basel II standards over the next several years. On January 1, 2013, the U.S. banking regulators rules to implement the Basel Committees market risk capital framework, referred to as Basel 2.5, became effective, which increased the capital requirements for securitizations and correlation trading within the Companys trading book, as well as incorporated add-ons for stressed Value-at-Risk and incremental risk requirements.  

In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on Basel III. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators promulgated final rules to implement many aspects of Basel III (the U.S. Basel III final rule). The Company became subject to the U.S. Basel III final rule on January 1, 2014. Certain requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rule, including the minimum risk-based capital ratios and new capital buffers, will commence or be phased in over several years.  

The U.S. Basel III final rule contains new capital standards that raise capital requirements, strengthen counterparty credit risk capital requirements, introduce a leverage ratio as a supplemental measure to the risk-based ratio and replace the use of externally developed credit ratings with alternatives such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments country risk classifications. Under the U.S. Basel III final rule, the Company is subject, on a fully phased-in basis, to a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8%.  

    9      

Table of Contents 

 The Company is also subject to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer and, if deployed, up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical buffer, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019. Failure to maintain such buffers will result in restrictions on the Companys ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. In addition, certain new items will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital and certain existing deductions will be modified. The majority of these capital deductions is subject to a phase-in schedule and will be fully phased in by 2018. Under the U.S. Basel III final rule, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities will be reflected in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to a phase-in schedule.  

U.S. banking regulators have published final regulations implementing a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring that certain institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, including the Company, be subject to minimum capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. Currently, this minimum capital floor is based on Basel I. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the U.S. Basel III final rule will replace the current Basel I-based capital floor with a standardized approach that, among other things, modifies the existing risk weights for certain types of asset classes. The capital floor applies to the calculation of minimum risk-based capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer and, if deployed, the countercyclical capital buffer.  

On February 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve and the OCC approved the Companys and the Subsidiary Banks respective use of the U.S. Basel III advanced internal ratings-based approach for determining credit risk capital requirements and advanced measurement approaches for determining operational risk capital requirements (collectively, the advanced approaches method) to calculate and publicly disclose their risk-based capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014, subject to the capital floor discussed above. One of the stipulations for this approval is that the Company will be required to satisfy certain conditions, as agreed to with the regulators, regarding the modeling used to determine its estimated risk-weighted assets associated with operational risk.  

In addition to the U.S. Basel III final rule, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to establish more stringent capital requirements for certain bank holding companies, including the Company. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to address this requirement by implementing the Basel Committees capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has provisionally identified the G-SIBs and assigned each G-SIB a Common Equity Tier 1 capital surcharge ranging from 1.0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Company is provisionally assigned a G-SIB capital surcharge of 1.5%. The FSB has stated that it intends to update the list of G-SIBs annually.  

The U.S. Basel III final rule also subjects certain banking organizations, including the Company, to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3% beginning on January 1, 2018. In January 2014, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the denominator of the Basel III leverage ratio. The revised denominator differs from the supplementary leverage ratio in the treatment of, among other things, derivatives, securities financing transactions and other off-balance sheet items. U.S. banking regulators may issue regulations to implement the revised Basel III leverage ratio.  

The U.S. banking regulators have also proposed a rule to implement enhanced supplementary leverage standards for certain large bank holding companies and their subsidiary insured depository institutions, including the Company and the Subsidiary Banks. Under this proposal, a covered bank holding company would need to maintain a leverage buffer of Tier 1 capital of greater than 2% in addition to the 3% minimum (for a total of greater than 5%), in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. This proposal would further establish a well-capitalized threshold based on a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% for insured depository institution subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Banks. If this proposal is adopted, its requirements would become effective on January 1, 2018 with public disclosure of the ratio required beginning in 2015.

The Basel Committee has developed two standards intended for use in liquidity risk supervision, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR was developed to ensure banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days. This standards objective is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks and bank holding companies. The NSFR has a time horizon of one year and is defined as the ratio of the amount of available stable funding to the amount of required stable funding. This standards objective is to promote resilience over a longer time horizon. In January 2014, the Basel Committee proposed revisions to the original December 2010 version of the NSFR and continues to contemplate the introduction of the NSFR, including any final revisions, as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.  

In October 2013, the U.S. banking regulators proposed a rule to implement the LCR in the U.S. (U.S. LCR proposal). The U.S. LCR proposal would apply to the Company and the Subsidiary Banks. The U.S. LCR proposal is more stringent in certain respects compared to the Basel Committees version of the LCR, and includes a generally narrower definition of high-quality liquid assets, a different methodology for calculating net cash outflows during the 30-day stress period as well as a shorter, two-year phase-in period that ends on December 31, 2016. The Federal Reserve has also indicated that it may implement regulatory measures related to short-term wholesale funding.  

See also Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationLiquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory Requirements in Part II, Item 7 herein.  

Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including the Company, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. Under the Federal Reserves capital plan final rule, the Company must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Company and the Federal Reserve.  

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases), and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact the bank holding companys consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how the bank holding company will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the minimum ratios under the U.S. Basel III final rule that are phased in over the planning horizon, and above a Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio of 5%, and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions under supervisory stress scenarios. The capital plan final rule requires that such companies receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. In addition to capital planning requirements, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Company and the Subsidiary Banks, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. All of these policies and other requirements could influence the Companys ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, or require it to provide capital assistance to the Subsidiary Banks under circumstances which the Company would not otherwise decide to do so.  

The Company expects that, by March 31, 2014, the Federal Reserve will either object or provide a notice of non-objection to the Companys 2014 capital plan that was submitted to the Federal Reserve on January 6, 2014.  

In October 2012, the Federal Reserve issued its stress test final rule as required by the Dodd-Frank Act that requires the Company to conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests. Under this rule, the Company is required to publicly disclose the summary results of its company-run stress tests under the severely adverse economic  

    11      

Table of Contents 

 scenario. The rule also subjects the Company to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The capital planning and stress testing requirements for large bank holding companies form part of the Federal Reserves annual CCAR process.  

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of the Subsidiary Banks to conduct an annual stress test, although MSPNA was given an exemption by the OCC for the 2014 stress test. MSBNA submitted its 2014 annual company-run stress tests to the OCC and the Federal Reserve on January 6, 2014.  

See also Capital and Liquidity Standards above and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationLiquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory Requirements in Part II, Item 7 herein.  

Systemic Risk Regime. The Dodd-Frank Act established a regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions deemed to pose systemic risks. Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, such as the Company, became automatically subject to the systemic risk regime in July 2010. A new oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council), can recommend prudential standards, reporting and disclosure requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions, must approve any finding by the Federal Reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions. The Council is also empowered to designate systemically important payment, clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions, subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation and, assisted by the new Office of Financial Research within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) (established by the Dodd-Frank Act), can gather data and reports from financial institutions, including the Company.  

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company must also provide to the Federal Reserve and FDIC, and MSBNA must provide to the FDIC, an annual plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress. The Company and MSBNA submitted their most recent annual resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, as required, on October 1, 2013.  

In February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued final rules to implement certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Acts systemic risk regime. Effective on January 1, 2015, the final rules will require bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, to conduct internal liquidity stress tests, maintain unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows for 30 days over the range of liquidity stress scenarios used in internal stress tests, and comply with various liquidity risk management requirements. In addition, the final rules will require institutions to comply with a range of risk management and corporate governance requirements, such as establishment of a risk committee of the board of directors and appointment of a chief risk officer, both of which the Company already has. Under the final rules, upon a grave threat determination by the Council, the Federal Reserve must require financial institutions subject to the systemic risk regime to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15-to-1 if the Council considers it necessary to mitigate the risk.  

The systemic risk regime provides that, for institutions posing a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, the Federal Reserve, upon Council vote, must limit that institutions ability to merge, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate activities, impose conditions on activities or, as a last resort, require it to dispose of assets. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish further standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed rules that would limit the aggregate exposure of each bank holding company with $500 billion or more in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, and each company designated by the Council, to each other such institution to 10% of the aggregate capital and surplus of each institution, and limit the aggregate exposure of such institutions to any other unaffiliated counterparty to 25% of the institutions aggregate capital and surplus. The proposed rules would also create a new early remediation  

      12

 framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses determined with reference to four levels of early remediation, including heightened supervisory review, initial remediation, recovery, and resolution assessment, with specific limitations and requirements tied to each level. The Federal Reserve has stated that it will issue, at a later date, final rules establishing single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework.  

See also Capital and Liquidity Standards above and Orderly Liquidation Authority below.  

Orderly Liquidation Authority. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding companies such as the Company and certain covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to resolution under a new orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the U.S., must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by two-thirds of the FDIC Board and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board. Absent such actions, the Company as a bank holding company would remain subject to resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  

The orderly liquidation authority went into effect in July 2010, and rulemaking is proceeding in stages, with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed. If the Company were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Company, including (i) the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the Companys failure and to appoint new directors and officers; (ii) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (iii) the ability to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (iv) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution. In December 2013, the FDIC released its proposed single point of entry strategy for resolution of a systemically important financial institution under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDICs release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a systemically important financial institution by placing its top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company, recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it may also introduce a requirement that certain large bank holding companies maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt at the holding company level to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms.  

U.S. Subsidiary Banks.  

U.S. Banking Institutions. MSBNA, primarily a wholesale commercial bank, offers retail securities-based lending and commercial lending services in addition to deposit products. Certain foreign exchange activities are also conducted in MSBNA. As an FDIC-insured national bank, MSBNA is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC.  

MSPNA offers certain mortgage and other secured lending products primarily for customers of its affiliate retail broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (MSSB LLC). MSPNA also offers certain deposit products, as well as prime brokerage custody services. MSPNA is an FDIC-insured national bank whose activities are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC.  

Effective October 1, 2013, the lending limits applicable to the Companys U.S. Subsidiary Banks were revised to take into account credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities lending, securities borrowing and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with third parties.  

In January 2014, the OCC proposed a set of specific risk governance guidelines to formalize its heightened expectations for large national banks, including MSBNA. The proposed guidelines set minimum standards for  

    13      

Table of Contents 

 the design and implementation of a banks risk governance framework and the oversight of that framework by a banks board of directors.  

Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by their federal banking regulators. Among other things, it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action (PCA) with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Current PCA regulations generally apply only to insured banks and thrifts such as MSBNA or MSPNA and not to their parent holding companies. The Federal Reserve is, however, subject to limitations, authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level. In addition, as described above, under the systemic risk regime, the Company will become subject to an early remediation protocol in the event of financial distress. The Dodd-Frank Act also formalized the requirement that bank holding companies, such the Company, serve as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and commit resources to support these subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries are in financial distress.  

Transactions with Affiliates. The Companys U.S. bank subsidiaries are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on any extensions of credit to, purchase of assets from, and certain other transactions with, any affiliates. These restrictions limit the total amount of credit exposure that they may have to any one affiliate and to all affiliates, as well as collateral requirements, and they require all such transactions to be made on market terms. Effective July 2012, derivatives, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions between the Companys U.S. bank subsidiaries and their affiliates became subject to these restrictions. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will propose rulemaking to implement these restrictions. These reforms will place limits on the Companys U.S. bank subsidiaries ability to engage in derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions with other affiliates of the Company.  

In addition, the Volcker Rule generally prohibits covered transactions, such as extensions of credit, between (i) the Company or any of its affiliates and (ii) covered funds for which the Company or any of its affiliates serve as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or sponsor and other covered funds organized and offered pursuant to specific exemptions in the Volcker Rule.  

FDIC Regulation. An FDICinsured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an insured depository institution under common control by the same bank holding company. As FDIC-insured depository institutions, MSBNA and MSPNA are exposed to each others losses. In addition, both institutions are exposed to changes in the cost of FDIC insurance. In 2010, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to replenish the reserve fund over a multi-year period. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, some of the restoration must be paid for exclusively by large depository institutions, including MSBNA, and FDIC deposit insurance assessments are calculated using a new methodology that generally favors banks that are mostly funded by deposits.  

Institutional Securities and Wealth Management.  

Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation. The Companys primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, MS&Co. and MSSB LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are members of various self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and various securities exchanges and clearing organizations. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers, representatives and other associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Violations of the laws and regulations governing a broker-dealers actions could result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar consequences by both federal and state securities administrators.  

      14    

Table of Contents 

In addition, MSSB LLC is a registered investment adviser with the SEC. MSSB LLCs relationship with its investment advisory clients is subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed on investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as well as various state securities laws. These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies with broad administrative powers to address non-compliance, including the power to restrict or limit MSSB LLC from carrying on its investment advisory and other asset management activities. Other sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines.  

The Dodd-Frank Act includes various provisions that affect the regulation of broker-dealer sales practices and customer relationships. For example, the SEC is authorized to adopt a fiduciary duty applicable to broker-dealers when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers. The U.S. Department of Labor is considering revisions to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that could subject broker-dealers to a fiduciary duty and prohibit specified transactions for a wider range of customer interactions. These developments may impact the manner in which affected businesses are conducted, decrease profitability and increase potential liabilities.  

Margin lending by broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserves restrictions on lending in connection with customer and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities. Broker-dealers are also subject to maintenance and other margin requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory organization rules. In many cases, the Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries margin policies are more stringent than these rules.  

As registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the SECs net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various exchanges, other regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Many non-U.S. regulatory authorities and exchanges also have rules relating to capital and, in some cases, liquidity requirements that apply to the Companys non-U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries. These rules are generally designed to measure general financial integrity and/or liquidity and require that at least a minimum amount of net and/or liquid assets be maintained by the subsidiary. See also Financial Holding CompanyConsolidated Supervision and Financial Holding CompanyCapital and Liquidity Standards above. Rules of FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations also impose limitations and requirements on the transfer of member organizations assets.  

Compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit the Companys operations requiring the intensive use of capital. Such requirements restrict the Companys ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer subsidiaries, which in turn may limit its ability to pay dividends, repay debt, or redeem or purchase shares of its own outstanding stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely affect the Companys ability to pay dividends or to expand or maintain present business levels. In addition, such rules may require the Company to make substantial capital infusions into one or more of its broker-dealer subsidiaries in order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules.  

MS&Co. and MSSB LLC are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for customers of broker-dealers against losses in the event of the insolvency of a broker-dealer. SIPC protects customers eligible securities held by a member broker-dealer up to $500,000 per customer for all accounts in the same capacity subject to a limitation of $250,000 for claims for uninvested cash balances. To supplement this SIPC coverage, each of MS&Co. and MSSB LLC have purchased additional protection for the benefit of their customers in the form of an annual policy issued by certain underwriters and various insurance companies that provides protection for each eligible customer above SIPC limits subject to an aggregate firmwide cap of $1 billion with no per client sublimit for securities and a $1.9 million per client limit for the cash portion of any remaining shortfall. As noted under Financial Holding CompanySystemic Risk Regime above, the Dodd-Frank Act contains special provisions for the orderly liquidation of covered financial  

    15      

Table of Contents 

 institutions (which could potentially include MS&Co. and/or MSSB LLC). While these provisions are generally intended to provide customers of covered broker-dealers with protections at least as beneficial as they would enjoy in a broker-dealer liquidation proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act, the details and implementation of such protections are subject to further rulemaking.  

The SEC adopted rules requiring broker-dealers to maintain risk management controls and supervisory procedures with respect to providing access to securities markets, which became fully effective in 2012. In July 2012, the SEC adopted a consolidated audit trail rule, which, when fully implemented, will require broker-dealers to report into one consolidated audit trail comprehensive information about every material event in the lifecycle of every quote, order, and execution in all exchange-listed stocks and options. It is possible that the SEC or self-regulatory organizations could propose or adopt additional market structure rules for equity and fixed income markets in the future. The provisions, new rules and proposals discussed above could result in increased costs and could otherwise adversely affect trading volumes and other conditions in the markets in which we operate.  

Regulation of Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities. As futures commission merchants, MS&Co. and MSSB LLC are subject to net capital requirements of, and their activities are regulated by, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC), the National Futures Association (the NFA), a registered futures association, and various commodity futures exchanges. MS&Co. and MSSB LLC and certain of their affiliates are registered members of the NFA in various capacities. Rules and regulations of the CFTC, NFA and commodity futures exchanges address obligations related to, among other things, the segregation of customer funds and the holding apart of a secured amount, the use by futures commission merchants of customer funds, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, risk disclosure, risk management and discretionary trading. MS&Co. and MSSB LLC have affiliates that are registered as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under certain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance. Under CFTC and NFA rules, commodity trading advisors who manage accounts and commodity pool operators that are registered with the NFA must distribute disclosure documents and maintain specified records relating to their activities, and commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators have certain responsibilities with respect to each pool they advise or operate. Violations of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity exchanges could result in remedial actions, including fines, registration restrictions or terminations, trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships.  

The Companys commodities activities are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety and other governmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. Intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by U.S. federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and by the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement and remedial proceedings involving energy companies, including those engaged in power generation and liquid hydrocarbons trading. Terminal facilities and other assets relating to the Companys commodities activities also are subject to environmental laws both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, pipeline, transport and terminal operations are subject to state laws in connection with the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal. See also Financial Holding CompanyScope of Permitted Activities above.  

Derivatives Regulation. Through the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company faces a comprehensive U.S. regulatory regime for its activities in certain OTC derivatives. The regulation of swaps and security-based swaps (collectively, Swaps) in the U.S. is being, and will continue to be, effected and implemented through the CFTC, SEC and other agency regulations. The CFTC has completed the majority of its regulations in this area, most of which are in effect. The SEC and other agencies charged with regulating Swaps have not yet adopted the majority of their Swap regulations.  

Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Dodd-Frank Act requires central clearing of certain types of Swaps, public and regulatory reporting, and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or execution facilities. Reporting requirements for CFTC-regulated Swaps are now in effect and certain types of CFTC-regulated interest rate and index credit default swaps are subject to mandatory central clearing. Certain Swaps will be required to be traded on an exchange or execution facility starting in February 2014.  

      16    

Table of Contents 

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC (collectively, Swaps Entities). Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers and in the future additional subsidiaries may register with the CFTC as swap dealers. One or more subsidiaries of the Company will in the future be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers.  

Swaps Entities are or will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime with new obligations for the Swaps activities for which they are registered, including new capital requirements, a new margin regime for uncleared Swaps and a new segregation regime for collateral of counterparties to uncleared Swaps. Swaps Entities are subject to additional duties, including, among others, internal and external business conduct and documentation standards with respect to their Swaps counterparties, recordkeeping and reporting. The Companys swap dealers are also subject to new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act regarding segregation of customer collateral for cleared transactions, large trader reporting, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements related to activities in Swaps.  

The specific parameters of these requirements for Swaps have been and continue to be developed through CFTC, SEC and bank regulator rulemakings. While many of the CFTCs requirements are already final and effective, others are subject to further rulemaking or deferred compliance dates. In particular, the CFTC, SEC and the banking regulators have proposed, but not yet adopted, rules regarding margin and capital requirements for Swaps Entities. In September 2013, the Basel Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions released their final policy framework on margin requirements for non-centrally-cleared derivatives. The full impact on the Company of the U.S. agencies margin and capital requirements for Swaps Entities will not be known with certainty until the requirements are finalized. In November 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules that, if finalized as proposed, would limit positions in 28 agricultural, energy and metals commodities, including swaps, futures and options that are economically equivalent to those commodity contracts. Through this re-proposal, the CFTC is taking steps to institute position limits that were previously finalized in November 2011 but were vacated by a federal court in September 2012.  

Although the full impact of U.S. derivatives regulation on the Company remains unclear, the Company has already, and will continue to, face increased costs and regulatory oversight due to the registration and regulatory requirements indicated above. Complying with the Swaps rules also has required, and will in the future require, the Company to change its Swaps businesses, and has required, and will in the future require, extensive systems and personnel changes. Compliance with Swap-related partially finalized regulatory capital requirements may require the Company to devote more capital to its Swaps business.  

In July 2013, the CFTC issued final guidance on the cross-border application of its Swaps regulations and an exemptive order providing a delay in compliance timing of certain of those regulations as applied to certain non-U.S. entities engaging in Swaps activities. Even with the issuance of the guidance, the full scope of the extraterritorial impact of U.S. Swaps regulation remains unclear.  

The E.U. has adopted and implemented certain rules relating to the OTC derivatives market and these rules imposed regulatory reporting beginning in February 2014. The E.U. plans to impose central clearing requirements on OTC derivatives in the future. In addition, other non-U.S. jurisdictions are in the process of adopting and implementing legislation emanating from the G20 commitments that will require, among other things, the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives, mandatory reporting of derivatives and bilateral risk mitigation procedures for non-cleared trades. It remains unclear at present how the non-U.S. and U.S. derivatives regulatory regimes will interact.  

Non-U.S. Regulation. The Companys Institutional Securities businesses also are regulated extensively by non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which the Company maintains an office. Non-U.S. policy makers and regulators, including the European Commission and European  

    17      

Table of Contents 

 Supervisory Authorities, continue to propose and adopt numerous market reforms, including those that may further impact the structure of banks, and formulate regulatory standards and measures that will be of relevance and importance to the Companys European operations. Certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries are regulated as broker-dealers under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries engaged in banking and trust activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and several securities and futures exchanges in the United Kingdom (U.K.), including the London Stock Exchange and Euronext.liffe, regulate the Companys activities in the U.K.; the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) and the Deutsche Bôrse AG regulate its activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; Eidgenôssische Finanzmarktaufsicht (the Financial Market Supervisory Authority) regulates its activities in Switzerland; the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of Japan, the Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese securities and futures exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange, regulate its activities in Japan; the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited regulate its operations in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Limited regulate its business in Singapore.  

Regulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictions have also finalized or are in the process of proposing or finalizing risk-based capital, leverage capital, liquidity, banking structural reforms and other regulatory standards applicable to certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. For example, the Companys primary broker-dealer in the U.K., Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (MSIP), is subject to regulation and supervision by the PRA with respect to prudential matters. As a prudential regulator, the PRA seeks to promote the safety and soundness of the firms that it regulates and to minimize the adverse effects that such firms may have on the stability of the U.K. financial system. The PRA has broad legal authority to establish prudential and other standards to pursue these objectives, including approvals of relevant regulatory models, as well as to bring formal and informal supervisory and disciplinary actions against regulated firms to address noncompliance with such standards. MSIP is also regulated and supervised by the FCA with respect to business conduct matters. On January 1, 2014, MSIP became subject to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements (collectively, CRD IV), which implements the Basel III and other regulatory requirements for E.U. investment firms, such as MSIP. European Market Infrastructure Regulation introduces new requirements regarding the central clearing, reporting and conduct of business with respect to derivatives. In addition, proposals to revise the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive would introduce various trading and market infrastructure reforms in the E.U. Lawmakers in the E.U. are also in the process of finalizing a proposed directive that would establish a framework for the recovery and resolution of E.U. credit institutions and investment firms, including MSIP.  

Investment Management.  

Many of the subsidiaries engaged in the Companys asset management activities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Many aspects of the Companys asset management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the Company from carrying on its asset management activities in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for such failure include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on the Company engaging in various asset management activities for specified periods of time or specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines. In order to facilitate its asset management business, the Company owns a registered U.S. broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc., which acts as distributor to the Morgan Stanley mutual funds and as placement agent to certain private investment funds managed by the Companys Investment Management business segment. A number of legal entities within the Companys Investment Management business are registered as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under certain exemptions from such registration

 pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance. See also Institutional Securities and Wealth ManagementBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation and Institutional Securities and Wealth ManagementRegulation of Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities above.  

As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Companys asset management activities will be subject to certain additional laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements (including with respect to clients that are private funds), restrictions on sponsoring or investing in, or maintaining certain other relationships with, covered funds, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to certain limited exemptions, and certain rules and regulations regarding trading activities, including trading in derivatives markets. Many of these new requirements may increase the expenses associated with the Companys asset management activities and/or reduce the investment returns the Company is able to generate for its asset management clients. Several important elements of the Dodd-Frank Act will not be known until rulemaking is finalized and certain final regulations are adopted.  

The Company is continuing its review of its asset management activities that may be affected by the Volcker Rule and is taking steps to establish the necessary compliance programs to help ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule. The Company had already taken certain steps to comply with the Volcker Rule prior to the issuance of the final regulations, including, for example, launching new funds that are designed to comply with the Volcker Rule. Given the complexity of the new framework, the full impact of the Volcker Rule is still uncertain, and will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight. See also Financial Holding CompanyActivities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule.  

The Companys Investment Management business is also regulated outside the U.S. For example, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority regulate the Companys business in the U.K.; the Financial Services Agency regulates the Companys business in Japan; the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission regulates the Companys business in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates the Companys business in Singapore.  

Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions.  

The Companys Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program is coordinated on an enterprise-wide basis. In the U.S., for example, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, bank holding company subsidiaries, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, and mutual funds to implement AML programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Outside the U.S., applicable laws, rules and regulations similarly require designated types of financial institutions to implement AML programs. The Company has implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. The Company has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to the U.S. foreign policy, national security, or economy; by other governments; or by global or regional multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Security Council and the E.U. as applicable.  

Anti-Corruption.  

The Company is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.

Protection of Client Information.  

Many aspects of the Companys business are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer information, including those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the E.U. Data Protection Directive and various laws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal Information (Protection) Law, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act. The Company has adopted measures designed to comply with these and related applicable requirements in all relevant jurisdictions.  

Research.  

Both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators continue to focus on research conflicts of interest. Research-related regulations have been implemented in many jurisdictions. New and revised requirements resulting from these regulations and the global research settlement with U.S. federal and state regulators (to which the Company is a party) have necessitated the development or enhancement of corresponding policies and procedures.  

Compensation Practices and Other Regulation.  

The Companys compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In particular, the Company is subject to the Federal Reserves guidance that is designed to help ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. The scope and content of the Federal Reserves policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and may change based on findings from its peer review process, and the Company expects that these policies will evolve over a number of years.  

The Company is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which may impact its compensation practices. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must prescribe regulations to require covered financial institutions, including the Company, to report the structures of all of their incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing employees, directors or principal shareholders with compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the covered financial institution. In April 2011, seven federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, jointly proposed an interagency rule implementing this requirement. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC must direct listing exchanges to require companies to implement policies relating to disclosure of incentive-based compensation that is based on publicly reported financial information and the clawback of such compensation from current or former executive officers following certain accounting restatements.  

In addition to the guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and referenced above, the Companys compensation practices may also be impacted by other regulations, including those promulgated in accordance with the FSB compensation principles and standards, CRD IV, Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive regulations, the fifth Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive and proposed second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. The FSB standards are to be implemented by local regulators, including in the U.K., where the remuneration of employees of certain banks is governed by the Remuneration Code. In the E.U., beginning on January 1, 2014, the Companys compensation practices with respect to certain employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the Companys E.U. operations will be subject to CRD IV, which includes a fixed cap on bonuses and other variable remuneration restrictions.
