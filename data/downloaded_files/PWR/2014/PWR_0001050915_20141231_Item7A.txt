ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates.  

Credit Risk. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits and money market mutual funds with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our customersÂ’ ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the depressed economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts is limited because of the diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and in some cases we obtain collateral or other security from our customers.  

Interest Rate Risk. As of December 31, 2014, we had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As such, we were exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long-term obligations. As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our variable rate debt of $68.8 million approximated book value. Our weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 2.71%. The effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would be negligible.  

Foreign Currency Risk. We conduct operations primarily in the United States, Canada and Australia, and our financial performance is subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. We are subject to foreign currency risk with respect to sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of our operating units. To minimize the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our currency risk on a cash flow basis. There were no outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2014.
