ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) designs, develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions. These solutions have several components:  Advanced integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs); Software design tools to program the PLDs; Predefined system functions delivered as intellectual property (IP) cores; Design services; Customer training; and Field engineering and technical support. 

Our PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our solutions are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, test and measurement, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. 

Xilinx was founded and incorporated in California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com. 

Industry Overview 

There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Xilinx develops PLDs, a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs include custom gate arrays, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs). These devices all compete with each other since they may be utilized in many of the same types of applications within electronic systems. However, variations in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, density, functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine the degree to which the devices compete for specific applications. 

The primary advantage PLDs have over custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs is that PLDs enable faster time-to-market because of their shorter design cycles. Users can program the PLD to implement their design, using software to create and revise their designs relatively quickly with lower development costs. PLDs typically have a larger die size resulting in higher costs per unit compared to custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, which are customized to perform a limited fixed function. Custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, however, generally offer less flexibility, require longer fabrication lead times and higher up-front costs than PLDs. 

PLDs are standard components. This means that the same device type can be sold to many different users for many different applications. As a result, the development cost of PLDs can be spread over a large number of users. Custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, on the other hand, are custom chips for an individual user for use in a specific application. ASSPs implement specific functions for a limited set of users. This involves a high up-front cost to users. Technology advances are enabling PLD companies to reduce costs considerably, making PLDs an increasingly attractive alternative to custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs.

revenues. Some of our more mature product families have been excluded from the table although they continue to generate revenues. We operate and track our results in one operating segment for financial reporting purposes. 

Product Families 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Virtex FPGAs 

The Virtex-5 FPGA family consists of 24 devices and is the latest generation Virtex family and the PLD industrys first product family manufactured using 65-nanometer (nm) process technology. The Virtex-5 family consists of four platforms: Virtex-5 LX FPGAs for logic-intensive designs, Virtex-5 LXT FPGAs for high-performance logic with serial connectivity, Virtex-5 SXT FPGAs for high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) with serial connectivity and Virtex-5 FXT FPGAs for embedded processing with serial connectivity. Within each platform are a number of offerings, differing primarily in the amount of logic, memory, clock and input/output (I/O) resources provided. These offerings enable customers to select the optimal mix of resources for their particular application. Currently, Xilinx is shipping devices from all platforms. Compared to previous 90-nm Virtex family products, this product family offers increased performance, density and features, while reducing dynamic power consumption. 

The 17-device Virtex-4 FPGA family consists of three platforms: LX, SX and FX. Virtex-4 LX FPGAs are optimized for logic-intensive designs, Virtex-4 SX FPGAs are optimized for high-performance DSP, and Virtex-4 FX FPGAs are optimized for embedded processing with serial connectivity. Virtex-4 devices are produced on 90-nm process technology. 

Prior generation Virtex families include Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-II, Virtex-E and the original Virtex family. 

5 

 Spartan FPGAs 

The Spartan-3 generation FPGAs were the PLD industrys first 90-nm FPGAs and were developed as a programmable alternative to ASICs for new applications in high growth end markets such as consumer, automotive and low cost networking. The Spartan-3 generation is comprised of three primary platforms including the original Spartan-3 family, the Spartan-3E family, and the Spartan-3A family. The Spartan-3E family consists of five devices and is optimized to deliver the lowest cost per logic cell. The Spartan-3A family consists of 14 devices and is optimized to deliver the lowest cost per I/O. In addition, this family has devices targeted for cost sensitive, high performance signal processing applications and nonvolatile devices optimized for cost sensitive applications where security and board space are customer priorities. 

Prior generation Spartan families include Spartan-IIE, Spartan-II, Spartan XL and the original Spartan family. 

 EasyPath FPGAs 

EasyPath FPGAs use the same production masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a specific customer application to improve yield and lower costs. As a result, EasyPath FPGAs provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the standard FPGA devices without the conversion risk, conversion engineering effort or the additional time required to move to an ASIC. EasyPath FPGAs are available for the higher density devices of the Virtex-II, Virtex-II Pro and Virtex-4 families. EasyPath FPGAs will also be available for the higher densities of the Virtex-5 families. Customers purchasing EasyPath FPGAs must meet certain minimum order requirements and pay a custom test generation charge. 

 CPLDs 

CPLDs operate on the low end of the programmable logic density spectrum. CPLDs are single chip, nonvolatile solutions characterized by instant-on and universal interconnect. 

The CoolRunner-II family is the latest generation Xilinx CPLD family with six devices in production. CoolRunner-II CPLDs combine the advantages of ultra low power consumption with the benefits of high performance and low cost. While CoolRunner-II is suitable for a wide variety of end markets and applications, the ultra low power consumption and small package profiles of these devices have led to their acceptance in the growing portable consumer electronics marketplace. 

The CoolRunner XPLA3 family was the first CPLD product to combine very low power consumption with high density logic and high I/O counts in a single device. This family consists of six devices. 

Prior generation CPLD families include the XC9500, XC9500XL and XC9500XV which offer low cost, high performance and in-system programmability for 5.0-volt, 3.3-volt and 2.5-volt systems, respectively. These families are widely used in communications and industrial applications.

Please see information under the caption Results of Operations  Net Revenues in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information about our revenues from our product families. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development (R&D) activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs, the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the design of IP cores of logic and the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering power consumption. As a result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past years including the Virtex-5 and Virtex-4 series of FPGAs, and the Spartan-3 FPGA series. Additionally, we have made major enhancements to our IP core offerings and introduced new versions of our ISE software. To support embedded processing and DSP design on our platform FPGA devices, the Platform Studio tool suite and System Generator for DSP have been further enhanced. We extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of 90-nm and 65-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing technology and we are the first company in the PLD industry to ship 65-nm devices. 

Our R&D challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost-effective solutions for customers. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, our R&D expenses were $358.1 million, $388.1 million and $326.1 million, respectively. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success and we are committed to continuing a significant level of R&D effort. 

Sales and Distribution 

We sell our products to OEMs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs or subcontract manufacturers. 

We use dedicated global sales and marketing organizations as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing those customers in defined territories. Distributors create demand within the balance of our customer base. Distributors also provide vendor-managed inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM customers. 

Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, such as credit loss, inventory shrinkage and theft, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability. 

In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted the distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a subsequent change in list prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors end customers. 

7 

Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. As of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, Avnet accounted for 83% and 86% of the Companys total accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 61%, 67% and 70% of the Companys worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, as we deem appropriate given the level of business and their performance. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by custom gate arrays, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information about concentrations of credit risk and Note 15 for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations. 

Backlog 

As of March 29, 2008, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $202.0 million, compared to $190.0 million as of March 31, 2007. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result, backlogs from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period. 

Wafer Fabrication 

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our products. Rather, we purchase wafers from multiple foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba), Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko) and He Jian Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Currently, UMC manufactures the substantial majority of our wafers. Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by our periodic negotiations with the wafer foundries. 

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of leading-edge process technologies. 

In September 1995, we entered into a joint venture with UMC and other parties to construct a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC). In January 2000, as a result of the merger of USIC into UMC, our equity position in USIC was converted into shares of UMC, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In fiscal 2007, we sold a portion of our UMC shares and we sold the remaining shares of our UMC investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Also see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

In fiscal 1997, we signed a wafer purchasing agreement with Seiko that was amended in fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000. Seiko manufactures wafers for our older, more mature product lines. 

In October 2004, the Company entered into an advanced purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company paid Toshiba a total of $100.0 million in two equal installments for advance payment of silicon wafers produced under the agreement. The original agreement was extended to December 2008. The balance of the advance payment remaining was $4.5 million at March 29, 2008. 

Sort, Assembly and Test 

Wafers purchased are sorted by the foundry, independent sort subcontractors, or by Xilinx. Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are tested by Xilinx personnel at our San Jose, California, Dublin, Ireland or Singapore facilities or by independent test subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our testing services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines and STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in Singapore. 

Quality Certification 

Xilinx has achieved ISO 9001 quality certification in our San Jose, California, Dublin, Ireland, Longmont, Colorado, Singapore and Albuquerque locations. In addition, Xilinx achieved 

8 

ISO 14001, TL 9000 and TS 16949 environmental and quality certifications in the San Jose, Dublin and Singapore locations and TL 9000 and TS16949 quality certifications in the Albuquerque location. 

Patents and Licenses 

While our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of March 29, 2008, we held 1,785 issued United States patents relating to our products, which vary in duration. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, software, IC architecture, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to PLDs. We intend to vigorously protect our intellectual property. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights (for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the future, we may incur litigation expenses to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful. 

We have acquired various software licenses that permit us to grant sublicenses to our customers for certain third party software programs licensed with our software design tools. In addition, we have licensed certain software for internal use in product design. We are also licensed under certain third party patents and have provided some third parties licenses under Company patents. 

Employees 

As of March 29, 2008, we had 3,415 employees compared to 3,353 at the end of the prior fiscal year. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.
