ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

INTRODUCTION  

Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 58 countries. These businesses are internally reported as 52 operating segments to senior management. The Companys 52 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Transportation; Power Systems & Electronics; Industrial Packaging; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Polymers & Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other.  

Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Companys decentralized operating style, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.  

The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Companys results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues.  

A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their businesses. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:  

       Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.  

       Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.  

       Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.  

       Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.  

The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.

INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE  

Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company now reports both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. Prior to this, the international fiscal reporting period began on December 1st and ended on November 30th. The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior period financial statements presented. Refer to the International Reporting Lag note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the international reporting change.  

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. For businesses reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income, all related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2011 and 2010, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Revenues  

Revenues increased 15.4% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to higher base revenues, revenues from acquisitions, and the favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues increased 7.5% in 2011 versus 2010 as worldwide economic conditions strengthened. However, European economic conditions slowed in the second half of the year. North American and international base revenues increased 9.0% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2011 versus 2010. Base revenues in Europe and China increased 5.6% and 14.2%, respectively, in 2011 versus 2010. End markets associated with welding, transportation and test and measurement businesses showed strength in 2011. In 2012, the company anticipates continued growth in North American and Asia Pacific markets with European markets expected to be relatively flat as compared to 2011.  

Revenues increased 13.6% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues increased 10.1% in 2010 versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic indices across many geographies as worldwide end markets began to recover from the global recession. North American and international base revenues increased 11.2% and 9.1%, respectively, in 2010 versus 2009. End markets associated with transportation, welding, industrial packaging, PC board fabrication and electronics showed improvement in 2010.  

14  

Operating Income  

Operating income increased 21.2% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions. Base margins increased 120 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons. Additionally, acquisitions and divestitures diluted margins by 40 basis points primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets.  

Operating income increased 63.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, and 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Base margins increased 300 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. Additionally, benefits from restructuring projects were partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses in 2010 versus 2009 reflect the Companys 2009 efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively, compared to $1.0 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2010.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

24  

In 2011 and 2010, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Revenues  

Revenues increased 11.2% in 2011 versus 2010 due to an increase in base business revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a test and measurement business in the fourth quarter of 2010, a heat transfer business in the second quarter of 2011, and a plastics and security business in the second quarter of 2010. Base business revenues for the test and measurement businesses increased 15.7% due to increased equipment orders both internationally and in North America. Growing worldwide product regulatory standards contributed to growth in these businesses. Base revenues for the consumer packaging business increased 4.8% in 2011 versus 2010 due to growth in the beverage packaging solutions, decorating equipment and marking and labels businesses. Base revenues for the industrial fasteners and appliance businesses declined 0.7% due to prolonged construction-associated weakness in the appliance end market, partially offset by increased demand in the industrial fasteners end market.  

Revenues increased 16.1% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to an increase in base business revenues and revenues from acquisitions. The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a consumer packaging business in the fourth quarter of 2009. Base business revenues increased 9.5% for the test and measurement businesses due to increased demand for capital equipment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Base revenues increased 8.2% in 2010 versus 2009 for the consumer packaging business due to improvement in decorating end markets. Base revenues for the industrial fasteners and appliance businesses improved 15.2% due to increased demand for domestic appliances.  

Operating Income  

Operating income increased 23.5% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the growth in base revenues. Base margins increased 200 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenues and benefits from past restructuring projects. In addition, acquisitions and divestitures diluted total operating margins by 30 basis points in 2011.  

Operating income increased 39.1% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the growth in base revenues and lower restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 230 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenues and benefits from past restructuring projects, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. In addition, lower restructuring expenses increased total operating margins by 110 basis points. Acquisitions and divestitures diluted total operating margins by 70 basis points in 2010.  

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

Amortization expense increased to $255.3 million in 2011 and $207.4 million in 2010, versus $197.5 million in 2009, due to intangible asset amortization for newly acquired businesses.  

25  

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

In 2011, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment assessment which resulted in no goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. Total goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2009 charges were primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.  

INTEREST EXPENSE  

Interest expense increased to $192.1 million in 2011 which includes interest expense on the 3.375% and 4.875% notes issued in late August 2011, versus $175.2 million in 2010. Interest expense increased to $175.2 million in 2010 versus $164.6 million in 2009 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes, which were repaid at maturity in March 2009, and lower commercial paper borrowings. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper was 0.1% in 2011, 0.2% in 2010 and 0.3% in 2009.  

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  

Other income (expense) was income of $53.8 million in 2011 versus $10.0 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher interest income of $40.3 million (versus $24.1 million in 2010), lower losses on foreign currency transactions of $4.3 million (versus $16.7 million in 2010) and gains on disposal of operating affiliates of $1.8 million (versus losses of $8.0 million in 2010).  

Other income (expense) was income of $10.0 million in 2010 versus expense of $4.5 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher income from investments of $20.8 million (versus $4.9 million in 2009).  

INCOME TAXES  

The effective tax rate was 22.2% in 2011, 30.5% in 2010, and 20.2% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by the discrete non-cash tax benefit of $165.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the decision in the Companys favor by the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions that had been challenged by the Australian Tax Office. The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by discrete tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of $85.5 million related to a global legal structure reorganization and $77.5 million related to a favorable settlement reached with the German tax authorities. In the above mentioned reorganization, the Company reorganized its ownership structure in certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2009 and made an election regarding the U.S. tax treatment of a foreign subsidiary. The Company recorded a reduction in tax expense primarily for the effect of the resulting foreign tax credits. Also during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a settlement with the German tax authorities primarily regarding the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction which resulted in the reversal of previously established tax reserves as a reduction of tax expense.  

See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details on these discrete tax adjustments and a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.  

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  

Income from continuing operations in 2011 of $2.0 billion ($4.08 per diluted share) was 38.9% higher than 2010 income of $1.5 billion ($2.89 per diluted share). Income from continuing operations in 2010 was 49.9% higher than 2009 income of $968.6 million ($1.93 per diluted share).  

26  

FOREIGN CURRENCY  

The weakening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2011 versus 2010 increased operating revenues by approximately $460 million in 2011 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately 10 cents per diluted share. The weakening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2010 versus 2009 increased operating revenues by approximately $70 million in 2010 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately 4 cents per diluted share.  

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

Income from discontinued operations was $54.4 million in 2011 versus $50.5 million in 2010 primarily due to improved operating results in the held for sale finishing businesses partially offset by an after-tax loss on the sale of a discontinued operation in 2011 versus an after-tax gain in 2010. Income from discontinued operations was $50.5 million in 2010 versus $4.1 million in 2009 due to improved operating results in the held for sale finishing businesses and an after-tax gain on the sale of a discontinued operation in 2010 versus after-tax losses in 2009. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The Companys primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.  

The primary uses of liquidity are:  

       dividend payments  the Companys dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years free operating cash flow;  

       acquisitions; and  

       any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases.  

Cash Flow  

The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

27  

On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period of time (the 2007 Program). Under the 2007 Program, the Company made repurchases of approximately 16.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $53.51 and approximately 8.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.29 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 Program.  

On May 6, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $4.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period of time (the 2011 Program). Through December 31, 2011, the Company made repurchases of approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.20. As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $3.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.  

Return on Average Invested Capital  

The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Companys operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 220 basis point increase in ROIC in 2011 versus 2010 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 35.6%, primarily due to an increase in base business and a favorable tax rate, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital.  

The 400 basis point increase in ROIC in 2010 versus 2009 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 41.9%, primarily due to an increase in base business, partially offset by a less favorable tax rate and a slight increase in average invested capital.  

28  

Working Capital  

Net working capital at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the United States. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses short-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S. 

Debt  

Total debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2016 and $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. The remaining $500.0 million is provided under a revolving credit facility that terminates on June 15, 2012. No amounts are outstanding under these three facilities. The Companys foreign operations also have unused capacity on uncommitted facilities of approximately $329 million.  

The Company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately $192.5 million at December 31, 2011, which is included in short-term debt, and no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2010. The maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2011 was $1.8 billion while the average daily balance was $744.9 million.  

29  

In August 2011, the Company issued $350.0 million of 3.375% notes due September 15, 2021 at 99.552% of face value and $650.0 million of 4.875% notes due September 15, 2041 at 98.539% of face value. The effective interest rates of the notes are 3.4% and 4.9%, respectively. These notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to repay outstanding commercial paper.  

The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Companys targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.  

Total Debt to EBITDA  

The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.  

Total debt to EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

The Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As of December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $187.8 million. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.  

At December 31, 2011, the Company had open stand-by letters of credit of approximately $213.0 million, substantially all of which expire in 2012 and 2013. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2011.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

These critical accounting policies are as follows:  

Realizability of Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Companys businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition, for approximately 44% of the U.S. inventories, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method due to the effects of inflation.  

Collectibility of Accounts Receivable  The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.  

Depreciation of Plant and Equipment  The Companys U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:  

  Buildings and improvements   150% declining balance 

  Machinery and equipment   200% declining balance  

The majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations.  

31  

Income Taxes  The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Companys deferred and other tax balances are based on managements interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Companys various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Companys business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Companys total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its 52 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.  

As of December 31, 2011, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of $7.4 billion allocated to its 52 reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 52 reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Companys 80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately $5 million to $830 million, with the average amount equal to $140 million.  

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Companys global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. Pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participants years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.  

The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $32 million.  

The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2011 and will be 8.0% for 2012. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on how this rate is determined.
