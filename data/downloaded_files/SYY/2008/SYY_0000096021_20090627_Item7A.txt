Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

Interest Rate Risk  

 We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates.  

 We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.  

Fiscal 2009  

 As of June 27, 2009, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our long-term debt obligations as of June 27, 2009 were $2,476,649,000, of which approximately 99% were at fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of June 27, 2009.  

 The following table presents our interest rate position as of June 27, 2009. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents.

Fiscal 2008  

 As of June 28, 2008, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our long-term debt obligations as of June 28, 2008 were $1,980,331,000, of which approximately 99% were at fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of June 28, 2008.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

 The majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiarys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements  

34   
of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 1.2% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and increased sales 1.0% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The impact to our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2009 year-end exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2009 sales by an additional 0.8% and would not have materially impacted our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share. We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks.  

 Our Canadian financing subsidiary has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in U.S. dollars. We have the potential to create taxable income in Canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2009 year-end exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations.  

Fuel Price Risk  

 The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.6% of sales, respectively. Fuel costs, excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, incurred by Sysco increased by approximately $33,154,000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and $34,023,000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.  

 From time to time, we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of June 27, 2009, we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately $64,000,000 through March 2010. In July 2009, we entered additional forward purchase commitments totaling approximately $16,000,000 at a fixed price through June 2010. Together, these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 40% of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2010. Our commitments through August 2009 were entered into at prevailing rates from mid-July through mid-August 2008. As a result, these contracts are at fixed prices greater than both the prices incurred during same periods in the previous fiscal year and current market prices. The remainder of our outstanding contracts were entered into at the prevailing rates in March, April and July 2009 and thus the fixed price on these contracts reflects the lower current market price for diesel.  

 Fuel costs in fiscal 2010, exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to decrease by approximately $50,000,000 to $80,000,000 as compared to fiscal 2009. Our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid-August 2009, the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2010 and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. A 10% unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential decrease to $40,000,000 to $70,000,000.  

Investment Risk  

 Sysco invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies in order to fund certain retirement programs which are subject to market risk. The value of our investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments, which include publicly traded securities. Therefore, the value of these policies will be adjusted each period based on the performance of the underlying securities which could result in volatility in our earnings. Due to the declines in the financial markets in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, we have experienced significant losses in adjusting the carrying value of these policies to their cash surrender values in these periods. Should the financial markets decline, we would take charges to adjust the carrying value of our corporate-owned life insurance, and if the market declines are significant, these charges could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating expenses, net income and earnings per share. A 10% unfavorable change in publicly traded securities held within our investments in corporate-owned life insurance would not have a material impact on our operating expenses, net income and earnings per share.  

 Our company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities. The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon, among other things, the return on the plans assets and discount rates used to calculate the plans liability. As a result of the declines in the financial markets in fiscal 2009, the value of the investments held by the Retirement Plan declined as of June 27, 2009 as compared to June 28, 2008. These fluctuations in asset values have caused the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase, have caused pension expense for fiscal 2010 to increase and have resulted in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of June 27, 2009, which is when this plans funded status was last measured. Also, the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets. Specifically, decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations. To the extent the financial markets experience further  

35   
declines, our anticipated future contributions, pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years as well. A 10% unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company-sponsored Retirement Plan at the plans fiscal year end (December 31, 2008) would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2010; however, this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2010 by $23,700,000 and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of June 27, 2009 by $76,630,000.
