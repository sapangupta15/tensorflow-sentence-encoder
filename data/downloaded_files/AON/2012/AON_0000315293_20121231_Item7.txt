Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 On April 2, 2012, we completed the Redomestication, moving our corporate headquarters to London. In the Redomestication, each issued and outstanding share of Aon Corporation common stock held by stockholders of Aon Corporation was converted into the right to receive one Class A Ordinary Share, nominal value $0.01 per share, of Aon plc. In connection with the Redomestication, we have incurred costs related to the headquarters relocation of $26 million in 2012. We anticipate that we will incur an additional $4 million of costs through 2013 related to the headquarters relocation. We believe the Redomestication will strengthen our long term strategy by:   

Enabling Risk Solutions to deliver superior value to our clients by improving execution on the Aon Broking strategy;   

Expanding the HR Solutions portfolio penetration, especially within consulting, which already has a significant presence in the U.K. and EMEA;  

Enhancing our Risk Solutions' relationship with, and integration into, London markets;   

Increasing our connection to emerging markets, accelerating our ability to grow there, and further aligning our strategy with underwriters and carriers who are also targeting these high growth markets;  

Strengthening our international brand awareness and positioning as a global firm;   

Advancing our talent strategy through better development, retention and acquisition of professional talent, with a special focus on London's insurance talent; and  

Optimizing our fiscal planning and capital allocation and reducing our global tax rate in a manner that provides us with the increased flexibility to properly invest in our growth.   

 During 2012, we continued to face certain headwinds impacting our business. In our Risk Solutions segment, these included economic weakness in continental Europe and a significant decline in investment income due to lower short-term interest rates globally. In our HR Solutions segment, these headwinds included price compression in our benefits administration business and competitive pressures across continental Europe.  

The following is a summary of our 2012 financial results:   

Revenue increased $227 million, or 2%, to $11.5 billion in 2012 due primarily to solid organic revenue growth of 4% in both the Risk Solutions and HR Solutions segments, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by strong management of the renewal book portfolio across all regions and solid new business growth in Asia and other emerging markets, as well as solid growth across our Reinsurance business and new client wins in our HR Solutions segment.  

Operating expenses increased $227 million, or 2%, from the prior year to $9.9 billion in 2012, primarily as a result of organic revenue growth of 4%, higher intangible asset amortization expenses of $61 million, and an increase in headquarters relocation costs of $21 million, partially offset by benefits achieved from the restructuring plans, a decrease in Hewitt related integration costs of $47 million, $18 million related to the write-off of legacy receivables in 2011, and a decrease in restructuring charges of $12 million.  

Our consolidated operating margin from continuing operations for the year on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis was 13.9% in 2012, a decrease of 20 basis points from our operating margin of 14.1% in 2011.   

40 

Net income from continuing operations attributable to Aon shareholders was $994 million, an increase of $19 million, or 2%, from $975 million in 2011.  

Cash flows from operating activities was a record $1.4 billion in 2012, an increase of $401 million, or 28%, from $1.0 billion in 2011.   

 We historically have focused on three key metrics that we communicate to shareholders: grow organically, expand margins, and increase earnings per share. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, and going forward, we will add free cash flow to our key metrics given its fundamental importance to both the value of the firm and how we think about value creation for shareholders. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2012:   

Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was 4% in 2012, demonstrating continued improvement compared to the prior year's 2% organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was driven by solid growth across our businesses in both Risk and HR Solutions. In Risk Solutions, strong management of the renewal book portfolio across all regions, solid new business growth in Asia and other emerging markets, and growth across our treaty business in Reinsurance drove organic revenue growth. In HR Solutions, organic growth was driven by new client wins in outsourcing and increased demand across consulting.  

Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was 18.6% for Aon overall, 21.7% for the Risk Solutions segment, and 16.6% for the HR Solutions segment in 2012. In 2011, adjusted operating margin was 19.0% for Aon overall, 21.6% for the Risk Solutions segment, and 17.6% for the HR Solutions segment. The increase in adjusted operating margin for the Risk Solutions segment reflects strong organic revenue growth and restructuring savings, partially offset by investments in Asia, Latin America and GRIP solutions, as well as lower investment income. The decrease in adjusted operating margin for both the HR Solutions segment and Aon overall reflects significant investment in new growth opportunities in health care exchanges and HR BPO and anticipated pricing compression in our benefits administration business, partially offset by new client wins.  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Aon shareholders, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was $4.21 per share in 2012, an increase of $0.15 per share, or 4%, from $4.06 per share in 2011. The increase demonstrates solid operational performance and effective capital management despite a difficult business environment, as well as the impact of $1.1 billion of share repurchases during 2012.  

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was $1.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $373 million, or 48%, from $777 million in 2011. The increase in free cash flow from the prior year was driven by record cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion in 2012.   

 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

 General  

 In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results.  

41 

 Organic Revenue  

 We use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, reimbursable expenses, and certain unusual items. Supplemental information related to organic growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages to the reported Commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages, has been provided in the "Review by Segment" caption, below.  

 Adjusted Operating Margins  

 We use adjusted operating margin as a measure of core operating performance of our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions segments. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, including restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and headquarters relocation costs. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  

42 

 Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure to the reported operating margin is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes unallocated expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenue.   

 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  

 We also use adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as a measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and headquarters relocation costs, along with related income taxes. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Free Cash Flow  

 We use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a measure of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations  

 Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. For comparative purposes, the methodology used to calculate this impact is intended to isolate the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating last year's revenue, expenses and net income at this year's foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.06 during the year ended December 31, 2012, on adjusted net income from continuing operations per diluted share when the Company translates prior year results at current year end foreign exchange rates for comparative purposes.  

45 

 Summary of Results  

 The consolidated results of continuing operations are as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consolidated Results for 2012 Compared to 2011  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $227 million, or 2%, to $11.5 billion in 2012, as compared to $11.3 billion in 2011. The increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 4% for both the Risk Solutions and HR Solutions segments. Organic growth in the Risk Solutions segment was driven by solid growth across all regions, including strong new business growth for U.S. retail and continued management of the renewal book portfolio in the Americas. International organic revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Asia and in emerging markets, as well as modest growth in continental Europe. Reinsurance organic growth was driven by strong growth across global treaty, driven by favorable pricing in the near-term and new business growth, partially offset by a significant decline in capital market transactions and advisory business. Organic growth in the HR Solutions segment was driven by growth in investment consulting, pension administration services, talent and rewards, and communications consulting, as well as new client wins in HR BPO, partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased $142 million, or 2%, when compared to 2011. The increase was driven by 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives.  

46 

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses increased by $85 million, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was due largely to an increase in intangible amortization of $61 million and increased costs related to the headquarters relocation of $21 million. These increased costs were partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $12 million and restructuring savings.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income decreased $8 million, or 44%, from 2011, due to lower average interest rates globally.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, decreased $17 million, or 7%, from 2011. The decrease was due primarily to a lower average debt outstanding during the year, as well as the use of commercial paper to meet short-term working capital needs.  

 Other Income (Expense)  

 Other income (expense) in 2012 of $3 million decreased $12 million from 2011. The decrease in income is the result of foreign exchange gains (losses) that were $26 million additional loss in 2012 and an $11 million decrease in gains related to long-term investments, partially offset by $6 million of additional income from equity method investments and $19 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2011.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.4 billion, flat as compared to $1.4 billion in 2011.  

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 26.1% in 2012 and 27.3% in 2011. The 2012 rate reflects the release of a valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits and net operating losses, partially offset by the impact of a U.K. tax rate change. The 2011 rate reflects the release of a valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits offset partially by net unfavorable deferred tax adjustments in non-U.S. jurisdictions including the impact of a U.K. tax rate change. The underlying tax rate for continuing operations is estimated to be approximately 26.0% for 2013.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations remained at $1.0 billion ($2.99 diluted net income per share) in 2012 as compared to $1.0 billion ($2.86 diluted net income per share) in 2011.  

 Consolidated Results for 2011 Compared to 2010  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $2.8 billion, or 33%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase principally reflects a $2.4 billion, or 113%, increase in the HR Solutions segment, and a $394 million, or 6%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment. The 113% increase in the HR Solutions segment was principally driven by acquisitions, primarily Hewitt in October 2010, net of dispositions, and a 2% positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates with flat organic revenue growth. The 6%  

47 

increase in the Risk Solutions segment was primarily driven by a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, a 2% increase in organic revenue growth reflecting the growth in both the Americas and International regions and a 1% increase from acquisitions, primarily Glenrand MIB Limited ("Glenrand") in April 2011, net of dispositions.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased $1.5 billion, or 29%, when compared to 2010. The increase reflects a $1.3 billion, or 101%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $161 million, or 4%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment. In total, the increase for the year was driven by the impact of the Hewitt and Glenrand acquisitions and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives. In addition, 2010 included a $49 million non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets.  

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses increased by $925 million, or 42%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase reflects a $852 million, or 152%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $113 million, or 7%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment partially offset by a $46 million decrease in unallocated expenses. The overall increase was due largely to the impact of the Hewitt and Glenrand acquisitions, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses and intangible amortization, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. These increased costs were partially offset by lower restructuring charges and restructuring savings and operational expense management.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income increased $3 million, or 20%, from 2010, due to higher levels of interest bearing assets.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $63 million, or 35%, from 2010 due to an increase in the amount of debt outstanding for the full year primarily related to the Hewitt acquisition. Additionally, 2010 included charges of $14 million attributable to a $1.5 billion Bridge Loan Facility that was put in place to finance the Hewitt acquisition, but was cancelled following the issuance of the notes.  

 Other Income (Expense)  

 Other income (expense) of $15 million in 2011 includes death benefits on certain Company owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses and write-offs related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds and other long-term investments and a $19 million loss on the extinguishment of debt. Additionally, 2010 included a loss of $8 million on extinguishment of debt and losses related to certain long-term investments, partially offset by gains related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.4 billion, a 31% increase from $1.1 billion in 2010. The increase in income was driven by the 2% increase in organic growth, the inclusion of Hewitt's and Glenrand's operating results, lower costs and increased benefits from restructuring initiatives and operational improvement, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.  

48 

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.3% in 2011 and 28.4% in 2010. The 2011 rate reflects the release of a valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits offset partially by net unfavorable deferred tax adjustments in non-U.S. jurisdictions including the impact of a U.K. tax rate change. The 2010 rate reflects the impact of the Hewitt acquisition in the fourth quarter, the favorable effect of a U.S. pension expense adjustment, which had a tax rate of 40%, and deferred tax adjustments.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations increased to $1.0 billion ($2.86 diluted net income per share) in 2011 from $759 million ($2.46 diluted net income per share) in 2010. Currency fluctuations positively impacted income from continuing operations in 2011 by $0.04 per diluted share, when the 2010 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2011 foreign exchange rates.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 In 2011, after-tax income from discontinued operations of $4 million ($0.01 diluted net income per share) was recorded compared to after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $27 million ($0.09 diluted net loss per share) in 2010. The loss in 2010 was driven by the settlement of legacy litigation related to the Buckner vs. Resource Life case.  

 Restructuring Initiatives  

 Aon Hewitt Restructuring Plan  

 On October 14, 2010, we announced a global restructuring plan (the "Aon Hewitt Plan") in connection with our acquisition of Hewitt. The Aon Hewitt Plan, which will continue into 2013, is intended to streamline operations across the combined Aon Hewitt organization. The restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $325 million through the end of the plan, consisting of approximately $192 million in employee termination costs and approximately $133 million in real estate lease rationalization costs. An estimated 2,000 positions globally, predominantly non-client facing, are expected to be eliminated as part of the plan.  

 As of December 31, 2012, in excess of 1,900 jobs have been eliminated under the Aon Hewitt Plan and total expenses of $255 million have been incurred. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  

49 

 The following summarizes the restructuring and related costs, by type, that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Hewitt Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, may vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions that may change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause the Company to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.   

 The following summarizes the restructuring and related expenses by segment that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Hewitt Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Costs included in the Risk Solutions segment are associated with the transfer of the health and benefits consulting business from HR Solutions to Risk Solutions effective January 1, 2012. Costs incurred in 2011 in the HR Solutions segment of $41 million related to the health and benefits consulting business have been reclassified and presented in the Risk Solutions segment.   

 The restructuring plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver approximately $280 million of annual savings in 2013, of which, approximately $52 million will be achieved in the Risk Solution segment. We expect to achieve approximately $355 million in annual cost savings across the Company in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to the restructuring plan, and additional savings in areas such as information technology, procurement and public company costs. All of the components of the restructuring and integration plan are not finalized and actual total savings, costs and timing may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the plan. We estimate that we realized approximately $236 million and $137 million of cost savings before any reinvestment in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Approximately $196 million and $40 million of the cost savings before reinvestment in 2012 was realized in the HR Solutions segment and Risk Solutions segment, respectively.  

50 

 Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan  

 We announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with our 2008 acquisition of Benfield. The restructuring plan was intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan included 810 job eliminations. Additionally, duplicate space and assets were abandoned. The plan was closed in January 2012 and $6 million of costs were incurred in 2012.  

 The following is a summary of the restructuring and related expenses by type that were incurred related to the Aon Benfield Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 All costs associated with the Aon Benfield Plan are included in the Risk Solutions segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These restructuring activities and related expenses were concluded in January 2012.  

 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  

 Liquidity  

 Executive Summary  

 We believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with financial flexibility to create long-term value for our shareholders. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, restructuring initiatives, funding pension obligations and shareholder dividends.  

 Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered a source of liquidity for us.  

 Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments decreased $420 million to $637 million in 2012. During 2012, cash flow from operating activities increased $401 million to a record $1.4 billion. Additional sources of funds in 2012 included $178 million in sales of long-term investments and $440 million in net sales of short-term investments that were non-fiduciary. The primary uses of funds in 2012 included share repurchases of $1.1 billion, cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans in excess of pension expense of $585 million, capital expenditures of $269 million, repayment of debt net of debt issuances of $344 million, and dividends paid to shareholders of $204 million.  

 Our investment grade rating is important to us for a number of reasons, the most important of which is preserving our financial flexibility. If our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, the interest expense on any outstanding balances on our credit facilities would increase and we  

51 

could incur additional requests for pension contributions. To manage unforeseen situations, we have committed credit lines of approximately $1.3 billion and we manage our business to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings. At December 31, 2012, we had no borrowings on these credit lines.  

 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities  

 Net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased $401 million to $1.4 billion as compared to $1.0 billion in 2011. Primary contributors to cash flow from operations included net income of $1.0 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $772 million, primarily related to depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense. These items were partially offset by $585 million of cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans in excess of pension expense. Pension contributions during 2012 were $638 million as compared to $477 million in 2011. In 2013, we expect to contribute $548 million to our major defined benefit plans, with a modest decrease in pension expense. In 2013, we also expect to have cash payments related to restructuring plans of $94 million  

 We continue to progress with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections related to a delay in invoicing HR Solutions' customers in connection with the upgrade of our financial systems that occurred in 2011. We expect the increase in unbilled receivables and accounts receivable of approximately $350 million to reverse and return to normalized levels in 2013.  

 Cash Flows Provided by (Used For) Investing Activities  

 Cash provided by investing activities in 2012 was $177 million. Sales of long term investments provided $178 million and net sales of short term investments provided $440 million, partially offset by acquisitions which used $160 million, and capital expenditures used $269 million.  

 Cash used for investing activities in 2011 was $186 million. Acquisitions used $97 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Glenrand. Net purchases of non-fiduciary short-term investments used $8 million, and capital expenditures used $241 million. The sale of businesses provided $9 million, consisting of proceeds from several small dispositions, and sales, net of purchases, of long-term investments provided $160 million.  

 Cash used for investing activities in 2010 was $2.5 billion. Acquisitions used $2.1 billion, primarily related to the acquisition of Hewitt. Net purchases of non-fiduciary short-term investments used $337 million, and capital expenditures used $180 million. Sales, net of purchases, of long-term investments provided $56 million.  

 Cash Flows Used For Financing Activities  

 Cash used for financing activities during 2012 was $1.6 billion. Share repurchases were $1.1 billion and dividends to shareholders were $204 million. Net repayment of debt in 2012 used $344 million. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through employee stock purchase plans were $118 million.  

 Cash used for financing activities during 2011 was $896 million. Share repurchases were $828 million and dividends to shareholders were $200 million. Dividends paid to, and purchase of shares from non-controlling interests were $54 million. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through employee stock purchase plans were $201 million.  

 Cash provided by financing activities during 2010 was $1.8 billion. During 2010 we received $2.9 billion from the issuance of debt, primarily a $600 million 3.5% note due in 2015, a $600 million 5% note due in 2020, a $300 million 6.25% note due 2040, and a $1 billion three-year term note due in 2013, all associated with the acquisition of Hewitt. Additionally, we borrowed $308 million from our Euro credit facility and $100 million of commercial paper during the year, which were repaid as of year  

52 

end. We also repaid $299 million of debt assumed in the Hewitt acquisition. Other uses of cash include $250 million for share repurchases and $175 million for dividends to shareholders. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan were $194 million.  

 Cash and Investments  

 At December 31, 2012, our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were $637 million, a decrease of $420 million as compared to the balance of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011. In both 2012 and 2011, the Company was required to hold £77 million of operating funds in the U.K. as required by the Financial Services Authority, which were included in Short-term investments. These operating funds, when translated to U.S. dollars, were $124 million and $120 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents included restricted balances of $76 million and $71 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The restricted balances primarily relate to cash required to be held as collateral.  

 At December 31, 2012, $138 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and $499 million were held in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S., if repatriated, could have an unfavorable tax impact.  

 In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly, primarily depending on when we collect the premiums, claims and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are required to be invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of $4.0 billion and fiduciary receivables of $8.2 billion at December 31, 2012. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments are not owned by us, and cannot be used for general corporate purposes.  

 The majority of our short-term investments carried at fair value are money market funds. As disclosed in Note 15 "Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Based on market convention, we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We do not believe that there are any significant market liquidity issues affecting the fair value of these investments.  

 As of December 31, 2012, our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of $2.1 billion and are included in Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature and initial maturity.  

53 

 The following table summarizes our Fiduciary assets and non-fiduciary Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Share Repurchase Program  

 In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which up to $2 billion of common stock was authorized to be repurchased ("2010 Stock Repurchase Program"). Shares of common stock were authorized to be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured repurchase programs, from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and were funded from available capital. Any repurchased shares of common stock were available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes.  

 The 2010 Stock Repurchase Program, which related to common stock of Aon Corporation and preceded the Redomestication, did not extend to the shares of Aon plc. In April 2012, our Board of Directors therefore authorized a share repurchase program under which up to $5 billion of Class A Ordinary Shares may be repurchased ("2012 Share Repurchase Program"). Under this program, shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital.  

 During 2012, the Company repurchased 21.6 million shares at an average price per share of $52.16 for a total cost of $1.1 billion. The remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program is approximately $4.0 billion.  

 For information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2012, see Item 5  "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" as previously described.  

 Dividends  

 During 2012, 2011, and 2010, we paid dividends on our ordinary shares of $204 million, $200 million, and $175 million, respectively. Dividends paid per ordinary share were $0.62 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $0.60 for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  

 Redomestication  

 As a U.K. incorporated company, we must have "distributable reserves" to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company and, amongst other methods, through a reduction in share capital approved by the English Companies Court. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount. On April 4, 2012, we received approval from the English Companies Court to reduce our share  

54 

premium and in connection with that approval, recognized distributable reserves in the amount of $8.0 billion. As of December 31, 2012, we had distributable reserves of $7.0 billion.  

 Debt Securities  

 We use proceeds from the commercial paper market from time to time in order to meet short-term working capital needs. We had $50 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The weighted average commercial paper outstanding for 2012 and 2011 was $67 million and $35 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of the commercial paper outstanding during 2012 and 2011 was 0.41% and 0.35%, respectively.  

 On August 31, 2012, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt, securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and convertible securities. The availability of any potential liquidity for these types of securities is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors.  

 On December 12, 2012, we issued $166 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Notes Due 2042 in connection with an exchange offer of Aon Corporation's outstanding 8.205% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due January 2027. In connection with this exchange, the Company paid a premium of $59 million which will be amortized into Interest expense over the life of the new notes. Concurrently with the issuance, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement that gives the holders of the new notes certain exchange and registration rights.  

 Credit Facilities  

 At December 31, 2012, we have a five-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. ("U.S. Facility") that expires in 2017. The U.S. facility is for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support. Additionally, we have a five-year €650 million ($860 million at December 31, 2012 exchange rates) multi-currency European credit facility ("Euro Facility") available, which expires in October 2015. At December 31, 2012, we had no borrowings under either of the credit facilities.  

 For both our U.S. and Euro Facilities, the two most significant covenants require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted for Hewitt related transaction costs and up to $50 million in non-recurring cash charges ("Adjusted EBITDA") to consolidated interest expense and a ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA. For both facilities, the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense must be at least 4 to 1. For the Euro Facility, the ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA must not exceed 3 to 1. For the U.S. Facility, the ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA must not exceed the lower of (a) 3.25 to 1.00 or (b) the greater of (i) 3.00 to 1.00 or (ii) the lowest ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA then set forth in the Euro Facility or Aon's $450,000,000 Term Loan Facility. We were in compliance with these and all other covenants during 2012.  

55 

 Rating Agency Ratings  

 The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 22, 2013 appear in the table below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether.  

 Letters of Credit  

 We have total letters of credit ("LOCs") outstanding for approximately $74 million and $75 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These letters of credit cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions on our own workers compensation program. We have also issued LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at its international subsidiaries.  

 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources  

 We believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditures, pension contributions, cash restructuring costs, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1, "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors."  

 Contractual Obligations  

 Summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be   

56 

agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.    

(2)In 2007, our principal U.K subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £9.4 million ($15 million) per year to that pension plan for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by approximately 5% on each April 1. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2012, the estimated winding-up deficit was £260 million ($420 million). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid. 

(3)Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including what is to be purchased, at what price and the approximate timing of the transaction. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or for claims outsourcing in the U.K. 

(4)Excludes $74 million of unfunded commitments related to an investment in a limited partnership due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when the limited partnership will request funding. 

(5)Excludes $156 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements will be made.   

 Financial Condition  

 At December 31, 2012, our net assets of $7.8 billion, representing total assets minus total liabilities, were $315 million lower than the balance at December 31, 2011. The decrease is primarily related to share repurchases of $1.1 billion and dividends of $204 million, partially offset by net income of $1.0 billion. Working capital decreased $713 million to $1.0 billion, primarily due to a decrease in cash and short-term investments to fund share repurchases.  

 Borrowings  

 Total debt at December 31, 2012 was $4.2 billion, a decrease of $327 million from December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily related to debt repayments during the year (see Note 8 "Debt").  

 On March 20, 2012, we entered into the U.S. Facility. Borrowings under the U.S. Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either (a) the rate for eurodollar deposits as reflected on the applicable Reuters LIBOR01 page for the interest period relevant to such borrowing ("Eurodollar Rate"), plus the applicable margin or (b) the highest of (i) the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank as its prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5% and (iii) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the U.S. Facility may change depending on achievement of certain public debt ratings. The U.S. Facility has a maturity date of March 20, 2017. In conjunction with the Company entering into the U.S. Facility the prior revolving U.S. credit agreement dated December 4, 2009 was terminated.  

 Our total debt as a percentage of total capital attributable to Aon shareholders was 35.0% and 35.8% at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.  

57 

 Equity  

 Equity at December 31, 2012 was $7.8 billion, a decrease of $315 million from December 31, 2011. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in share repurchases to $1.1 billion in 2012, $204 million of dividends to shareholders, and an increase in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $240 million, offset by net income of $1.0 billion and stock compensation expense of $212 million.  

 Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $240 million since December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting the following:   

an increase in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $109 million, which was attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies;  

an increase of $358 million in the net underfunded position of our post-retirement benefit obligations due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the future benefit obligation; and  

net unrealized derivative gains of $9 million.   

 REVIEW BY SEGMENT  

 General  

 We serve clients through the following segments:   

Risk Solutions acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, via consultation, as well as negotiation and placement of insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.  

HR Solutions partners with organizations to solve their most complex benefits, talent and related financial challenges, and improve business performance by designing, implementing, communicating and administering a wide range of human capital, retirement, investment consulting, health care, compensation and talent management strategies.   

 Risk Solutions  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. During 2012 we began to see improvement in pricing on average globally; however, we would still consider this to be a "soft market," which began in 2007. In a soft market, premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. In 2012, pricing showed signs of stabilization and improvement in both our retail and reinsurance brokerage product lines and we expect this trend to slowly continue into 2013.  

 Additionally, beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2012, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the  

58 

deterioration of the financial markets. Weak global economic conditions have reduced our customers' demand for our retail brokerage products, which have had a negative impact on our operational results.  

 Risk Solutions generated approximately 66% of our consolidated total revenues in 2012. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients' policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.  

 We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, health care providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide products and services via GRIP Solutions; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide risk consulting, actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.  

 Revenue  

 Risk Solutions commissions, fees and other revenue were as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In 2012, commissions, fees and other revenue increased $109 million, or 1%, from 2011 driven primarily by 4% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth was driven primarily by strong growth in Asia and emerging markets, solid growth across Latin America and U.S. retail, as well as modest growth in continental Europe.  

59 

 Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other revenue growth for 2012 versus 2011 is as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Retail brokerage Commissions, fees and other revenue increased 1% driven by 3% growth in organic revenue in both the Americas and International operations and a 1% increase related to acquisitions, net of dispositions, partially offset by a 3% impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  

 Americas Commissions, fees and other revenue increased 2% reflecting 3% organic revenue growth driven by strong growth in Latin America and solid management of the renewal book portfolio across the region, partially offset by a 1% impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  

 International commissions, fees and other revenue was flat versus the prior year, driven by a 3% organic revenue increase primarily reflecting growth in Asia and emerging markets and a 1% impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  

 Reinsurance commissions, fees and other revenue increased 3% driven by 5% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue increased primarily resulting from strong growth in the global treaty business and a favorable market pricing impact in the near-term.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased $80 million, or 6%, from 2011 to $1.5 billion in 2012. In 2012, operating income margins in this segment were 19.6%, up 90 basis points from 18.7% in 2011. Operating margin improvement was primarily driven by revenue growth, reduced costs of restructuring initiatives and realization of the benefits of those restructuring plans, which was partially offset by the negative impact of expense increases related to investment in the business.  

 HR Solutions  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of Hewitt, one of the world's leading human resource consulting and outsourcing companies. Hewitt operates globally together with Aon's existing consulting and outsourcing operations under the Aon Hewitt brand. Hewitt's operating results are included in Aon's results of operations beginning October 1, 2010.  

60 

 Our HR Solutions segment generated approximately 34% of our consolidated total revenues in 2012 and provides a broad range of human capital services, as follows:   

Retirement specializes in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration.  

Compensation focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.  

Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change management.  

Investment consulting advises public and private companies, other institutions and trustees on developing and maintaining investment programs across a broad range of plan types, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, endowments and foundations.   

Benefits Administration applies our HR expertise primarily through defined benefit, defined contribution, and health and welfare administrative services. Our model replaces the resource-intensive processes once required to administer benefit plans with more efficient, effective, and less costly solutions.  

Exchanges is building and operating health care exchanges that provide employers with a cost effective alternative to traditional employee and retiree healthcare, while helping individuals select the insurance that best meets their needs.   

HR BPO provides market-leading solutions to manage employee data; administer benefits, payroll and other human resources processes; and record and manage talent, workforce and other core HR process transactions as well as other complementary services such as absence management, flexible spending, dependent audit and participant advocacy.   

 Beginning in late 2008, the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets created significant uncertainty in the marketplace. Weak economic conditions globally continued throughout 2012. The prolonged economic downturn is adversely impacting our clients' financial condition and therefore the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. While we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time, these challenges are reducing demand for some of our services and putting continued pressure on pricing of those services, which is having an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.  

 Revenue  

 Commissions, fees and other revenue were as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

61 

 Organic revenue growth in 2012, as detailed in the following reconciliation:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consulting services increased $39 million, or 3%, due primarily to organic revenue growth of 4%, driven by solid growth across all businesses with strength in investment consulting, pension administration services for certain project-related work, talent and rewards, and communication consulting, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  

 Outsourcing revenue increased $114 million, or 5%, due primarily to 5% organic revenue growth driven by client wins in the HR BPO business and growth in the health care exchanges were partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income was $289 million, a decrease of $47 million, or 14%, from 2011. This decrease was primarily driven by investments in long-term growth opportunities in the first half of 2012. Margins in this segment for 2012 were 7.4%, a decrease of 150 basis points from 8.9% in 2011 driven by the impact of investments in the business, higher intangible amortization expense related to the acquisition of Hewitt, and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by organic revenue growth and the realization of the benefits of those restructuring plans and operational improvement.  

 Unallocated Income and Expense  

 A reconciliation of our operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments. Net unallocated expenses increased $33 million to $186 million from $153 million in 2011, driven primarily by an increase in costs of $21 million related to the relocation of the Company's headquarters to London.  

62 

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income decreased $8 million, or 44%, from 2011, due to a lower average rate and lower cash balances.  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, decreased $17 million, or 7%, from 2011 due to a decrease in the amount of debt outstanding for the full year.  

 Other income (expense) of $3 million in 2012 includes gains on certain long-term investments and Company owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses due to the unfavourable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Additionally, 2011 includes death benefits on certain Company owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses and write-offs related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds and other long-term investments and a $19 million loss on the extinguishment of debt.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  

 In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Revenue Recognition  

 Risk Solutions segment revenues include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable. The Company generally considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client, there is a fixed or determinable price, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured. For brokerage commissions, revenue is typically considered to be earned and realized or realizable at the completion of the placement process, assuming all other criteria required to recognize revenue have been met. The placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy. Commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the Company has sufficient information to conclude the amount due is determinable, which may not occur until cash is received from the insurance carrier. Investment income is typically recognized as funds for clients are physically held by the company are bearing interest that is deemed probable of collection.  

 HR Solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts. Fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed, assuming all other criteria for recognizing revenue have been met. Revenues from fixed-fee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportional-performance  

63 

model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues. The Company's outsourcing contracts typically have three-to-five year terms for benefits services and five-to-ten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing ("HR BPO") services. The Company recognizes revenues as services are performed, assuming all other criteria for recognizing revenue have been met. The Company may also receive implementation fees from clients either up-front or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant. Lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period. If a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract, a loss on the contract may be recorded, if necessary, and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date.  

 In connection with the Company's long-term outsourcing service agreements, highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the Company's systems and operating processes. For outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting, specific, incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized. Deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis, to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue.  

 Restructuring  

 Workforce reduction costs  

 The method used to recognize workforce reduction costs depends on whether the benefits are provided under a one-time benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement. We account for relevant expenses as an ongoing benefit arrangement when we have an established termination benefit policy, statutory requirements dictate the termination benefit amounts, or we have an established pattern of providing similar termination benefits. The method to estimate the amount of termination benefits is based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated.  

 We recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from an ongoing benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated and notify the employees.  

 We recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from a one-time benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees receive incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we recognize the cost of their termination benefits over the remaining service period.  

 Lease termination costs  

 Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss and corresponding liability. The liability reflects our best estimate of the fair value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss and corresponding liability, we estimate sublease income based on all information that is reasonably available, which typically includes current market quotes for similar properties.  

64 

 Useful lives on leasehold improvements or other assets associated with lease abandonments may be revised to reflect a shorter useful life than originally estimated, which results in accelerated depreciation.  

 Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses  

 Accounting guidance requires that the liabilities recorded related to our restructuring activities be measured at fair value.  

 Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their present value. Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time and therefore no discounting is necessary. However, we may discount the termination benefit arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.  

 Other associated costs with restructuring activities  

 We recognize other costs associated with restructuring activities as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.  

 Pensions  

 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada. Our U.S., U.K. and Canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our U.S., U.K. and Canadian plans.  

 Recognition of gains and losses and prior service  

 We defer the recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and plan asset performance.  

 Unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the Netherlands and Canada, or the average life expectancy of the U.S. and U.K. plan members. After the effective date of the plan amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service, unrecognized gains and losses are also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the Canadian plans. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.  

 As of December 31, 2012, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.  

65 

 The following table discloses our combined experience loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2013 amortization of loss by country (amounts in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The unrecognized prior service cost at December 31, 2012 was $29 million in the U.K. and non-U.S. plans.  

 For the U.S. pension plans we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year's value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2012, the market-related value of assets was $1.6 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position which is based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of plan assets was $1.6 billion.  

 Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.  

 Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation  

 The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:

(1)Includes investments in infrastructure, real estate, limited partnerships and hedge funds.   

 In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.  

 The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The actual asset allocation at December 31, 2012 was 65% equity and 35% fixed income securities for the qualified plan.  

 The investment policy for each U.K. and non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans' trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and non-U.S. category,  

66 

our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change. As of December 31, 2012, the U.K. and non-U.S. plans were invested between 35% and 59% in equity and between 41% and 65% in fixed income securities.  

 Impact of changing economic assumptions  

 Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.  

 Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our net underfunded status at December 31, 2012 (in millions):

 Estimated future contributions  

 We estimate contributions of approximately $548 million in 2013 as compared with $638 million in 2012.  

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either trademarks, customer relationships, technology, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles.  

 Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued final guidance that gives an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may eliminate the requirement to  

67 

perform the annual two-step test. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we also test the acquired tradenames (which also are not amortized) for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2012 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames.  

 We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.  

 The goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, including goodwill, of the corresponding reporting unit. If the "more likely than not" threshold is not met, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.  

 In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2012 and 2011, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.  

 We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2012. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.

 Contingencies  

 We define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one ore more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when it is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.  

 Share-based Payments  

 Share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

 Share Option Accounting  

 We generally use a lattice-binomial option-pricing model to value share options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options, and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our share price and the implied volatility of traded options on our shares.  

 In terms of the assumptions used in the lattice-based model, we:   

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model. We stratify employees between those receiving Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP") options, Special Share Plan options, and all other option grants. We believe that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns,  

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate, and   

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   

 The expected life of employee share options represents the weighted-average period share options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.  

 Restricted Share Units  

 Restricted share units ("RSUs") are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant.  

 Performance Share Awards  

 Performance share awards ("PSAs") are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.  

 PSAs may immediately vest at the end of the performance period or may have an additional service period. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance or additional service period,  

69 

whichever is longer. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.  

 The largest performance-based share-based payment award plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. The 2010 to 2012 performance period ended on December 31, 2012, the 2009 to 2011 performance period ended on December 31, 2011, and the 2008 to 2010 performance period ended on December 31, 2010. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2011 to 2013 and 2012 to 2014. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both LPP plans would have increased our 2012 expense by approximately $5.3 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $5.3 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 We earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. The estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item, such as the resolution of prior-year tax matters.  

 The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management's assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.  

 Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.  

 We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a "more likely than not" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Additional U.S. income taxes could be recorded (or incurred) if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.  

 We base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.  

 We operate in many jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance, when available, and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:   

the portion of our overall operations conducted in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue,   

70 

to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct global operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities,  

tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes, and  

the move of the corporate headquarters to London.
