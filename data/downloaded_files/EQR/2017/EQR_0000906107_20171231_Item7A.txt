Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the refinancing of its long-term debt and floating interest rate instruments that include its unsecured revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, floating rate tax-exempt debt and fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. These exposures to interest rates are primarily driven by changes in long-term U.S. Treasury rates for refinancing activity, changes in short-term LIBOR borrowing rates and the SIFMA index for floating rate debt and changes in commercial paper market conditions. The Company evaluates various factors including its total debt, the current and future anticipated economic environment and other factors to manage this risk. We generally hedge a portion of future long-term debt issuances and target a level of floating rate debt of 20% or less depending upon market conditions. To the extent the Company carries substantial cash balances, this will tend to partially counterbalance any changes in interest rates.  

The Company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk. Derivatives are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See also Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments. 

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments (including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities) approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature, terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates. The fair value of the Company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt (including its commercial paper and line of credit, if applicable) were approximately $3.6 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2017.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.4 billion, or 15.4% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 16 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.2 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 16 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.2 million. 

At December 31, 2017, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $7.6 billion, or 84.6% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 47 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $6.9 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 47 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $8.5 billion. 

At December 31, 2017, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately $3.5 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $7.7 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net liability fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $0.7 million. 

At December 31, 2016, the Company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately $1.1 billion, or 12.3% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 11 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.3 million. If market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 11 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.3 million. 

At December 31, 2016, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately $7.9 billion, or 87.7% of total debt, net of the effects of any derivative instruments. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 49 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $7.2 billion. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 49 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately $8.8 billion. 

At December 31, 2016, the Company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately $1.9 million. If market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points (a 10% increase from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $0.4 million. If market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points (a 10% decrease from the Company’s existing weighted average interest rates), the net asset fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments would be approximately $3.4 million. 

These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company’s financial instruments. The foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the Company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company’s financial structure or results. 

The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long-term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.
