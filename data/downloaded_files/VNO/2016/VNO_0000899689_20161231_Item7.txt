PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.7% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2016.  

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be named JBG SMITH Properties. Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company. The pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata 1:2 basis. The initial Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction. JBG has obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this transaction. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be completed.  

We currently own all or portions of: 

New York: 

· 20.2 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 36 properties; 

· 2.7 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 70 properties; 

· 2,004 units in twelve residential properties; 

· The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33rd Street in the heart of the Penn Plaza district; 

· A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building; 

Washington, DC: 

· 11.1 million square feet of office space in 44 properties; 

· 3,156 units in nine residential properties; 

Other Real Estate and Related Investments: 

· The 3.7 million square foot Mart (“theMART”) in Chicago; 

· A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating 1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center; 

· A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate fund. We are the general partner and investment manager of the fund; 

· A 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”); and  

· Other real estate and other investments.  

7  

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through: 

· maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. 

ACQUISITIONS 

There were no significant acquisitions during 2016.  

DISPOSITIONS 

On May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street for net proceeds of $127.4 million. 

On August 24, 2016, the Skyline properties, located in Fairfax, Virginia, were placed in receivership. On December 21, 2016, the final disposition of the Skyline properties was completed by the receiver. In connection therewith, the Skyline properties’ assets (approximately $236.5 million) and liabilities (approximately $724.4 million), were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $487.9 million. There was no taxable income related to this transaction. 

On December 19, 2016, we sold a 20% ownership interest in Fairfax Square for $15.5 million. 

FINANCINGS 

We completed the following financing transactions during 2016:  

· $900 million refinancing of 280 Park Avenue (50% owned); 

· $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway for net proceeds of approximately $330 million; 

· $675 million refinancing of theMART for net proceeds of approximately $124 million; 

· $400 million refinancing of 350 Park Avenue for net proceeds of approximately $111 million; 

· $300 million refinancing of One Park Avenue (55% owned); 

· $300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street (53% owned as of May 27, 2016); 

· $273 million refinancing of The Warner Building (55% owned); 

· $ 80 million refinancing of 50-70 West 93rd Street (49.9% owned); and 

· $247 million redemption of all of the outstanding 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares 

We also extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities to February 2021 with two six-month extension options, lowering the interest rate from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The facility fee remains unchanged at 20 basis points.

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet on our 220 Central Park South development site. The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion, of which $609,420,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016. 

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building at 512 West 22nd Street, along the western edge of the High Line in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% owned). The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $130,000,000, of which our share is $72,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $30,143,000 has been expended, of which our share is $16,579,000. 

We are developing a 170,000 square foot office and retail building at 61 Ninth Avenue, located on the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan. In February 2016, the venture purchased an adjacent five story loft building and air rights in exchange for a 10% common and preferred equity interest in the venture valued at $19,400,000, which reduced our ownership interest to 45.1% from 50.1%. On December 21, 2016, the venture obtained a $90,000,000 construction loan. The loan matures in December 2020 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 3.05%. As of December 31, 2016, there was nothing drawn on this loan. The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $150,000,000, of which our share is $68,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $38,499,000 has been expended, of which our share is $17,363,000. 

We are developing a 34,000 square foot office and retail building at 606 Broadway, located on the northeast corner of Broadway and Houston Street in Manhattan (50.0% owned). At closing, the joint venture obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year extension options. The venture’s incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $60,000,000, of which our share is $30,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $20,833,000 has been expended, of which our share is $10,417,000. 

We are in the process of demolishing two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street, and will replace them in the future with a new 335,000 square foot Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street. The incremental development cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $170,000,000, of which $10,500,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016. 

In September 2016, a joint venture between the Related Companies and Vornado was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of office space and ancillary train hall retail. The joint venture will enter into a 99-year, triple-net lease and make a $230,000,000 contribution towards the construction of the train hall. Total costs for the redevelopment of the office and retail space are yet to be determined. 

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, including, in particular, the Penn Plaza District. 

There can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.

SEGMENT DATA 

We operate in the following business segments: New York and Washington, DC. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in Note 23 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year.  

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

Certain Activities 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by Vornado’s Board of Trustees without the vote of our shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately 4,225 employees, of which 284 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,265 employees, including 2,634 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 459 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC segment and theMART properties have 456 and 220 employees, respectively. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities. 

principal executive offices 

Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019; telephone (212) 894‑7000.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Material factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below. We refer to the equity and debt securities of both Vornado and the Operating Partnership as our “securities” and the investors who own shares or units, or both, as our “equity holders.” The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. See “Forward-Looking Statements” contained herein on page 6. 

Real Estate Investments’ Value and Income Fluctuate Due to Various Factors. 

The value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.  

The factors that affect the value of our real estate investments include, among other things: 

· global, national, regional and local economic conditions; 

· competition from other available space; 

· local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; 

· how well we manage our properties; 

· the development and/or redevelopment of our properties; 

· changes in market rental rates;  

· the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals; 

· whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants; 

· changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;  

· whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive; 

· changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment; 

· the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults; 

· availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all; 

· inflation or deflation; 

· fluctuations in interest rates; 

· our ability to obtain adequate insurance;  

· changes in zoning laws and taxation; 

· government regulation;  

· consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attacks against, the United States or individual acts of violence in public spaces including retail centers; 

· potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;  

· natural disasters; 

· general competitive factors; and 

· climate changes. 

The rents or sales proceeds we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If rental revenues, sales proceeds and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to equity holders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.  

Capital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of our debt and equity securities. 

There are many factors that can affect the value of our debt and equity securities, including the state of the capital markets and the economy. Demand for office and retail space may decline nationwide, as it did in 2008 and 2009 due to the economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants. Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. 

11  

Real estate is a competitive business. 

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. 

We depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay. 

Our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a majority of our income comes from renting of real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and funds available for distribution to equity holders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. During periods of economic adversity, there may be an increase in the number of tenants that cannot pay their rent and an increase in vacancy rates. 

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire. 

When our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to equity holders could be adversely affected. 

Bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenue, net income and available cash. 

From time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in decreased revenue, net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to equity holders. 

We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate. 

Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. Our predecessor companies may be subject to similar liabilities for activities of those companies in the past. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties. 

Each of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us. 

12  

In addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a “carbon tax”). These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to equity holders. 

We face risks associated with our tenants being designated “Prohibited Persons” by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements.  

Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (“Prohibited Persons”) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of such agreements. If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows. 

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.  

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. 

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results. 

We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  

A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  

13  

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.  

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.  

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,622,000 ($1,976,000 for 2017) and 16% (17% for 2017) of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.  

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio. 

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.  

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel. From time to time persons have asserted claims against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA, but to date such claims have not resulted in any material expense or liability. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to equity holders. 

Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

OUR INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED CURRENTLY IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA AND WASHINGTON, DC/NORTHERN VIRGINIA AREA AND CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THESE AREAS GENERALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. UPON COMPLETION OF OUR PROPOSED SPIN-OFF OF OUR WASHINGTON, DC SEGMENT, OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS WILL BE LESS DIVERSIFIED AND MORE CONCENTRATED IN THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA. 

A significant portion of our properties are located currently in the New York City/New Jersey metropolitan area and Washington, DC/Northern Virginia area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent to those areas. 

In 2016, approximately 91% of our EBITDA, as adjusted, came from properties located in the New York City metropolitan area and the Washington, DC/Northern Virginia area. We may continue to concentrate a significant portion of our future acquisitions in these areas or in other geographic real estate markets in the United States or abroad. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact these markets in either the short or long term. Declines in the economy or declines in real estate markets in these areas could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in these regions include: 

· financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries; 

· with respect to our Washington, DC segment, space needs of, and budgetary constraints affecting, the United States Government, including the effect of a deficit reduction plan and/or base closures and repositioning under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005, as amended; 

· business layoffs or downsizing; 

· industry slowdowns; 

· relocations of businesses; 

· changing demographics; 

· increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places; 

· changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including, as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies); 

· infrastructure quality; and 

· any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate. 

Assuming we complete the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment as expected, our real estate investments will be more concentrated in New York City and less diversified than prior to the spin-off. After giving effect to the spin-off and assuming it was completed as of January 1, 2016, 89% of our EBITDA, as adjusted, came from properties located in the New York City metropolitan area. 

It is impossible for us to assess the future effects of trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic areas in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in these areas. Local, national or global economic downturns, would negatively affect our businesses and profitability. 

Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City and the Washington, DC area, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow. 

We have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas. In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas. This, in turn, would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially. 

Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the areas where we operate and could adversely impact our results. 

Our investments are concentrated in the New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Natural disasters, including earthquakes, storms and hurricanes, could impact our properties in these and other areas in which we operate. Potentially adverse consequences of “global warming” could similarly have an impact on our properties. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance and to the risk of business interruption. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.  

15  

We May Acquire or Sell Assets or Entities or Develop Properties. Our Failure or Inability to Consummate These Transactions or Manage the Results of These Transactions Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results. 

We may acquire, develop or redevelop real estate and acquire related companies and this may create risks. 

We may acquire, develop or redevelop properties or acquire real estate related companies when we believe doing so is consistent with our business strategy. We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring real estate and real estate related companies; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs. Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management’s attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties or companies acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.  

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions. The announcement of such a material acquisition may result in a rapid and significant decline in the price of our securities. 

We are continuously looking at material transactions that we believe will maximize shareholder value. However, an announcement by us of one or more significant acquisitions could result in a quick and significant decline in the price of our securities. 

It may be difficult to buy and sell real estate quickly, which may limit our flexibility. 

Real estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. 

We may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the debt associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. In addition, when we dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn similar returns. 

As part of an acquisition of a property, or a portfolio of properties, we may agree, and in the past have agreed, not to dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness for a long-term period, unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the seller. These agreements could result in us holding on to properties that we would otherwise sell and not pay down or refinance. In addition, when we dispose of or sell assets, we may not be able to reinvest the sales proceeds and earn returns similar to those generated by the assets that were sold. 

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies operate in industries with different risks than investing and operating real estate. 

From time to time we have made, and in the future we may seek to make, investments in companies that we may not control, including, but not limited to, Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”), Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”), Urban Edge Properties (“UE”), Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (“PREIT”), and other equity and loan investments. Although these businesses generally have a significant real estate component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from investing and operating real estate, including operating or managing toy stores. Consequently, we are subject to operating and financial risks of those industries and to the risks associated with lack of control, such as having differing objectives than our partners or the entities in which we invest, or becoming involved in disputes, or competing directly or indirectly with these partners or entities. In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.  

We are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments. 

Certain of our properties are Manhattan street retail properties. As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, change in relative strengths of world currencies, the threat of terrorism, increasing competition from retailers, outlet malls, retail websites and catalog companies and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, and in turn, adversely affect us. 

16  

Our investment in Toys has in the past and may in the future result in increased seasonality and volatility in our reported earnings. 

We carry our Toys investment at zero. As a result, we no longer record our equity in Toys' income or loss. Because Toys is a retailer, its operations subject us to the risks of a retail company that are different than those presented by our other lines of business. The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys net income is generated in its fourth quarter. It is possible that the value of Toys may increase and we could again resume recording our equity in Toys' income or loss, which would increase the seasonality and volatility of our reported earnings. 

Our decision to dispose of real estate assets would change the holding period assumption in our valuation analyses, which could result in material impairment losses and adversely affect our financial results. 

We evaluate real estate assets for impairment based on the projected cash flow of the asset over our anticipated holding period. If we change our intended holding period, due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset, then under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must reevaluate whether that asset is impaired. Depending on the carrying value of the property at the time we change our intention and the amount that we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss that would adversely affect our financial results. This loss could be material to our results of operations in the period that it is recognized.  

We invest in marketable equity securities. The value of these investments may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.  

We invest in marketable equity securities of publicly-traded companies, such as Lexington. As of December 31, 2016, our marketable securities have an aggregate carrying amount of $203,704,000, at market. Significant declines in the value of these investments due to, among other reasons, operating performance or economic or market conditions, may result in the recognition of impairment losses which could be material.  

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-off.  

Although we believe that separating our Washington, DC segment will provide benefits to us and our shareholders, the spin-off may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and neither we nor JBG SMITH may realize the intended benefits of the spin-off. In addition, we will incur one-time costs in connection with the spin-off that may exceed our estimates and negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve. Further, if the proposed spin-off is completed, our operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the Washington, DC segment from us. As a result, our diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility. 

17  

Our Organizational and Financial Structure Gives Rise to Operational and Financial Risks. 

We may not be able to obtain capital to make investments. 

We depend primarily on external financing to fund the growth of our business. This is because one of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for a REIT is that it distributes 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders. This, in turn, requires the Operating Partnership to make distributions to its unitholders. There is a separate requirement to distribute net capital gains or pay a corporate level tax in lieu thereof. Our access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. Although we believe that we will be able to finance any investments we may wish to make in the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that new financing will be available or available on acceptable terms. For information about our available sources of funds, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We depend on dividends and distributions from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors and preferred equity holders of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us. 

Substantially all of Vornado’s assets are held through its Operating Partnership that holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of Vornado’s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of each of Vornado’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership’s ability to make distributions to its equity holders depends on its subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to the Operating Partnership. Likewise, Vornado’s ability to pay dividends to its holders of common and preferred shares depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to Vornado. 

Furthermore, the holders of preferred units of the Operating Partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to the Operating Partnership’s equity holders, including Vornado. Thus, Vornado’s ability to pay cash dividends to its equity holders and satisfy its debt obligations depends on the Operating Partnership’s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions to holders of its preferred units and then to its equity holders, including Vornado. As of December 31, 2016, there were four series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership not held by Vornado with a total liquidation value of $56,047,000. 

In addition, Vornado’s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred equity holders, are satisfied. 

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.  

As of December 31, 2016, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium, discount and deferred financing costs, net, totaled $10.7 billion. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. 

18  

We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms. 

We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. In addition, the cost of our existing debt may increase, especially in the case of a rising interest rate environment, and we may not be able to refinance our existing debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. If the cost or amount of our indebtedness increases or we cannot refinance our debt in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we are at risk of credit ratings downgrades and default on our obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Covenants in our debt instruments could adversely affect our financial condition and our acquisitions and development activities. 

The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured indebtedness and debt that we may obtain in the future may contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt based upon the level of our ratio of total debt to total assets, our ratio of secured debt to total assets, our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, and fixed charges, and that require us to maintain a certain level of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our ability to borrow is subject to compliance with these and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with our covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or give possession of a secured property to the lender. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms. 

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.  

Our credit rating and the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and our preferred shares could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant such action. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our common shares or any other securities. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a “watch list” for a possible downgrading or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of funding, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders. 

Vornado may fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT and may be required to pay income taxes at corporate rates. 

Although we believe that Vornado will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, Vornado may fail to remain so qualified. Qualifications are governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depend on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, Vornado fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT and does not qualify under statutory relief provisions, Vornado could not deduct distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If Vornado had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to equity holders and pay its indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and Vornado would not be required to make distributions to shareholders in that taxable year and in future years until it was able to qualify as a REIT. In addition, Vornado would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless Vornado were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions.  

We face possible adverse changes in tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. 

From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. The shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends and distributions. 

19  

Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common shares and Operating Partnership Class A units. 

We are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. While we believe that we could find a replacement for him and other key personnel, the loss of their services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our securities. 

Vornado’s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us. 

Vornado’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (the “declaration of trust”) sets limits on the ownership of its shares. 

Generally, for Vornado to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of Vornado may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of Vornado’s taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code defines “individuals” for purposes of the requirement described in the preceding sentence to include some types of entities. Under Vornado’s declaration of trust, as amended, no person may own more than 6.7% of the outstanding common shares of any class, or 9.9% of the outstanding preferred shares of any class, with some exceptions for persons who held common shares in excess of the 6.7% limit before Vornado adopted the limit and other persons approved by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. These restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of equity holders. 

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) contains provisions that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.  

The MGCL imposes conditions and restrictions on certain “business combinations” (including, among other transactions, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance of equity securities) between a Maryland REIT and certain persons who beneficially own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock (an “interested shareholder”). Unless approved in advance by the board of trustees of the trust, or otherwise exempted by the statute, such a business combination is prohibited for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. After such five-year period, a business combination with an interested shareholder must be: (a) recommended by the board of trustees of the trust, and (b) approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80% of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote and (ii) two-thirds of the trust’s outstanding shares entitled to vote which are not held by the interested shareholder with whom the business combination is to be effected, unless, among other things, the trust’s common shareholders receive a “fair price” (as defined by the statute) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for his or her shares. 

In approving a transaction, Vornado’s Board of Trustees may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board of Trustees. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination between Vornado and any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates. As a result, any trustee or officer of Vornado or its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with Vornado that may not be in the best interest of our equity holders. With respect to business combinations with other persons, the business combination provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Vornado and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. 

Until 2019, Vornado has a classified Board of Trustees and that may reduce the likelihood of certain takeover transactions. 

Vornado’s Board of Trustees is divided currently into three classes of trustees. Commencing this year, each class of trustees that is up for election will be elected for a one-year term with all trustees forming a single class elected annually commencing in 2019. Historically trustees of each class have been chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of Vornado, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our equity holders. 

20  

Vornado may issue additional shares in a manner that could adversely affect the likelihood of certain takeover transactions.  

Vornado’s declaration of trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to: 

· cause Vornado to issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares; 

· classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred shares; 

· set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified shares that Vornado issues; and 

· increase, without shareholder approval, the number of shares of beneficial interest that Vornado may issue. 

Vornado’s Board of Trustees could establish a series of preferred shares whose terms could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado, and therefore of the Operating Partnership, or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders, although Vornado’s Board of Trustees does not now intend to establish a series of preferred shares of this kind. Vornado’s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Vornado or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our equity holders. 

We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our equity holders. 

Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other companies, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization, dividends and distributions, are exclusively determined by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. Accordingly, our equity holders do not control these policies. 

Our Ownership Structure and Related-Party Transactions May Give Rise to Conflicts of Interest. 

Steven Roth and Interstate Properties may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of Vornado’s other trustees and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us. 

As of December 31, 2016, Interstate Properties, a New Jersey general partnership, and its partners owned an aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of Vornado and 26.3% of the common stock of Alexander’s, which is described below. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the three partners of Interstate Properties. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of Vornado and also Directors of Alexander’s.  

Because of these overlapping interests, Mr. Roth and Interstate Properties and its partners may have substantial influence over Vornado, and therefore over the Operating Partnership, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Vornado’s shareholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate Properties and our other equity holders. In addition, Mr. Roth, Interstate Properties and its partners, and Alexander’s currently and may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities. 

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate Properties under a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. See Note 21 – Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  

There may be conflicts of interest between Alexander’s and us. 

As of December 31, 2016, we owned 32.4% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s. Alexander’s is a REIT that has seven properties, which are located in the greater New York metropolitan area. In addition to the 2.3% that they indirectly own through Vornado, Interstate Properties, which is described above, and its partners owned 26.3% of the outstanding common stock of Alexander’s as of December 31, 2016. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Office of Vornado, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. Messrs. Wight and Mandelbaum are Trustees of Vornado and also Directors of Alexander’s and general partners of Interstate Properties. Dr. Richard West is a Trustee of Vornado and a Director of Alexander’s. In addition, Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Administrative Officer, is the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Alexander’s, and Stephen W. Theriot, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Assistant Treasurer of Alexander’s. 

21  

We manage, develop and lease Alexander’s properties under management and development agreements and leasing agreements under which we receive annual fees from Alexander’s. See Note 21 – Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  

The Number of Shares of Vornado Realty Trust and the Market for Those Shares Give Rise to Various Risks. 

The trading price of Vornado’s common shares has been volatile and may fluctuate.  

The trading price of Vornado’s common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of Vornado’s common shares and the redemption price of the Operating Partnership’s Class A units. Among those factors are:  

· our financial condition and performance; 

· the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults; 

· actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition; 

· our dividend policy; 

· the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities; 

· uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets; 

· fluctuations in interest rates; 

· changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs; 

· failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates; 

· speculation in the press or investment community;  

· strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;  

· the extent of institutional investor interest in us; 

· the extent of short-selling of Vornado common shares and the shares of our competitors;  

· fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;  

· general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;  

· domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and  

· all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K.  

A significant decline in Vornado’s stock price could result in substantial losses for our equity holders. 

Vornado has many shares available for future sale, which could hurt the market price of its shares and the redemption price of the Operating Partnership’s units. 

The interests of equity holders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2016, Vornado had authorized but unissued, 60,899,124 common shares of beneficial interest, $.04 par value and 67,116,023 preferred shares of beneficial interest, no par value; of which 19,538,084 common shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of Class A Operating Partnership units, convertible securities and employee stock options and 11,200,000 preferred shares are reserved for issuance upon redemption of preferred Operating Partnership units. Any shares not reserved may be issued from time to time in public or private offerings or in connection with acquisitions. In addition, common and preferred shares reserved may be sold upon issuance in the public market after registration under the Securities Act or under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or other available exemptions from registration. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of Vornado’s common and preferred shares or Operating Partnership Class A and preferred units will have on the market prices of our securities. 

In addition, under Maryland law, Vornado’s Board of Trustees has the authority to increase the number of authorized shares without shareholder approval.

New York  

As of December 31, 2016, our New York segment consisted of 28.3 million square feet in 86 properties. The 28.3 million square feet is comprised of 20.2 million square feet of office space in 36 properties, 2.7 million square feet of retail space in 70 properties, 2,004 units in twelve residential properties, the 1.4 million square foot Hotel Pennsylvania, and our 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area. The New York segment also includes 11 garages totaling 1.7 million square feet (4,970 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties. 

New York lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 20 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step‑ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants their share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base year. Electricity is provided to tenants on a sub-metered basis or included in rent based on surveys and adjusted for subsequent utility rate increases. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises. 

As of December 31, 2016, the occupancy rate for our New York segment was 96.5%.

Washington, DC  

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be named JBG SMITH Properties. Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company. The pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata 1:2 basis. The initial Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction. JBG has obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this transaction. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be completed.  

On August 24, 2016, the Skyline properties, located in Fairfax, Virginia, were placed in receivership. On December 21, 2016, the final disposition of the Skyline properties was completed by the receiver. In connection therewith, the Skyline properties’ assets (approximately $236,535,000) and liabilities (approximately $724,412,000), were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $487,877,000. There was no taxable income related to this transaction. 

On December 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our 20% interest in Fairfax Square to our joint venture partner for $15,500,000, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $15,302,000.

The Washington, DC segment also includes 45 garages totaling approximately 7.0 million square feet (22,110 spaces) which are managed by, or leased to, third parties.  

Washington, DC office lease terms generally range from five to seven years for smaller tenants to as long as 15 years for major tenants, and may provide for extension options at either pre-negotiated or market rates. Leases typically provide for periodic step-ups in rent over the term of the lease and pass through to tenants, the tenants’ share of increases in real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses over a base year. Periodic step-ups in rent are usually based upon fixed percentage increases. Leases also typically provide for free rent and tenant improvement allowances for all or a portion of the tenant’s initial construction costs of its premises.

 (1)  FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Overview 

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.7% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2016. All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.  

On October 31, 2016, Vornado’s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our Washington, DC segment and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new company, which will be named JBG SMITH Properties. Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a member of the Board of Trustees of the new company. The pro rata distribution to Vornado common shareholders and Class A Operating Partnership unitholders is intended to be treated as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be made on a pro rata 1:2 basis. The initial Form 10 registration statement relating to the spin-off and merger was filed with the SEC on January 23, 2017 and the distribution and combination are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. The distribution and combination are subject to certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the Form 10 registration statement effective, filing and approval of the new company’s listing application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents by each of the Company and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution by Vornado’s Board of Trustees. The distribution and combination are not subject to a vote by Vornado’s shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. Vornado’s Board of Trustees has approved the transaction. JBG has obtained all requisite approvals from its investment funds for this transaction. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be completed.  

We own and operate office and retail properties with large concentrations in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC/Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, a 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) as well as interests in other real estate and related investments. 

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2016: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

40  

Overview – continued 

We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through: 

· maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. 

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Overview – continued 

Washington, DC Segment 

Excluding the Skyline Properties which were disposed of on December 21, 2016, our Washington, DC segment EBITDA as adjusted was $290,500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is flat to 2015 as a result of an increase in EBITDA from the core business of $3,100,000, offset by a decline in EBITDA from properties taken out-of-service of $3,100,000. These results are slightly ahead of the guidance we published for 2016.  

We expect to complete the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment in the second quarter of 2017. We expect that Washington, DC’s EBITDA as adjusted during the first half of 2017 will be lower than the first half of 2016 by approximately $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, comprised of: 

(i) core business approximately $2,000,000 to $6,000,000 higher than 2016, offset by, 

(ii) reduction in EBITDA of approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 from 1700 M Street, 1800 South Bell and 1750 Crystal Drive being taken out-of-service for redevelopment.  

Investments 

On March 17, 2016, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 33.3% interest, which owns a $150,000,000 mezzanine loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.88% and an initial maturity date in November 2016, with two three-month extension options. On November 9, 2016, the mezzanine loan was extended to May 2017 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 9.42% (10.08% at December 31, 2016) during the extension period. As of December 31, 2016, the joint venture has fully funded its commitments. The joint venture’s investment is subordinate to $350,000,000 of third party debt. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method. 

On May 20, 2016, we contributed $19,650,000 for a 50.0% equity interest in a joint venture that will develop 606 Broadway, a 34,000 square foot office and retail building, located on Houston Street in Manhattan. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $104,000,000. At closing, the joint venture obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year extension options. Because this joint venture is a VIE and we determined we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture from the date of our investment. 

Dispositions 

On May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street, a 479,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon, and retained the remaining 53% interest. This transaction was based on a property value of approximately $561,000,000 or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of $127,382,000 from the sale and realized a net gain of $203,324,000, of which $159,511,000 was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 and is included in “net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” in our consolidated statements of income. The remaining net gain of $43,813,000 has been deferred until our guarantee of payment of loan principal and interest is removed or the loan is repaid. We realized a net tax gain of $90,017,000. We continue to manage and lease the property. We share control over major decisions with our joint venture partner. Accordingly, this property is accounted for under the equity method from the date of sale. 

On December 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our 20% interest in Fairfax Square to our joint venture partner for $15,500,000, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $15,302,000. 

On August 24, 2016, the Skyline properties, located in Fairfax, Virginia, were placed in receivership. On December 21, 2016, the final disposition of the Skyline properties was completed by the receiver. In connection therewith, the Skyline properties’ assets (approximately $236,535,000) and liabilities (approximately $724,412,000), were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $487,877,000. There was no taxable income related to this transaction.

Financings 

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 

On November 7, 2016, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from June 2017 to February 2021 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The facility fee remains unchanged at 20 basis points. 

Secured Debt 

On February 8, 2016, we completed a $700,000,000 refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75% (2.40% at December 31, 2016), which was swapped for four and a half years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $330,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in March 2016. 

On May 16, 2016, we completed a $300,000,000 recourse financing of 7 West 34th Street. The ten-year loan is interest only at a fixed rate of 3.65% and matures in June 2026. 

On September 6, 2016, we completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of theMART, a 3,652,000 square foot commercial building in Chicago. The five-year loan is interest only and has a fixed rate of 2.70%. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $124,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.57%, $550,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in December 2016. 

On December 2, 2016, we completed a $400,000,000 refinancing of 350 Park Avenue, a 571,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The ten-year loan is interest only and has a fixed rate of 3.92%. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $111,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 3.75%, $284,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in January 2017. 

Preferred Securities 

On September 1, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units at their redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, or $246,250,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption. In connection therewith, we expensed $7,408,000 of issuance costs, which reduced net income attributable to common shareholders and net income attributable to Class A unitholders in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. These costs had been initially recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity and partners’ capital.

Critical Accounting Policies  

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Real Estate 

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.  

Upon the acquisition of real estate that meets the criteria of a business under ASU 2017-01, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. 

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.8 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $192,731,000 and $227,901,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $263,786,000 and $318,148,000, respectively. 

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Critical Accounting Policies – continued 

Partially Owned Entities 

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and whether we are the primary beneficiary. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. 

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results.  

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($10,920,000 and $11,908,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($2,227,000 and $2,751,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  

52  

Critical Accounting Policies – continued 

Revenue Recognition 

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: 

· Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  

· Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved). 

· Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. 

· Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred. 

· Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is recognized in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. 

· Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. 

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectability. If our assessment of the collectability of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.  

Income Taxes 

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Interest and Other Investment Income, net 

Interest and other investment income, net was $29,546,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $26,978,000 in the prior year, an increase of $2,568,000. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in the value of investments in our deferred compensation plan (offset by a corresponding decrease in the liability for plan assets in general and administrative expenses). 

Interest and Debt Expense 

Interest and debt expense was $402,674,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $378,025,000 in the prior year, an increase of $24,649,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $23,205,000 of higher interest expense from the full year effect of 2015 financings of the St. Regis Retail, 150 West 34th Street, 100 West 33rd Street, and from the $375,000,000 drawn on our $750,000,000 delayed draw term loan, (ii) $10,208,000 of lower capitalized interest, and (iii) $7,823,000 of default interest on our Skyline properties mortgage loan, partially offset by (iv) $13,127,000 of interest savings from the re-financings of 888 7th Avenue and 770 Broadway and (v) $4,177,000 of interest savings from the repayment of the Bowen Building loan. 

Net Gain on Extinguishment of Skyline Properties Debt 

In the year ended December 31, 2016, upon the final disposition of the Skyline properties, all assets (approximately $236,535,000) and liabilities (approximately $724,412,000), were removed from our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a net gain of $487,877,000. 

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets 

The net gain of $175,735,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, consists primarily of a $159,511,000 net gain on sale of our 47% ownership interest in 7 West 34th Street and a $15,302,000 net gain on sale of our 20% ownership interest in Fairfax Square. The net gain of $251,821,000 in the prior year, consists of a $142,693,000 net gain on sale of 20 Broad Street, a $102,404,000 net gain on sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue and $6,724,000 from the sale of residential condominiums. 

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit  

In the year ended December 31, 2016, we had an income tax expense of $8,312,000, compared to a benefit of $84,695,000 in the prior year, an increase in expense of $93,007,000. This increase in expense resulted primarily from the prior year reversal of $90,030,000 of valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from the sale of 220 Central Park South residential condominium units to realize the deferred tax assets.  

Income from Discontinued Operations 

We have reclassified the revenues and expenses of our strip shopping center and mall business which was spun off to UE on January 15, 2015 and other related retail assets that were sold or are currently held for sale to “income from discontinued operations” and the related assets and liabilities to “assets related to discontinued operations” and “liabilities related to discontinued operations” for all the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The table below sets forth the combined results of assets related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries was $21,351,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $55,765,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $34,414,000. This decrease resulted primarily from lower net income allocated to the noncontrolling interests of our real estate fund investments. 

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership (Vornado Realty Trust) 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership was $53,654,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $43,231,000 in the prior year, an increase of $10,423,000. This increase resulted primarily from higher net income subject to allocation to unitholders. 

Preferred Share Dividends of Vornado Realty Trust 

Preferred share dividends were $75,903,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $80,578,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $4,675,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of the 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares on September 1, 2016.  

Preferred Unit Distributions of Vornado Realty L.P. 

Preferred unit distributions were $76,097,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $80,736,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $4,639,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of the 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred units on September 1, 2016. 

Preferred Share Issuance Costs 

In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $7,408,000 expense in connection with the write-off of issuance costs upon redeeming all of the outstanding 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares on September 1, 2016.

Same Store EBITDA 

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items. We also present same store EBITDA on a cash basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of acquired below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments). We present these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

This decrease was primarily due to (i) $26,652,000 of interest savings from the redemption of the $445,000,000 principal amount of the outstanding 7.875% senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of 2014, (ii) $21,375,000 of interest savings from the redemption of the $500,000,000 principal amount of the outstanding 4.25% senior unsecured notes on January 1, 2015, partially offset by (iii) $5,297,000 of interest expense from the issuance of $450,000,000 of 2.50% senior unsecured notes in June 2014, (iv) $5,182,000 of interest expense from the current year’s financings of 150 West 34th Street and the Center Building, and (v) $3,481,000 of lower capitalized interest. 

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets  

The net gain of $251,821,000 in year ended December 31, 2015, consists of a $142,693,000 net gain on sale of 20 Broad Street, a $102,404,000 net gain on sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue and $6,724,000 from the sale of residential condominiums. The net gain of $13,568,000 in the year ended December 31, 2014 is from the sale of residential condominiums and a land parcel.

Same Store EBITDA 

Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level expenses, as well as other non-operating items. We also present same store EBITDA on a cash basis (which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents, amortization of acquired below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other non-cash adjustments). We present these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  

Below is the reconciliation of EBITDA to same store EBITDA for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Related Party Transactions 

Alexander’s, Inc. 

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of Vornado’s Board of Trustees and its Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Urban Edge Properties 

We own 5.4% of UE. During 2015, we provided transition services to UE, primarily for information technology, human resources, tax and financial planning. In 2016, we continue to provide UE transition services for information technology and human resources. UE is providing us with leasing, development and property management services for certain of our retail properties including the retail assets of Alexander’s. Fees to UE for servicing the retail assets of Alexander’s are similar to the fees that we are receiving from Alexander’s as described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”) 

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other general partners. As of December 31, 2016, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.3% of Alexander’s common stock. 

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us.  We earned $521,000, $541,000, and $535,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loan and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity securities; and asset sales.  

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.  

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding preferred shares and debt securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

Dividends 

On January 18, 2017, Vornado declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.71 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.84 per common share). This dividend, if continued for all of 2017, would require Vornado to pay out approximately $537,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2017, Vornado expects to pay approximately $65,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $35,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations 

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” We have issued senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities. 

As of December 31, 2016, we had $1,501,027,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,364,523,000 of borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $115,630,000 and $19,847,000, respectively. A summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented below. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2017 and 2018, $118,585,000 and $209,208,000, respectively, of our outstanding debt matures; we may refinance this maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facilities. We may also refinance or prepay other outstanding debt depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2016.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations – continued 

Details of 2016 financing activities are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2015 financing activities are discussed below. 

Secured Debt  

On April 1, 2015, we completed a $308,000,000 refinancing of RiverHouse Apartments, a three building, 1,670 unit rental complex located in Arlington, VA. The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.28% and matures in 2025. We realized net proceeds of approximately $43,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.43%, $195,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in April 2015 and a $64,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.53% which was scheduled to mature in 2018.  

On June 2, 2015, we completed a $205,000,000 financing in connection with the acquisition of 150 West 34th Street. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and matures in 2018 with two one-year extension options.  

On July 28, 2015, we completed a $580,000,000 refinancing of 100 West 33rd Street, a 1.1 million square foot property comprised of 855,000 square feet of office space and the 256,000 square foot Manhattan Mall. The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.65% and matures in July 2020. We realized net proceeds of approximately $242,000,000. 

On September 22, 2015, we upsized the loan on our 220 Central Park South development by $350,000,000 to $950,000,000. The interest rate on the loan is LIBOR plus 2.00% and the final maturity date is 2020. In connection with the upsizing, the standby commitment for a $500,000,000 mezzanine loan for this development has been terminated by payment of a $15,000,000 contractual termination fee, which was capitalized as a component of “development costs and construction in progress” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.  

On December 11, 2015, we completed a $375,000,000 refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue, a 882,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.60% which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 3.15% and matures in December 2020. We realized net proceeds of approximately $49,000,000. 

On December 21, 2015, we completed a $450,000,000 financing of the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel and the adjacent retail town house located on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street. The loan matures in December 2020, with two one-year extension options. The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.80% for the first three years, LIBOR plus 1.90% for years four and five, and LIBOR plus 2.00% during the extension periods. We own a 74.3% controlling interest in the joint venture which owns the property. 

Senior Unsecured Notes 

On January 1, 2015, we redeemed all of the $500,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 4.25% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature on April 1, 2015, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through December 31, 2014.  

Unsecured Term Loan 

On October 30, 2015, we entered into an unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750,000,000. The facility matures in October 2018 with two one-year extension options. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.15% with a fee of 0.20% per annum on the unused portion. At closing, we drew $187,500,000. The facility provides that the maximum amount available is twice the amount outstanding on April 29, 2016, limited to $750,000,000, and all draws must be made by October 2017. This facility, together with the $950,000,000 development loan mentioned above, provides the funding for our 220 Central Park South development.

Acquisitions and Investments 

On January 20, 2015, we co-invested with the Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (“Fund”) and one of the Fund’s limited partners to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57.1% interest in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. The purchase price for the 57.1% interest was approximately $95,000,000 (our share $39,000,000) which valued the property at approximately $480,000,000. The property is encumbered by a $310,000,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.80% and maturing in December 2018 with a one-year extension option. Our aggregate ownership interest in the property increased to 33% from 11%. 

On March 18, 2015, we acquired the Center Building, a 437,000 square foot office building, located at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, New York, for $142,000,000, including the assumption of an existing $62,000,000, 4.43% mortgage maturing in October 2018. 

On June 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot retail property leased to Old Navy through May 2019, and 226,000 square feet of additional zoning air rights, for approximately $355,000,000. At closing we completed a $205,000,000 financing of the property.  

On June 24, 2015, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 55% interest, to develop a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building, located along the western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd Street. The development cost of this project is approximately $235,000,000. The development commenced during the fourth quarter of 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2018. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method. 

On July 31, 2015, we acquired 260 Eleventh Avenue, a 235,000 square foot office property leased to the City of New York through 2021 with two five-year renewal options, a 10,000 square foot parking lot and additional air rights. The transaction is structured as a 99-year ground lease with an option to purchase the land for $110,000,000. The $3,900,000 annual ground rent and the purchase option price escalate annually at the lesser of 1.5% or CPI. The buildings were purchased for 813,900 newly issued Operating Partnership units valued at approximately $80,000,000. 

On September 25, 2015, we acquired 265 West 34th Street, a 1,700 square foot retail property and 15,200 square feet of additional zoning air rights, for approximately $28,500,000.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures 

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet on our 220 Central Park South development site. The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion, of which $609,420,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016. 

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class-A office building at 512 West 22nd Street, along the western edge of the High Line in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% owned). The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $130,000,000, of which our share is $72,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $30,143,000 has been expended, of which our share is $16,579,000. 

We are developing a 170,000 square foot office and retail building at 61 Ninth Avenue, located on the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan. In February 2016, the venture purchased an adjacent five story loft building and air rights in exchange for a 10% common and preferred equity interest in the venture valued at $19,400,000, which reduced our ownership interest to 45.1% from 50.1%. On December 21, 2016, the venture obtained a $90,000,000 construction loan. The loan matures in December 2020 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 3.05%. As of December 31, 2016, there was nothing drawn on this loan. The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $150,000,000, of which our share is $68,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $38,499,000 has been expended, of which our share is $17,363,000. 

We are developing a 34,000 square foot office and retail building at 606 Broadway, located on the northeast corner of Broadway and Houston Street in Manhattan (50.0% owned). At closing, the joint venture obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% (3.66% at December 31, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year extension options. The venture’s incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $60,000,000, of which our share is $30,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, $20,833,000 has been expended, of which our share is $10,417,000. 

We are in the process of demolishing two adjacent Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street, and will replace them in the future with a new 335,000 square foot Class A office building, to be addressed 1700 M Street. The incremental development cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $170,000,000, of which $10,500,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2016. 

In September 2016, a joint venture between the Related Companies and Vornado was designated by New York State to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of office space and ancillary train hall retail. The joint venture will enter into a 99-year, triple-net lease and make a $230,000,000 contribution towards the construction of the train hall. Total costs for the redevelopment of the office and retail space are yet to be determined. 

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, including, in particular, the Penn Plaza District. 

There can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance 

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.  

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,622,000 ($1,976,000 for 2017) and 16% (17% for 2017) of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC. 

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.  

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $737,000,000. 

As of December 31, 2016, $19,847,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

As of December 31, 2016, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $173,000,000, which includes our share of the commitments of the Farley Post Office redevelopment joint venture. 

As of December 31, 2016, we have construction commitments aggregating $653,940,000.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) 

Vornado Realty Trust 

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $1,457,583,000, or $7.66 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,039,035,000, or $5.48 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $797,734,000, or $4.20 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $259,528,000, or $1.37 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Details of certain items that impact FFO are discussed in the financial results summary of our “Overview.”
