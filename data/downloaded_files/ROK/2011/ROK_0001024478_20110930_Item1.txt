Item 1.   Business    

General  

Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the Company or Rockwell Automation) is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses. The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985. Our products and services are designed to meet our customers needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce manufacturing business risk.  

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1996 in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RICs shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928.  

We divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses in 2007. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. The results of operations of these businesses are reported in income from discontinued operations in the Financial Statements for all periods presented.  

As used herein, the terms we, us, our, the Company or Rockwell Automation include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.  

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 7, 2012 (the 2012 Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), or in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (the Financial Statements), the information is incorporated in that Item by reference. All date references to years and quarters refer to our fiscal year and quarters unless otherwise stated.

Operating Segments  

We have two operating segments: Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions. In 2011, our total sales were $6.0 billion. Financial information with respect to our operating segments, including their contributions to sales and operating earnings for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2011, is contained under the caption Results of Operations in MD&A, and in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.  

Our Architecture & Software operating segment is headquartered in Mayfield Heights, Ohio and Singapore, and our Control Products & Solutions operating segment is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Both operating segments conduct business globally.

Geographic Information  

In 2011, sales to customers in the United States accounted for 49 percent of our total sales. Outside the United States, we sell in every region. The largest sales outside of the United States on a country-of-destination basis are in Canada, China, Italy, the United Kingdom and Brazil. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our operations outside of the United States. Sales and property information by major geographic area for each of the past three years is contained in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.  

Competition  

Depending on the product or service involved, our competitors range from large diversified corporations with business interests outside of industrial automation, to smaller companies that specialize in niche industrial automation products and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology leadership, knowledge of customer applications, installed base, distribution network, quality of products and services, global presence and price. Our major competitors of both segments include Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Honeywell International Inc., Schneider Electric SA and Emerson Electric Co.  

Distribution  

We sell our products, solutions and services through both independent distributors that typically do not carry products that compete with Allen-Bradley® products, and our direct sales force. In the United States, Canada and certain other countries, we sell primarily through the independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. In the remaining countries, we sell through a combination of our direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through independent distributors. Approximately 70% of our global sales are through independent distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately 10 percent of our total sales.  

Research and Development  

Our research and development spending for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $254.4 million, $198.9 million, and $170.0 million, respectively. Customer-sponsored research and development was not significant in 2011, 2010 or 2009.  

Employees  

At September 30, 2011 we had approximately 21,000 employees. Approximately 8,000 were employed in the United States.  

Raw Materials and Supplies  

We purchase a wide range of equipment, components, finished products and materials used in our business. The raw materials essential to the manufacture of our products generally are available at competitive prices. Although we have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors, we depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers.  

Backlog  

Our total order backlog at September 30 was (in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods due to the short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities. Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond 2012 were approximately $107.2 million as of September 30, 2011.

Environmental Protection Requirements  

Information about the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements and in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks  

We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and operations. Various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been made to us. We believe that none of these claims or requests will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. While in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property.  

The Companys name and its registered trademark Rockwell Automation® and other trademarks such as Allen-Bradley®, A-B® and PlantPAx Process Automation SystemTM are important to both of our business segments. In addition, we own other important trademarks that we use, such as ICS TriplexTM for our control products and systems for industrial automation, and Rockwell Software® and FactoryTalk® for our software offerings.  

Seasonality  

Our business segments are not subject to significant seasonality. However, the calendarization of our results can vary and may be affected by the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules.
