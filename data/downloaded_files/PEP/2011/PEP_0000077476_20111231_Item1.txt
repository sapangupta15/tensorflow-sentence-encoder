PART I  

 Item 1. Business.  

PepsiCo, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and was reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. When used in this report, the terms we, us, our, PepsiCo and the Company mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its divisions and subsidiaries.  

We are a leading global food and beverage company with hundreds of brands that are respected household names throughout the world. Either independently or through contract manufacturers or authorized bottlers, we make, market, sell and distribute a variety of convenient and enjoyable foods and beverages in more than 200 countries and territories.  

We continue to be guided by Performance with Purpose  our belief that what is good for business can and should be good for society. Our commitment to deliver sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet is as much of a financial decision as it is an ethical one. In 2011, PepsiCo earned a place on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the fifth consecutive year, the North America Index for the sixth consecutive year and was ranked as the number one company in the Food and Beverage Supersector.

Ingredients and Other Supplies  

The principal ingredients we use in our food and beverage businesses are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit and other fruits, oats, oranges, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils and wheat. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities for us due to their use in our facilities and in the trucks delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivatives. In addition, risk to our supplies of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.  

Our Brands  

We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aunt Jemima, Capn Crunch, Cheetos, Chesters, Chipsy, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Pepsi, Doritos, Duyvis, Emperador, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, Frustyle, Gamesa, Gatorade, G2, G Series, Grandmas, Imunele, Izze, Kurkure, Lays, Life, Little House in the Village, Lubimy Sad, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickies, Mothers, Mountain Dew, Mug, Munchies, Naked, Near East, Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Pepsi One, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Quakes, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Ruffles, Sabritas, Saladitas, Sakata, Sandora, 7UP and Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Santitas, Sierra Mist, Simba, Smartfood, Smiths, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SoBe Lifewater, Sonrics, Stacys, SunChips, Tonus, Tostitos, Trop 50, Tropicana, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Twister, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products, including Dole and Ocean Spray. Joint ventures in which we participate either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Starbucks and Sabra. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.

We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to some of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.  

Seasonality  

Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain food sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly beverage and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality does not have a material impact on our financial results.  

Our Customers  

Our primary customers include wholesale distributors, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, authorized independent bottlers and foodservice distributors, including hotels and restaurants. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality.  

In 2011, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), including Sams Club (Sams), represented approximately 11% of our total net revenue. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 30% of our 2011 North American net revenue, with Wal-Mart (including Sams) representing approximately 18%. These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  

See Our Customers contained in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customers, including our independent bottlers.  

See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our acquisitions of PBG and PAS in 2010.  

Our Competition  

Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. Our beverage, snack and food brands compete against global, regional, local and private label manufacturers and other value competitors.  

In U.S. measured channels, our chief beverage competitor, The Coca-Cola Company, has a larger share of carbonated soft drinks (CSD) consumption, while we have a larger share of liquid refreshment beverages consumption. In addition, The Coca-Cola Company has a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside the United States.

Our snack and food brands hold significant leadership positions in the snack and food industry worldwide.  

Our beverage, snack and food brands compete on the basis of price, quality, product variety and distribution. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging, pricing, increased efficiency in production techniques and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.  

 (1)  The categories and category share information in the charts above are as of December 25, 2011 and are defined by the following source of the information: Information Resources, Inc. The above charts exclude data from certain customers such as Wal-Mart that do not report data to this service.  

Research and Development  

We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth in these activities and to drive innovation globally. These activities principally involve the development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and modernization of production processes, and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Our Global Nutrition Group, led by our Chief Scientific Officer, oversees research and development efforts for the company, which are focused on identifying opportunities to transform and grow our product portfolio in the short- and long-term. Our research platforms are shared across specializations, countries and regions in order to generate innovation. In 2011, we continued to expand our

Table of Contents 

 portfolio of products made with nutritious ingredients, increasing the amount of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and low-fat dairy in certain of our products, and we continued to take steps to reduce the average amount of sodium, saturated fat and added sugar per serving in certain of our products. We also invested in agricultural development and the development and implementation of new technologies to both enhance the quality and value of our current and future product lines and to minimize our impact on the environment. We made investments to conserve energy and raw materials, and to reduce waste in our facilities, and to improve our packaging process to continue to reduce total packaging volume, recycle containers, use renewable resources and remove environmentally sensitive materials. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $525 million in 2011, $488 million in 2010 and $414 million in 2009 and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.  

Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance  

The conduct of our businesses, including the production, distribution, sale, advertising, marketing, labeling, safety, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are made, manufactured or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.  

In the United States, we are required to comply with a variety of laws and regulations, including: the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunity and our employment relationships, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws. For example, in California, Proposition 65 requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The State of California continues to evaluate various components and, consequently, food and beverage producers who sell products in California, including PepsiCo, may be required to provide warning labels on their products. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  

Outside the United States, we are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business.

Legislation has been introduced in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that would impose special taxes or other limitations on certain products we sell. For example, certain federal, state and local governments in the United States, and in certain other countries in which we operate, have either imposed or are considering the imposition of taxes on the sale of certain beverages, including non-diet and diet soft drinks, fruit drinks, teas and flavored waters. In the United States, federal and state legislators are also debating proposals to restrict the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to purchase beverages and foods whose nutritional content exceeds certain levels of sodium, saturated fat and sugar. In addition, legislation has been enacted in certain U.S. states and in certain other countries in which our products are sold that requires collection and recycling of containers or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain non-refillable containers unless a deposit or other fee is charged. It is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.  

The cost of compliance with U.S. and foreign laws does not have a material financial impact on our results of operations.  

We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, release and disposal of wastes at on-site and off-site locations. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental compliance requirements. We and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations of businesses acquired by our subsidiaries. While neither the results of these proceedings nor any indemnification obligations or other liabilities of our subsidiaries in connection therewith can be predicted with certainty, environmental compliance costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  

Employees  

As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 297,000 people worldwide, including approximately 107,000 people within the United States. Our employment levels are subject to seasonal variations. We or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
