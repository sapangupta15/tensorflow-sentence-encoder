Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  

 You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report to Stockholders.  

 Overview  

 Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, among other things, a company must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to its stockholders annually. Taxes are paid by stockholders on dividends received and any capital gains distributed. Most states also follow this federal treatment and do not require REITs to pay state income tax. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties. In this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  

 We own, develop, and manage retail real estate properties in five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers®, The Mills®, community/lifestyle centers, and international properties. As of December 31, 2008, we owned or held an interest in 324 income producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 164 regional malls, 70 community/lifestyle centers, 16 additional regional malls and four additional community centers acquired as a result of the 2007 acquisition of The Mills Corporation, or the Mills acquisition, 40 Premium Outlet Centers, 16 The Mills, and 14 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 41 states plus Puerto Rico. The Mills acquisition is described below in the "Results of Operations" section. We also own interests in four parcels of land held in the United States for future development. In the United States, we have one new property currently under development aggregating approximately 400,000 square feet which will open during 2009. Internationally, we have ownership interests in 52 European shopping centers (located in France, Italy, and Poland); seven Premium Outlet Centers located in Japan, one Premium Outlet Center located in Mexico, one Premium Outlet Center located in Korea, and one shopping center located in China. Also, through joint venture arrangements we have ownership interests in the following properties under development internationally: a 24% interest in two shopping centers in Italy, a 40% interest in a Premium Outlet Center in Japan, and a 32.5% interests in three additional shopping centers under construction in China.  

 We generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:    

Base minimum rents,   

Overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and   

Recoveries of substantially all of our recoverable expenditures, which consist of property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.   

 Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.  

 We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following:    

Focusing on leasing to increase revenues and utilization of economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,   

Expanding and re-tenanting existing franchise locations at competitive market rates,   

Adding mixed-use elements to properties,   

Selectively acquiring high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets, and   

Selling non-core assets.   

 We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:    

Establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including: payment systems (including handling fees relating to the sales of   

5 

Table of Contents   

bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,    

Offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the sale of energy,   

Selling or leasing land adjacent to our shopping center properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and   

 We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or renovate to enhance existing assets' profitability and market share when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in major metropolitan areas that exhibit strong population and economic growth.  

 We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to complement our portfolio. Lastly, we are selectively expanding our international presence. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.  

 To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:    

Provide the capital necessary to fund growth,   

Maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and   

Manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.   

 As more fully discussed in Notes 3 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements, we have retrospectively adopted SFAS 160 and concurrently applied certain provisions of EITF D-98. This resulted in the recording of certain reclassifications related to previously-reported minority interests and limited partner interests, which are now reported and referred to as noncontrolling interests within this discussion and the consolidated financial statements. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income available to common stockholders or earnings per share.  

 Results Overview  

 Diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.08 during 2008, or 4.1%, to $1.87 from $1.95 for 2007. The decrease is primarily due to the $20.3 million loss relating to the redemption of remarketable debt securities, and $21.2 million in impairment charges in 2008, as compared to net gains aggregating $1.7 million related to sales and disposition activity and impairment charges for the comparable period in 2007. Consolidated total revenues increased $132.4 million, or 3.6%, driven by the full year effect of our 2007 openings and expansion activities and the releasing of space at higher rental rates per square foot, or psf. Releasing spreads in the regional mall and Premium Outlet portfolios were strong at $8.02 psf (or 21.3%) and $12.48 psf (or 48.8%), respectively, due to continued demand for higher quality space in our portfolio. Total operating expenses increased $106.9 million, or 5.0%, due to additional depreciation provisions related to the full year of operations for 2007 openings and 2008 new openings, an increase in the provision for bad debts due to the estimated uncollectability of certain tenant receivables, and higher personnel and utility costs attributable to normal inflationary increases. Interest costs remained relatively flat despite an increase in total debt due to lowered variable borrowing costs as a result of a reduced one-month LIBOR rate, the benchmark rate for most of our floating rate debt.  

 In the United States, business fundamentals were relatively stable, except for tenant sales psf which were mixed across the portfolio, and were dependent upon asset type, geographic location, and mix of specialty and luxury tenants. Average base rents for the regional mall and domestic Premium Outlet portfolios were relatively stable for 2008. The regional malls average base rent ended the year at $39.49 psf, or an increase of 6.5% over 2007. The domestic Premium Outlets average base rent ended the year at $27.65 psf, or an increase of 7.7%. The stability of the occupancy, rent psf, and releasing rental spread fundamentals contributed to our ability to generate growth in our operating results despite the adverse effects the general economic pressures are creating for our tenants and the consumer.  

 Internationally, in 2008, we and our joint venture partners opened three additional centers (one each in Italy, China, and Japan) and expanded two existing Premium Outlet Centers which added an aggregate 1 million square feet of retail space to the international portfolio. Also during 2008, we acquired shares of stock of Liberty  

6 

Table of Contents 

International, PLC, or Liberty. Liberty operates regional shopping centers and is the owner of other prime retail assets throughout the U.K. Liberty is a U.K. FTSE 100 listed company, with shareholders' funds of £4.7 billion and property investments of £8.6 billion, of which its U.K. regional shopping centers comprise 75%. Assets of the group under control or joint control amount to £11.0 billion. Liberty converted into a U.K. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) on January 1, 2007. Our interest in Liberty is less than 5% of their shares and is adjusted to their quoted market price, including a related foreign exchange component.  

 Our effective overall borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased 55 basis points to 5.12% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This was a result of a significant decrease in the base LIBOR rate applicable to a majority of our floating rate debt (0.44% at December 31, 2008, versus 4.60% at December 31, 2007) and also the issuance of new unsecured and secured debt at favorable rates. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, included:    

decreasing borrowings on the Operating Partnership's $3.5 billion unsecured credit facility, or Credit Facility, to approximately $1.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008. The amount outstanding includes $446.3 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) in Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings.   

borrowing $735 million on a term loan that matures March 5, 2012 and bears a rate of LIBOR plus 70 basis points. This loan is secured by the cash flow distributed from six properties and has additional availability of $115 million through the maturity date.   

issuing two tranches of senior unsecured notes in May totaling $1.5 billion at a weighed average fixed interest rate of 5.74%. We used the proceeds of the offering to reduce borrowings on the Credit Facility and for general working capital purposes.   

redeeming the $200.0 million in remarketable debt securities that bore interest at 7.00%, and, as discussed above, resulted in our recognizing a $20.3 million loss in the second quarter related to this extinguishment of debt.   

redeeming a $150.0 million unsecured note that bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.38%.   

borrowing $190.0 million on a loan secured by Philadelphia Premium Outlets, which matures on July 30, 2014 and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 185 basis points. On January 2, 2009, we executed a swap agreement that fixes the interest rate of this loan at 4.19%. We used the proceeds of the borrowing for general working capital purposes.   

borrowing $260 million on a term loan that matures September 23, 2013 and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 195 basis points. On January 2, 2009, we executed a swap agreement that fixes the interest rate of this loan at 4.35%. This is a cross-collateralized loan that is secured by The Domain, Shops at Arbor Walk, and Palms Crossing. We used the proceeds of the borrowing for general working capital purposes.

 United States Portfolio Data  

 The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: occupancy; average base rent per square foot; and comparable sales per square foot for our four domestic platforms. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove properties sold in the year disposed. We are separately reporting in this section the 16 regional malls we acquired in the 2007 acquisition of The Mills Corporation, or the Mills acquisition. We do not include any properties located outside of the United States in this section. The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for:    

properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,   

properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and   

the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.

Table of Contents 

 Occupancy Levels and Average Base Rent Per Square Foot. Occupancy and average base rent are based on mall and freestanding Gross Leasable Area, or GLA, owned by us in the regional malls, and all tenants at The Mills, Premium Outlet Centers, and community/lifestyle centers. Our portfolio has maintained relatively stable occupancy and increased the aggregate average base rents despite the current economic climate.  

 Comparable Sales Per Square Foot. Comparable sales include total reported retail tenant sales at owned GLA (for mall and freestanding stores with less than 10,000 square feet) in the regional malls, and all reporting tenants at The Mills and the Premium Outlet Centers and community/lifestyle centers. Retail sales at owned GLA affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.  

 International Property Data  

 The following are selected key operating statistics for certain of our international properties.

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.   

We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in cash flows, occupancy and comparable sales per square foot at the property. We recognize an impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of   

9 

Table of Contents   

carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values.    

To maintain our status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a REIT. If we lost our REIT status, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded during those periods.   

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.   

A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 "Capitalization of Interest Cost" and SFAS No. 67 "Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties." The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening.

The properties are generally located in major metropolitan areas and consist of a combination of traditional anchor tenants, local and national retailers, and a number of larger "big box" tenants. We made an equity investment of $650.0 million and provided loans to SPG-FCM and Mills in various amounts throughout 2007 to acquire Mills' remaining common and preferred equity, and to pay various costs of the transaction. We serve as manager of the properties acquired in this transaction, which is more fully discussed in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section.

 For the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions. In the following discussions of our results of operations, "comparable" refers to properties open and operating throughout both the current and prior year.  

 In 2008 we had no consolidated property dispositions. During 2007, we disposed of five consolidated properties that had an aggregate book value of $91.6 million for aggregate sales proceeds of $56.4 million, resulting in a net loss on sale of $35.3 million. The loss on sale of these assets has been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. The operating results of the properties that we sold or disposed during 2007 were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. The following is a list of consolidated property dispositions and the date of disposition for which we have reported the operations or results of sale with discontinued operations:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

 We sold the following properties in 2006. Due to the limited significance of these properties' operations and result of disposition on our consolidated financial statements, we did not report these properties as discontinued operations.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2007  

 Minimum rents increased $137.2 million in 2008, of which the property transactions accounted for $64.6 million of the increase. Comparable rents increased $72.6 million, or 3.6%. This was primarily due to an increase in minimum rents of $82.1 million and an $8.5 million increase in straight-line rents, offset by a $16.4 million decrease in comparable property activity, primarily attributable to lower amounts of fair market value of in-place lease amortization.  

 Overage rents decreased $9.8 million or 8.9%, as a result of a reduction in tenant sales for the period as compared to the prior year.  

 Tenant reimbursements increased $42.8 million, due to a $26.9 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a $15.9 million, or 1.6%, increase in the comparable properties due to our ongoing initiative to convert leases to a fixed reimbursement methodology for common area maintenance costs.  

 Management fees and other revenues increased $18.7 million principally as a result of the full year of additional management fees derived from managing the properties acquired in the Mills acquisition, and additional leasing and development fees as a result of incremental joint venture property activity.  

 Total other income decreased $56.6 million, and was principally the result of the following:    

a $26.7 million decrease in interest income primarily due to the repayment of loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills, and lower interest rates attributable to this loan facility, combined with decreased interest earnings on investments due to lower excess cash balances and interest rates earned in 2008 as compared to 2007,   

an $18.7 million decrease in lease settlement income as a result of significant lease settlements received from two department stores in 2007, and   

a $14.3 million decrease in loan financing fees related to Mills-related loan activity during 2007 which did not recur in 2008.   

 These decreases were offset by a $3.1 million increase in net other activity.  

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $63.8 million in 2008 primarily due to our acquisition, expansion and renovation activity and the accelerated depreciation of tenant improvements for tenant leases terminated during the period and for properties scheduled for redevelopment.  

 Real estate taxes increased $21.3 million from the prior period, $9.0 million of which is related to the property transactions, and $12.3 million from our comparable properties due to the effect of increases resulting from reassessments, higher tax rates, and the effect of expansion and renovation activities.  

 Repairs and maintenance decreased $12.3 million due to our cost savings efforts.  

 Provision for credit losses increased $14.5 million primarily due to an increase in tenant bankruptcies and tenant delinquencies. This was reflected in total square footage lost to tenant bankruptcies of 1,104,000 during 2008 as compared to only 69,000 square feet in 2007. We anticipate a challenging environment for our tenants continuing into 2009.  

 Home and regional office expense increased $8.3 million primarily due to increased personnel costs, primarily the result of the Mills acquisition, and the increased expense from certain incentive compensation plans.  

 Other expenses increased $6.1 million due to increased consulting and professional fees, including legal fees and related costs.  

13 

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense increased $1.3 million despite an $823.9 million increase in consolidated borrowings to fund our development and redevelopment activities, and the full year impact of our borrowings to fund the Mills-related loans, due to a 55 basis point decline in our weighted average borrowing rates. This decrease in weighted average borrowing rates was driven primarily by a decline in the applicable LIBOR rate for a majority of our consolidated floating rate debt instruments, including the Credit Facility.  

 We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $20.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 related to the redemption of $200 million in remarketable debt securities. We extinguished the debt because the remarketing reset base rate was above the rate for 30-year U.S. Treasury securities at the date of redemption.  

 Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries increased $14.9 million due primarily to a $19.5 million tax benefit recognized in 2007 related to the impairment charge resulting from of the write-off of our investment in a land joint venture in Phoenix, Arizona.  

 Income from unconsolidated entities decreased $5.9 million, due primarily to the impact of the Mills acquisition (net of eliminations). On a net basis, our share of loss from SPG-FCM increased $4.7 million from the prior period due to a full year of SPG-FCM activity in 2008 as compared to only nine months of activity in 2007. The loss was driven by depreciation and amortization expense on asset basis step-ups in purchase accounting.  

 In 2008, we recognized an impairment of $21.2 million primarily representing the write-down of a mall property to its estimated net realizable value and the write-off of predevelopment costs for various development opportunities that we no longer plan to pursue. In 2007, we recognized an impairment of $55.1 million related to a land joint venture in Phoenix, Arizona.  

 The gain on sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities of $92.0 million in 2007 was primarily the result of Simon Ivanhoe selling its interest in certain assets located in Poland.  

 Preferred distributions of the Operating Partnership decreased $4.0 million as a result of the conversion or exchange of 1.5 million Series I preferred units to common units or Series I preferred shares.  

 In 2007, the loss on sale of discontinued operations of $35.3 million represents the net loss upon disposition of five non-core properties consisting of three regional malls and two community/lifestyle centers.  

 Preferred dividends decreased $14.0 million as a result of the conversion of 6.4 million Series I preferred shares into common shares and the redemption of the Series G preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2007.  

 Year Ended December 31, 2007 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2006  

 Minimum rents increased $133.9 million in 2007, of which the property transactions accounted for $87.0 million of the increase. Total amortization of the fair market value of in-place leases served to decrease minimum rents by $8.8 million due to certain in-place lease adjustments becoming fully amortized. Comparable rents increased $46.8 million, or 2.3%. This was primarily due to the leasing of space at higher rents that resulted in an increase in minimum rents of $54.6 million offset by a $9.2 million decrease in comparable property straight-line rents and fair market value of in-place lease amortization. In addition, rents from carts, kiosks, and other temporary tenants increased comparable rents by $1.4 million.  

 Overage rents increased $14.2 million or 14.9%, reflecting increases in tenant sales.  

 Tenant reimbursements increased $76.6 million, of which the property transactions accounted for $40.2 million. The remainder of the increase of $36.4 million, or 3.8%, was in comparable properties and was due to inflationary increases in property operating costs and our ongoing initiative of converting our leases to a fixed reimbursement methodology for common area maintenance costs.  

 Management fees and other income increased $31.5 million principally as a result of additional management fees derived from the additional properties being managed from the Mills acquisition and additional leasing and development fees as a result of incremental property activity.  

 Total other income increased $62.5 million, and was principally the result of the following:    

a $46.4 million increase in interest income, of which $39.1 million is as a result of Mills-related loans, combined with increased interest rates on the investment of excess cash balances,   

14 

Table of Contents     

an $18.4 million increase in lease settlement income as a result of settlements received from two department stores in 2007,   

a $17.4 million increase in loan financing fees, net of intercompany eliminations, related to Mills-related loan refinancing activity, offset by   

a $19.7 million decrease in gains on land sale activity.   

 Property operating expenses increased $13.3 million, or 3.0%, primarily as a result of the property transactions and inflationary increases.  

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $49.4 million and is primarily a result of the property transactions.  

 Real estate taxes increased $13.1 million from the prior period, $10.4 million of which is related to the property transactions, and $2.7 million from our comparable properties due to the effect of increases resulting from reassessments, higher tax rates, and the effect of expansion and renovation activities.  

 Repairs and maintenance increased $14.2 million due to increased snow removal costs in 2007 over that of 2006, normal inflationary increases, and the effect of the property transactions.  

 Advertising and promotion increased $5.9 million primarily due to the effect of the property transactions.  

 Home and Regional office expense increased $7.3 million primarily due to increased personnel costs, primarily the result of the Mills acquisition, and the effect of incentive compensation plans.  

 General and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million due to increased executive salaries, principally as a result of additional share-based payment amortization from the vesting of restricted stock grants.  

 Interest expense increased $124.0 million due principally to the following:    

increased borrowings to fund our development and redevelopment activities;   

additional borrowings to fund the Mills-related loans; and   

the full year effect of May, August, and December 2006 senior note offerings.   

 Also impacting interest expense was the consolidation of Town Center at Cobb, Gwinnett Place, and Mall of Georgia as a result of our acquisition of additional ownership interests, and the assumption of debt related to the acquisition of Las Americas Premium Outlets.  

 Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries decreased $22.7 million due primarily to a $19.5 million tax benefit recognized related to the impairment charge related to our write-off of our entire investment in Surprise Grand Vista JV I, LLC, which is developing land located in Phoenix, Arizona, along with a reduction in the taxable income for the management company as a result of structural changes made to our wholly-owned captive insurance entities.  

 Income from unconsolidated entities decreased $72.7 million, due in part to the impact of the Mills transaction (net of eliminations). On a consolidated net income basis, our share of income from SPG-FCM approximates a net loss of $58.7 million for the year due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses on asset basis step-ups in purchase accounting approximating $102.2 million for the second through fourth quarters of 2007. Also contributing to the decrease is the prior year recognition of $15.6 million in income related to a beneficial interest that we held in 2006 in a regional mall entity. This beneficial interest was terminated in November 2006.  

 In 2007, we recognized an impairment of $55.1 million related to our Surprise Grand Vista venture in Phoenix, Arizona. As described above, the charge to earnings resulted in a $19.5 million tax benefit, resulting in a net charge to earnings, before consideration of the limited partners' interest, of $35.6 million.  

 We recorded a $92.0 million net gain on the sales of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities in 2007 primarily as a result of the sale of five assets in Poland by Simon Ivanhoe. In 2006, we recorded a gain related to the sale of a beneficial interest of $86.5 million, a $34.4 million gain on the sale of a 10.5% interest in Simon Ivanhoe, and the net gain on the sale of four non-core properties, including one joint venture property, of $12.2 million.

 Preferred distributions of the Operating Partnership decreased $5.4 million due to the effect of the conversion of preferred units to common units or shares.  

 In 2007, the loss on sale of discontinued operations of $35.3 million represents the net loss upon disposition of five non-core properties consisting of three regional malls and two community/lifestyle centers.  

 Preferred dividends decreased $22.6 million as a result of the redemption of the Series G preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the Series F preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2006.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Because we generate revenues primarily from long-term leases, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. We manage our floating rate debt to be at or below 15-25% of total outstanding indebtedness by negotiating interest rates for each financing or refinancing based on current market conditions. Floating rate debt currently comprises approximately 15% of our total consolidated debt. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements as appropriate to assist in managing our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $1.9 billion during 2008. In addition, the Credit Facility provides an alternative source of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Also, we recently declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2009 that will be paid in cash and shares of common stock, with the cash component limited to 10% on an aggregate basis. Paying 90% of the 2009 dividend in shares of common stock allows us to satisfy our REIT taxable income distribution requirement while enhancing financial flexibility and balance sheet strength.  

 Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $271.6 million during 2008 to $773.5 million as of December 31, 2008. December 31, 2008 and 2007 balances include $29.8 million and $41.3 million, respectively, related to our co-branded gift card programs, which we do not consider available for general working capital purposes.  

 On December 31, 2008, we had available borrowing capacity of approximately $2.4 billion under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding borrowings of $1.0 billion and letters of credit of $15.7 million. During 2008, the maximum amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was $2.6 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was $1.4 billion. The weighted average interest rate was 3.49% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on January 11, 2010, which we can extend for another year at our option.  

 We and the Operating Partnership have historically had access to public equity and long term unsecured debt markets and access to private equity from institutional investors at the property level.  

 Our business model requires us to regularly access the debt and equity capital markets to raise funds for some of our acquisition activity, development and redevelopment capital, as well as to refinance many of our existing debt maturities. We are currently seeing significant turmoil in the capital markets. This has impacted access to debt and equity capital for many organizations, including ours. As demonstrated by recent financing activities (both secured and unsecured), we were able to successfully access capital in the third and fourth quarters of 2008; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so on similar terms or conditions in future periods. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facility to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2009.   

 Acquisition of The Mills Corporation by SPG-FCM   

 On February 16, 2007, SPG-FCM, a 50/50 joint venture between an affiliate of the Operating Partnership and funds managed by Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., or Farallon, entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Mills for $25.25 per common share in cash. The acquisition of Mills and its interests in the 36 properties that remain at December 31, 2008 was completed in April 2007. As of December 31, 2008, we and Farallon had each funded $650.0 million into SPG-FCM to acquire all of the common stock of Mills. As part of the transaction, the Operating Partnership also made loans to SPG-FCM and Mills primarily at rates of LIBOR plus 270-275 basis points. These funds were used by SPG-FCM and Mills to repay loans and other obligations of Mills, including the redemption of preferred stock, during 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our loan to SPG-FCM was $520.7 million, and the average outstanding balance during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2008 of all loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills was approximately $534.1 million. During 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $15.3 million and $39.1 million in interest income (net of inter-entity eliminations) related to these loans, respectively. We also recorded fee income, including fee income amortization related to up-front fees on loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills, during 2008 and 2007 of  

16 

Table of Contents 

approximately $3.1 million and $17.4 million (net of inter-entity eliminations), respectively, for providing refinancing services to Mills' properties and SPG-FCM. The existing loan facility to SPG-FCM bears a rate of LIBOR plus 275 basis points and matures on June 7, 2009, with three available one-year extensions. Fees charged on loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the loan.  

 The Mills acquisition involved the purchase of all Mills' outstanding shares of common stock and common units for approximately $1.7 billion (at $25.25 per share or unit), the assumption of $954.9 million of preferred stock, the assumption of a proportionate share of property-level mortgage debt, of which SPG-FCM's share approximated $3.8 billion, the assumption of $1.2 billion in unsecured loans provided by us, costs to effect the acquisition, and certain liabilities and contingencies, including an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8 billion. SPG-FCM has completed its purchase price allocations for the Mills acquisition using valuations developed with the assistance of a third-party professional appraisal firm.  

 In conjunction with the Mills acquisition, we acquired a majority interest in two properties in which we previously held a 50% ownership interest (Town Center at Cobb and Gwinnett Place) and as a result we have consolidated these two properties at the date of acquisition.  

 In addition to the loans provided to SPG-FCM, we also provide management services to substantially all of the properties in which SPG-FCM holds an interest.   

 Cash Flows   

 Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $1.9 billion during 2008. In addition, we received net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities in 2008 of $764.8 million. These activities are further discussed below in "Financing and Debt". We also:    

repurchased preferred stock and limited partner units amounting to $17.9 million, 

paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling $1.0 billion, 

 paid preferred stock dividends and preferred unit distributions totaling $58.7 million, 

funded consolidated capital expenditures of $874.3 million. These capital expenditures include development and other costs of $327.7 million, renovation and expansion costs of $431.9 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $114.7 million and 

funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $137.5 million.   

 In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and distributions to stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building renovations and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:    

excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves, 

borrowings on our Credit Facility, 

additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or 

additional equity raised in the public or private markets.   

 We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2009, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from retail tenants, many of whom are experiencing considerable financial distress. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the Credit Facility, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.   

 Financing and Debt  

 Unsecured Debt   

 Our unsecured debt currently consists of $10.7 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership and the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 37.5 basis points and an additional facility fee of 12.5 basis points. The Credit Facility matures January 11, 2010 and may be extended one year at our option.

Table of Contents 

 On May 19, 2008, we issued two tranches of senior unsecured notes totaling $1.5 billion at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.74% consisting of a $700.0 million tranche with a fixed interest rate of 5.30% due May 30, 2013 and a second $800.0 million tranche with a fixed interest rate of 6.125% due May 30, 2018. We used proceeds from the offering to reduce borrowings on the Credit Facility and for general working capital purposes.  

 On June 16, 2008, the Operating Partnership completed the redemption of the $200.0 million outstanding principal amount of its 7% Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities, or MOPPRS. The redemption was accounted for as an extinguishment and resulted in a charge in the second quarter of 2008 of approximately $20.3 million.  

 On August 28, 2008, the Operating Partnership repaid a $150.0 million unsecured note, which had a fixed rate of 5.38%.  

 During the year ended December 31, 2008, we drew amounts from the Credit Facility to fund the redemption of the remarketable debt securities and the repayment of the $150.0 million unsecured note. Other amounts drawn on the Credit Facility during the period were primarily for general working capital purposes. We repaid a total of $2.7 billion on the Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2008. The total outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008 was $1.0 billion, and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was approximately $2.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average outstanding balance was approximately $1.4 billion. The amount outstanding as of December 31, 2008 includes $446.3 million in Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings. In addition, subsequent to December 31, 2008, we repaid $600 million in unsecured notes, consisting of two $300 million tranches that bore rates of 3.75% and 7.13%, respectively, using proceeds from the Credit Facility.   

 Secured Debt   

 Total secured indebtedness was $6.3 billion and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2008, we repaid $274.0 million in mortgage loans, unencumbering five properties.  

 On January 15, 2008, we entered into a swap transaction that effectively converted $300.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at a rate of 3.21%.  

 On March 6, 2008, we borrowed $705 million on a term loan that matures March 5, 2012 and bears a rate of LIBOR plus 70 basis points. On May 27, 2008, the loan was increased to $735 million. This loan is secured by the cash flow distributed from six properties and has additional availability of $115 million through the maturity date.  

 On July 30, 2008, we borrowed $190.0 million on a loan secured by Philadelphia Premium Outlets, which matures on July 30, 2014 and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 185 basis points. On January 2, 2009, we executed a swap agreement that fixes the interest rate on this loan at 4.19%.  

 On September 23, 2008, we borrowed $170.0 million on a term loan that matures September 23, 2013 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 195 basis points. On November 4, 2008, the loan was increased to $220 million and on December 17, 2008, the loan was increased to its maximum availability of $260 million. This is a cross-collateralized loan that is secured by The Domain, Shops at Arbor Walk, and Palms Crossing. On January 2, 2009, we executed a swap agreement that fixes the interest rate on $200.0 million of this loan at 4.35%.   

 Summary of Financing   

 Our consolidated debt, adjusted to reflect one fair value derivative outstanding at December 31, 2007 and the effect of fixing variable rate debt with interest rate swaps, and the effective weighted average interest rates for the years then ended consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2008, we had interest rate cap protection agreements on $281.8 million of consolidated variable rate debt. We also hold $505.0 million of notional amount variable rate swap agreements that have a weighted average fixed pay rate of 3.29% and a weighted average variable receive rate of 2.75%. As of December 31, 2008, the net effect of these agreements effectively converted $505.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.  

 Contractual Obligations and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements: The following table summarizes the material aspects of our future obligations as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Represents principal maturities only and therefore, excludes net premiums and discounts of $17,199 and all required interest payments. We incurred interest expense during 2008 of $947.1 million, net of capitalized interest of $27.8 million. 

(2)Represents our pro rata share of principal maturities and excludes net premiums and discounts. 

(3)Represents our pro rata share of capital expenditure commitments. 

(4)Represents only the minimum non-cancellable lease period, excluding applicable lease extension and renewal options.  

 Capital expenditure commitments presented in the table above represent new developments, redevelopments or renovation/expansions that we have committed to the completion of construction. The timing of these expenditures may vary due to delays in construction or acceleration of the opening date of a particular project. In addition, the amount includes our share of committed costs for joint venture developments.  

 Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in real estate joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 7 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements. Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture, is typically secured by the joint venture property, and is non-recourse to us. As of December 31, 2008, the Operating Partnership had loan guarantees and other guarantee obligations to support $71.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively, to support our total $6.6 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness presented in the table above.   

 Preferred Stock Activity   

 During 2008, we issued a total of 22,400 shares of Series I 6% Preferred Stock for an equal number of Series I preferred units and we issued 5,151,776 shares of common stock to holders of Series I preferred stock who exercised their conversion rights.

 Acquisitions and Dispositions   

 Buy-sell provisions are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. Our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions at any time. If we determine it is in our stockholders' best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.  

 Acquisitions. The acquisition of high quality individual properties or portfolios of properties remains an integral component of our growth strategy. Effective January 1, 2008 we acquired an additional 1.8% interest in Oxford Valley Mall and Lincoln Plaza (which gives us a combined ownership interest in each of 64.99%). On September 12, 2008 we acquired an additional 3.2% interest in White Oaks Mall (which gives us an ownership interest of 80.68%). On December 31, 2008 we acquired an additional 5% interest in Gateway Shopping Center for $2.6 million (which gives us 100% interest in the asset).  

 Dispositions. We continue to pursue the sale of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not the primary retail venue within their trade area. On December 30, 2008, the joint venture partnership in which we own a 50% interest sold Cincinnati Mills for $8.3 million. No material gain or loss was recorded on this disposition. There were no other dispositions of properties during the year ended December 31, 2008.   

 Development Activity   

 New Domestic Developments. Given the significant downturn in the economy, we have substantially reduced our development spending. We expect to complete construction on Cincinnati Premium Outlets, a 400,000 square foot upscale manufacturers' outlet center located in Monroe, OH, during the third quarter of 2009. The estimated total cost of this project is $92 million, and the carrying amount of the construction in progress as of December 31, 2008 was $43 million. We expect to fund this project with available cash flow from operations and borrowings from the Credit Facility.  

 Strategic Domestic Expansions and Renovations. In addition to new development, we also incur costs to renovate and/or expand selected properties. Current projects include a 600,000 square foot Phase II expansion at The Domain, a 220,000 square foot expansion of Camarillo Premium Outlets  The Promenade at, and the addition of Nordstrom and small shops at South Shore Plaza. We expect to fund these capital projects with available cash flow from operations and borrowings from the Credit Facility. We expect to invest a total of approximately $300 million (our share) on expansion and renovation activities in 2009.   

 Capital Expenditures on Consolidated Properties.   

 The following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Table of Contents  

 International Development Activity. We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international investments to fund future international development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded our European investments with Euro-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against local currency fluctuations. This has also been the case with our Premium Outlet Centers in Japan and Mexico where we use Yen and Peso denominated financing, respectively. We expect our share of international development costs for 2009 will be approximately $140 million. We expect international development and redevelopment/expansion activity for 2009 to include:    

continuing construction by Gallerie Commerciali Italia, or GCI, on two shopping centers: one in Naples, and one in Sicily with a total gross leasable area, or GLA, of 942,000 square feet. 

completing and opening of Ami Premium Outlets Phase 1, a 227,000 square foot Premium Outlet Center located in Japan. We hold a 40% ownership interest in this property. 

completing and opening three additional Wal-Mart anchored shopping centers, all located in China. We hold a 32.5% ownership interest in these centers.   

 Currently, our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso and other foreign currencies is not material. In addition, since cash flows from international operations are currently being reinvested in other development projects, we do not expect to repatriate foreign denominated earnings in the near term.  

 The carrying amount of our total combined investment in Simon Ivanhoe and GCI, as of December 31, 2008, including all related components of other comprehensive income, was $224.2 million. Our investments in Simon Ivanhoe and GCI are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Currently two European developments are under construction which will add approximately 942,000 square feet of GLA for a total net cost of approximately €221 million, of which our share is approximately €53 million, or $74.8 million based on current Euro:USD exchange rates.  

 On October 20, 2005, Ivanhoe Cambridge, Inc., or Ivanhoe, an affiliate of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, effectively acquired our former partner's 39.5% ownership interest in Simon Ivanhoe. On February 13, 2006, we sold a 10.5% interest in this joint venture to Ivanhoe for €45.2 million, or $53.9 million and recorded a gain on the disposition of $34.4 million. This gain is reported in "gain on sales of interests in unconsolidated entities" in the 2006 consolidated statements of operations. We then settled all remaining share purchase commitments from the company's founders, including the early settlement of some commitments by purchasing an additional 25.8% interest for €55.1 million, or $65.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we and Ivanhoe each own a 50% interest in Simon Ivanhoe at December 31, 2007 and 2008.  

 As of December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of our 40% joint venture investment in the seven Japanese Premium Outlet Centers including all related components of other comprehensive income was $312.6 million. Currently, Ami Premium Outlets, a 227,000 square foot Premium Outlet Center, is under construction in Ami, Japan. The project's total projected net cost is JPY 15.5 billion, of which our share is approximately JPY 6.2 billion, or $68.5 million based on applicable Yen:USD exchange rates.  

 As of December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of our 32.5% joint venture investment in GMI including all related components of other comprehensive income was $53.9 million. Currently, one center is open in Changshu, China and three additional centers are under development. The three centers under development will add approximately 1.5 million square feet of GLA for a total net cost of approximately CNY 1.6 billion, of which our share is approximately CNY 523 million, or $76.8 million based on applicable CNY:USD exchange rates.  

 During 2008, we acquired shares of stock of Liberty International, PLC, or Liberty. Liberty operates regional shopping centers and is the owner of other prime retail assets throughout the U.K. Liberty is a U.K. FTSE 100 listed company, with shareholders' funds of £4.7 billion and property investments of £8.6 billion, of which its U.K. regional shopping centers comprise 75%. Assets of the group under control or joint control amount to £11.0 billion. Liberty converted into a U.K. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) on January 1, 2007. Our interest in Liberty is less than 5% of their shares and is adjusted to their quoted market price, including a related foreign exchange component.  

 Distributions and Stock Repurchase Program  

 On January 30, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.90 per share, to be paid in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. While our stockholders will have the right to elect to receive their dividend in either cash or common stock, we have announced that the aggregate cash component of the  

21 

Table of Contents 

dividend will not exceed 10% of the total dividend, or $0.09 per share. If the number of stockholders electing to receive cash would result in our payment of cash in excess of this 10% limitation, we will allocate the cash payment on a pro rata basis among those stockholders making the cash election. We have reserved the right to elect to pay this dividend all in cash. Our Board of Directors reviews and approves dividends on a quarterly basis, and no determination has been made about whether our remaining 2009 dividends will be paid in a similar combination of cash and common stock. Paying all or a portion of the 2009 dividend in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock allows us to satisfy our REIT taxable income distribution requirement under existing IRS revenue procedures, while enhancing our financial flexibility and balance sheet strength.  

 Dividends during 2008 aggregated $3.60 per share and dividends during 2007 aggregated $3.36 per share all paid in cash. We must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our consolidated net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a "non-cash" expense. Future dividends and distributions of Simon Property and the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, and what may be required to maintain our status as a REIT.  

 Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common stock through July 2009. We may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2008, no purchases were made as part of this program. The program had remaining availability of approximately $950.7 million at December 31, 2008.  

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the impact of a prolonged recession, our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may update that discussion in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure  Funds from Operations  

 Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on funds from operations, or FFO. We consider FFO to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use this measure internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.  

 We determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP:    

excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, 

excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes, 

excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, 

plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest, and 

all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.   

 We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that our computation of FFO might not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs and that FFO:    

does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, 

should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and 

is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.   

 The following schedule sets forth total FFO before allocation to the limited partners of the Operating Partnership and FFO allocable to us. This schedule also reconciles FFO to consolidated net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods presented.

 Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:    

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets;   

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and   

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

 We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  

 Based on that assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.  

 Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page 27 of this Annual Report.
