Introduction

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including "Item 1 – Business;" "Item 6 – Selected Financial Data;" and "Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

We begin our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products. This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then discuss our Results of Operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. We then 

34
provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Contractual Obligations" and "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements."

Recent Developments

On March 1, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Microsemi for $68.78 per share in cash. The acquisition price represents a total equity value of approximately $8.35 billion, and a total enterprise value of about $10.15 billion, after accounting for Microsemi’s cash and investments, net of debt, on its balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Microsemi offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and system solutions for aerospace and defense, communications, data center and industrial markets. Microsemi recorded net sales of $492.2 million for its second fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2018 compared to $442.9 million for its second fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2017 and net sales of $960.9 million for the six months ended April 1, 2018 compared to $878.4 million for the six months ended April 2, 2017. Microsemi is headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, and has approximately 4,800 employees globally. 

The Board of Directors of each of Microchip and Microsemi have unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and approval by Microsemi stockholders. There is no financing condition to the closing of the Merger. Assuming the timely receipt of the aforementioned regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of the other closing conditions, we anticipate that the merger will be completed in late May/early June 2018. 

We plan to finance the acquisition of Microsemi with a combination of cash and cash equivalents, new borrowings on our line of credit, and the issuance of new debt. For further details, see the discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 

Strategy

Our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications. Our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions, including general purpose and specialized microcontrollers, development tools and related software, analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products, wired and wireless connectivity products, memory products and technology licensing. We provide highly cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed signal integration and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products. We license our SuperFlash technology and other technologies to wafer foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products, gate array, radio frequency (RF) and analog products that require embedded non-volatile memory.

We sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries. The principal markets that we serve include consumer, automotive, industrial, office communication, computing and aerospace. Our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets. 

Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe and assembly and test. The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry. By owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields. Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles. This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin. We do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties. 

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products. We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs. While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products. This allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly. Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently. 

35
We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. Our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, Flash-IP systems, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries. We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products. 

We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. Our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. We currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in North America, Europe and Asia. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. Many of our client engagement managers (CEMs), embedded system engineers (ESEs), and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment. We believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for CEMs and distributor sales teams. ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world, and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.

See "Our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry," on page 17 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, share-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. We review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); however, we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below.

Revenue Recognition – Distributors

Our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights which prevent the sales pricing from being fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to our distributors. Therefore, revenue recognition is deferred until the pricing uncertainty is resolved, which generally occurs when the distributor sells the product to their customer. At the time of shipment to these distributors, we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment, relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor, and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets. 

In connection with our acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel, we acquired certain distributor relationships where revenue was recognized upon shipment to the distributors based on certain contractual terms or prevailing business practices that resulted in the price being fixed and determinable at such time. Following an acquisition, we undertake efforts to align the contract terms and business practices of the acquired entity with our own. Once these efforts are complete, revenue recognition is changed. With respect to such distributor relationships acquired in the Atmel acquisition, as of October 1, 2016, these business practices were conformed to those of our other distributors resulting in the deferral of revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers. With respect to such distributor relationships acquired in the Micrel acquisition, in the December 2015 quarter, 

36
these distributor contracts were changed to be consistent with those of our other distributors which resulted in the deferral of revenue recognition under such contracts until the distributor sells the product to their customers.

Deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor; however, the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions. 

We sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price. However, distributors resell our products to end customers at a broad range of individually negotiated price points. The majority of our distributors' resales require a reduction from the original list price paid. Often, under these circumstances, we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors' outstanding accounts receivable balance. The credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer. The price reductions vary significantly based on the customer, product, quantity ordered, geographic location and other factors. Discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare. The effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers. Thus, a portion of the "deferred income on shipments to distributors" balance represents the amount of distributors' original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributors in the future. We do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions; rather, price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred, which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product. At March 31, 2018, we had approximately $479.6 million of deferred revenue and $145.8 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as $333.8 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. At March 31, 2017, we had approximately $418.0 million of deferred revenue and $125.2 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as $292.8 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers. These additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business.

Distributor advances, reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $203.9 million at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. On sales to distributors, our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost. The sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant. It is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases, requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances, on a current basis, generally within 30 days, for amounts originally invoiced. This practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors. As such, we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors' working capital requirements. These advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage. Such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income. We process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors' balance and true-up the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter. The terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured, bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand. The agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time.

We reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other factors. Price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered. When we reduce the price of our products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction. There is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection, as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors' balance.

Products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations. We routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account. Because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped, and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost, we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value.

Recent Updates to Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delayed the effective date of the new standard by one year to December 15, 2017, for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after that date. In accordance with the delay, the new standard was effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2018. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which addresses implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and discussed by the Revenue Recognition Transition Resource Group. For a discussion of the financial statement impact related to the adoption of these standards, see “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations

All of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, (i) acquisition-related costs, except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities, will be expensed in the period incurred; (ii) non-controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; (iii) in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility; (iv) restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and (v) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital. The measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment. The valuation of intangible assets, in particular, requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: revenue, expenses, capital spending and other costs, and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. On an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment and through March 31, 2018, we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance. 

Share-based Compensation

We measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and employee stock purchase rights, to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values. For the past several years, we have utilized RSUs as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees. Share-based compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. Total share-based compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2018 was $93.2 million, of which $79.4 million was reflected in operating expenses and $13.8 million was reflected in cost of sales. Total share-based compensation included in our inventory balance was $8.1 million at March 31, 2018. 

During the year ended March 31, 2017, we elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). Under this standard, entities are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on share-based payment awards, as previously required, or to recognize forfeitures as they occur. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we estimated the number of share-based awards to be forfeited due to employee turnover.

38
If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense. Future share-based compensation expense and unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable. In estimating our inventory obsolescence, we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12-month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month demand. Estimates for projected 12-month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior three-month period, which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business. The estimated 12-month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12-month demand estimate. Management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations. For example, demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand. Alternatively, demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued. 

In periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity, the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales. As a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities, approximately $1.9 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2016. We operated at slightly below normal capacity levels in our Thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in approximately $1.0 million in charges to cost of sales. There was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in each of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. We provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets, including state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits, where it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of such assets, will not be realized. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), we released our valuation allowance on foreign tax credits during the period ending March 31, 2018, which was provisional. We are still evaluating how the Act impacts our valuation allowance on state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits, and we may report an adjustment to the valuation allowances under Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118 in subsequent quarters. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 

Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. During the year ended March 31, 2018, various foreign jurisdictions finalized their audits. The close of these audits did not have an adverse impact on our financial statements. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 

The accounting model as defined in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions. The recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the 

39
taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue. We will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period. All adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement. Generally, adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period or if the statute of limitation expires. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model, amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model.

On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law. The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the Act began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal 2019.

The corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018. Since we have a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, we are subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates. As a result, our fiscal 2018 federal statutory rate will be a blended rate of 31.5%.

In addition to the impacts of tax reform on fiscal 2018, the Act also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) a new provision designed to tax low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ("FTCs") and a deduction of up to 50% to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (2) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (3) limitations on the deductibility of interest expense; and (4) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability. While each of these provisions is expected to have an impact on our tax expense for fiscal 2019 and future periods, we expect the tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant, adverse impact.

Due to the complexity of the new tax on low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the Act and the application of ASC 740. Based on recent FASB deliberations, it appears we will be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes. Our selection of an accounting policy will depend, in part, on analyzing our facts to determine what the impact is expected to be under each method.

Senior and Junior Subordinated Convertible Debt

We separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. This results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Lastly, we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met. We apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash. This method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future.

Contingencies

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims and other matters. Additionally, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant. Consequently, we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions. We also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs. With respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims, although the outcomes are generally not determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Litigation and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and we are, from time to time, subject to such litigation and disputes. As a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation or disputes in the future.

40
We accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. Contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable, which generally is based on a probability weighted model. If fair value is not determinable, contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable.

Results of Continuing Operations

The following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Sales

We operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies. We sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers, referred to as OEMs, in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral. In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit.

The following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increases in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were impacted by the following two accounting factors, which occurred in fiscal 2017:

•an amount of revenue that could not be recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America relating to Atmel's inventory in the distribution channel on the acquisition date; and

•the impact of the change in timing of revenue recognition for some of Atmel's distributors from shipment to the distributor to upon sale by the distributor to their customers. 

Excluding the impact of the two accounting factors described above, net sales for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 increased 14.0%. This increase was primarily due to growth in our business driven by favorable economic and semiconductor industry conditions. Approximately 6% of the increase in net sales during this period was due to increases in the overall average selling price of products sold as a result of favorable market conditions and product and geographic mix. The remaining sales growth was primarily due to a net increase in the volume of products sold. We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any product, customer or market that accounted for a material portion of the increase. The overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual 

41
products; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period.

Excluding the impact of the two accounting factors described above, net sales for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 increased 60.7%. This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Atmel and also due to growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. Average selling prices were not a material factor in the sales growth as they were flat in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Sales growth was primarily driven by the increase in the number of units of our semiconductor products sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 as a result of our acquisition of Atmel and growth in our historical business.

As discussed in the following paragraphs, there were revenue gains across our product lines with the largest dollar value increase in microcontrollers, which is our largest product line. This growth was due to favorable economic and semiconductor conditions and market share gains. Key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include:

•our acquisition of Atmel, which closed on April 4, 2016;

•our acquisition of Micrel, which closed on August 3, 2015;

•global economic conditions in the markets we serve;

•semiconductor industry conditions;

•our new product offerings that have increased our served available market;

•customers' increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions;

•inventory holding patterns of our customers;

•increasing semiconductor content in our customers' products; and

•continued market share gains in the segments of the markets we address.

Net sales by product line for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Microcontrollers

Our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales. Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 65.9%, 63.0% and 61.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 22.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and increased approximately 59.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from our acquisition of Atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions.

Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. The overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results. The average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period.

42
Analog, Interface, Mixed Signal and Timing Products

Sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 23.9%, 26.1% and 27.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Net sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products increased approximately 7.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased approximately 49.3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by our acquisition of Atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. Additionally, some new analog products, which are integrated with a microcontroller core, are classified as microcontrollers, rather than analog. This classification adversely impacted some of the increases in net sales of analog products during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

Analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or non-proprietary in nature. Currently, we consider a majority of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products. We may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results. We anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products will increase over time. 

Memory Products

Sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 5.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and approximately 5.4% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Net sales of our memory products increased approximately 8.5% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and increased approximately 57.5% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. The increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by our acquisition of Atmel.

Memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature, with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability, driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products. We may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Technology Licensing

Technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies and fees for engineering services. Technology licensing accounted for approximately 2.6%, 2.7% and 4.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Net sales related to our technology licensing increased approximately 14.9% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased approximately 2.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees as well as general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. 

Multi-market and Other

 Multi-market and Other (MMO) consists of manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, complex programmable logic devices, and products for aerospace applications. Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 2.6%, 2.8% and 1.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Net sales related to these services and products increased approximately $8.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased approximately $70.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in MMO net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and 

43
semiconductor industry conditions. The increase in MMO net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by our acquisition of Atmel. MMO net sales can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).

Distribution

Distributors accounted for approximately 54% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, approximately 55% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and approximately 53% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. No single distributor accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel. 

Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.

At March 31, 2018, our distributors maintained 36 days of inventory of our products compared to 33 days at March 31, 2017 and 32 days at March 31, 2016. Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) on April 1, 2018, we did not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors materially impacted our net sales due to the fact that we recognized revenue based on when the distributor sells the product to their customer. Upon our adoption of Topic 606 commencing on April 1, 2018, we will be required to recognize revenue from distributors at the time our products are sold to the distributor. As a result, beginning April 1, 2018, inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales.

Sales by Geography

Sales by geography for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Americas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 85% of our total net sales in fiscal 2018 and 84% of our total net sales in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016. Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Sales to customers in Asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to Asia and growth in demand from the emerging Asian market. Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia.

Sales to customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 30%, 32% and 30% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales to customers in Taiwan accounted for approximately 11%, 9% and 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Gross Profit

Our gross profit was $2,420.7 million in fiscal 2018, $1,757.2 million in fiscal 2017 and $1,205.5 million in fiscal 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 60.8% in fiscal 2018, 51.6% in fiscal 2017 and 55.5% in fiscal 2016.

44
The most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this Form 10-K were:

•charges of approximately $186.7 million in fiscal 2017 and approximately $44.9 million in fiscal 2016 related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisitions which increased the value of our acquired inventory and subsequently increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was recognized;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•for fiscal 2018, inventory write-downs being lower than the gross margin impact of sales of inventory that was previously written down; and

•fluctuations in the product mix of microcontrollers, analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products, memory products and technology licensing.

Other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this Form 10-K include:

•continual cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing, such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques;

•lower depreciation as a percentage of cost of sales;

•increases in the level of assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities compared to assembly and test operations performed by our third-party contractors, which lower our manufacturing costs as these functions are performed internally; and

•favorable market conditions and product mix.

We adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industry-related conditions. When production levels are below normal capacity, we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity. In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated at normal capacity levels, which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position at the time. As a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities, approximately $1.9 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2016. We operated at slightly below normal capacity levels in our Thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in approximately $1.0 million in charges to cost of sales. 

The process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins. Our wafer fabrication facility located in Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly utilizes our 0.5 micron to 1.0 micron processes. Our wafer fabrication facility located in Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4) predominantly utilizes our 0.13 micron to 0.5 micron processes. We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs. All of our production in Fab 2 and Fab 4 has been on 8-inch wafers during the periods covered by this report. We consider normal capacity at Fab 2 and Fab 4 to be 90% to 95%. Our wafer fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado (Fab 5) currently utilizes processes between 0.25 micron and 1.0 micron that run on 6-inch wafers. We consider normal capacity at Fab 5 to be 70% to 75%. As a result of our acquisition of Micrel in August 2015, we acquired a 6-inch wafer fabrication facility in San Jose, California and have since transitioned products previously manufactured at this facility to our Fab 2, Fab 4 and Fab 5 facilities. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we decommissioned this San Jose facility and, in June 2017, we completed the sale of these assets for proceeds of $10.0 million. 

Our overall inventory levels were $476.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $417.2 million at March 31, 2017 and $306.8 million at March 31, 2016. We maintained 112 days of inventory on our balance sheet at March 31, 2018 compared to 103 days of inventory at March 31, 2017 and 110 days at March 31, 2016. We expect our days of inventory levels in the June 2018 quarter to be down six days to up four days compared to the March 2018 levels. We believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers.

We anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products, memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve.

We operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand and Philippines and, as a result of our acquisition of Atmel, we acquired a test facility in Calamba, Philippines. During fiscal 2018, approximately 42% of our assembly requirements were performed in our Thailand facilities, compared to approximately 36% during fiscal 2017 and approximately 53% during fiscal 2016. The 

45
percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. Third-party contractors located primarily in Asia perform the balance of our assembly operations. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, approximately 64% and 60%, respectively, of our test requirements were performed in our Thailand and Philippines facilities compared to approximately 81% of our test requirements performed in our Thailand facilities during fiscal 2016. The increase in the percentage of assembly and test work that was performed internally in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 is primarily due to our recent investments in assembly and test equipment, which have increased our internal capacity capabilities. The primary reason for the percentage reduction in the assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is our acquisition of Atmel, which outsourced most of these activities. We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process.

We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. During fiscal 2018, approximately 42% of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 41% during fiscal 2017 and approximately 39% during fiscal 2016.

Our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract. While we review the quality, delivery and cost performance of our third-party contractors, our future operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels.

Research and Development (R&D)

R&D expenses for fiscal 2018 were $529.3 million, or 13.3% of sales, compared to $545.3 million, or 16.0% of sales, for fiscal 2017 and $372.6 million, or 17.1% of sales, for fiscal 2016. We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives. R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.

R&D expenses decreased $16.0 million, or 2.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our Atmel acquisition and lower share-based compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated Atmel employees during fiscal 2017. Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses as our revenue increases. R&D expenses increased $172.7 million, or 46.3%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to additional compensation and other costs from our acquisition of Atmel. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to our restructuring activities and synergies realized following the acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel. 

R&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 were $452.1 million, or 11.4% of sales, compared to $499.8 million, or 14.7% of sales, for fiscal 2017, and $301.7 million, or 13.9% of sales, for fiscal 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $47.7 million, or 9.5%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our Atmel acquisition and lower share-based compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated Atmel employees during fiscal 2017. Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses as our revenue increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $198.1 million, or 65.7%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to additional costs from our acquisition of Atmel. 

46
Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets

Amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2018 was $485.5 million compared to $337.7 million in fiscal 2017 and $174.9 million in fiscal 2016. The primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was amortization of in-process R&D assets from our acquisition of Atmel, which assets started to amortize during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The primary reasons for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were increased amortization from our acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel partially offset by decreased amortization from our customer-related intangible assets from our acquisitions of Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) and ISSC Technologies Corporation (ISSC). 

Special Charges and Other, Net 

During fiscal 2018, we incurred special charges and other, net of $17.5 million comprised primarily of a $19.5 million charge for fees associated with transitioning from a public utility provider in Oregon to a lower cost direct access provider. During fiscal 2017, we incurred special charges and other, net of $98.6 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges. Our restructuring activities include workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations. In connection with these activities we incurred employee separation costs, contract exit costs, other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses. The impairment losses were recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition of Atmel that affected the use and life of these assets. During fiscal 2016, we incurred special charges and other, net of $4.0 million comprised of $11.2 million of restructuring charges associated with our acquisition activity and legal settlement costs of approximately $4.3 million partially offset by special income and other, net of $11.5 million related to an insurance settlement for reimbursement of funds we previously paid to settle a lawsuit in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. 

Other Income (Expense)

Interest income in fiscal 2018 was $22.0 million compared to $3.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $24.4 million in fiscal 2016. The primary reason for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to higher cash and investment balances. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 relates to lower invested cash balances as we used cash to finance a significant portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Atmel. 

Interest expense in fiscal 2018 was $199.0 million compared to $146.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $104.0 million in fiscal 2016. The primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to our issuance of $2,645.0 million of convertible notes in February 2017 partially offset by lower interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility. In February 2017, we paid off the remaining balance on our credit facility. The primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 relates to higher interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition of Atmel, as well as the aforementioned issuance of convertible notes in February 2017.

Loss on settlement of convertible debt in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was $16.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively. In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we settled $143.8 million and $431.3 million, respectively, in principal of our 2007 Junior Subordinated Convertible Debt (2007 Junior Debt). Total conversions for fiscal 2018 were for a principal amount of $32.5 million for which we settled the principal amount in cash and issued 0.5 million shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversions occurring prior to the call notice and $41.0 million in cash for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversion requests received after the call notice. In June 2017, we exchanged in privately negotiated transactions $111.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 2007 Junior Debt for (i) $111.3 million principal amount of our 2017 Junior Subordinated Convertible Debt (2017 Junior Debt) with a market value of $119.3 million plus (ii) the issuance of 3.2 million shares of our common stock with a value of $254.6 million. In the case of the fiscal 2017 settlement, the principal value of $431.3 million was settled in cash and we issued shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount plus a cash inducement fee of $5.0 million. 

Other loss, net in fiscal 2018 was $5.8 million compared to other income, net of $1.3 million in fiscal 2017 and other income, net of $8.9 million in fiscal 2016. The primary reasons for the change in other income (loss) during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to impairments on available for sale investments partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impairments on the available for sale investments are due to the anticipated liquidation of these investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to fund our pending acquisition of Microsemi. The primary reason for the change 

47
in other income (loss) during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 relate to the lower realized gains on the sale of marketable equity and debt securities. 

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on U.S. earnings. We had an effective tax rate of 65.4% in fiscal 2018, a 90.0% benefit in fiscal 2017, and a 15.2% benefit in fiscal 2016. Excluding certain tax events described below, our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the U.S. primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes $644.7 million of tax expense estimated on a provisional basis, calculated under SAB 118, related to the one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings, $136.7 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted U.S. statutory tax rate of 21.0%, and $20.5 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the release of valuation allowances against our foreign tax credit carryforwards. These three adjustments increased (reduced) our effective tax rate by 87.4%, (18.5%), and (2.8%), respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $17.0 million tax benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 2.3%. Our effective tax rate in 2018 also includes a $27.2 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.7%. Our effective tax rate in 2018 also includes a $11.3 million benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.5%. 

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included $36.3 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and $7.9 million of expense related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization, which reduced our effective tax rate by 40.4% and increased our effective tax rate by 8.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a $12.8 million benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 14.3%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a $25.0 million benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 27.8%. 

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 included $12.1 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and $15.5 million of benefits related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization, which reduced our effective rate by 4.3% and 5.5%, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 also included a $2.5 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the R&D credit and a $13.5 million benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 0.9% and 4.8%, respectively. 

We are also subject to taxation in many other jurisdictions where we have operations. The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate. Our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was approximately 33% and our domestic statutory tax rate for fiscal 2017 was approximately 37%. Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were much lower than this amount. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, historical loss carry-forwards, financing arrangements and other factors. Our effective tax rate has been, and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses. 

Our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in Thailand, Cayman and Ireland. Our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand. Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future, however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays or we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20%. We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. The remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. are earnings accrued in Ireland at a 12.5% statutory tax rate and earnings accrued by Microchip’s offshore technology company which was resident in the Cayman Islands at a 0% statutory tax rate. The tax rate differential in Ireland, Thailand, and Cayman plus the tax holiday in Thailand make up approximately 100% of the $208.8 million benefit of foreign income taxed at a lower rate than the federal rate for fiscal 2018.

Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2005 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, 

48
no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 

Results of Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations represent the mobile touch operations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of Atmel. On November 10, 2016, we completed the sale of the mobile touch assets to Solomon Systech (Limited) International, a Hong Kong based semiconductor company. The transaction included the sale of certain semiconductor products, equipment, customer list, backlog, patents, and a license to certain other intellectual property and patents related to Atmel's mobile touch product line. We also agreed to provide certain transition services to Solomon Systech. For financial statement purposes, the results of operations for this discontinued business have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $6.0 million, consisting of a pre-tax loss from operations of $8.2 million and a pre-tax gain on sale of $0.6 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We had $2,196.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at March 31, 2018, an increase of $786.3 million from the March 31, 2017 balance of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long term investments. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations of $1,419.6 million, offset by dividend payments of $337.5 million, $206.8 million in capital payments and $73.4 million on the settlement of a portion of our convertible debt.

Net cash provided from operating activities was $1,419.6 million for fiscal 2018, $1,059.5 million for fiscal 2017 and $744.4 million for fiscal 2016. The increase in net cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher net sales as well as operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring efforts related to our acquisition of Atmel. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to operating cash flows resulting from our acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel and operating synergies from our process efficiency and restructuring efforts. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,011.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2,838.0 million for fiscal 2017 and net cash provided by investing activities of $800.4 million in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2018 net investing cash flows primarily result from the net increase in investments of $808.1 million due to cash from operations as well as capital purchases. Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 investing cash flows include net cash and cash equivalents used to finance acquisitions of $2,747.5 million and $361.9 million, respectively. Excluding cash flows used in acquisitions, net investing activities resulted in a use of $90.5 million in fiscal 2017 and net cash provided of $1,162.3 million in fiscal 2016, and represented primarily the net change in our investments, capital purchases and sale of assets. 

Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. Capital expenditures were $206.8 million in fiscal 2018, $75.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $97.9 million in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity, the addition of research and development equipment and new office buildings. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 were relatively less than we have experienced in recent years as we delayed certain purchases until we had finalized and developed plans following our acquisition of Atmel regarding technology platforms and other manufacturing activities. We currently intend to spend approximately $225.0 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities. We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $415.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared to net cash provided from financing activities of $595.5 million for fiscal 2017 and net cash used in financing activities of $59.9 million for fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2018 financing cash outflows were primarily the result of dividend payments and payments on the settlement of our convertible debt. Fiscal 2017 cash flows were favorably impacted by the net proceeds of debt issued that year. Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include:

•In fiscal 2017, we issued $2,645.0 million of debt, of which $2,118.7 million was used to settle debt and reduce borrowings on our credit facility. 

•In fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $363.8 million, which was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On May 18, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.8 billion, with a $250.0 million foreign currency sublimit, a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $25.0 million swingline loan sublimit. The revolving loan facility consists of approximately $244.3 million of revolving loan commitments (the “2020 Revolving Loans”) that terminate on February 4, 2020 (the “2020 Maturity Date”) and approximately $3.6 billion of revolving loan commitments (the “2023 Revolving Loans” and, together with the 2020 Revolving Loans, the “Revolving Loans”) that terminate on May 18, 2023 (the “2023 Maturity Date”). The Revolving Loans bear interest, at our option, at (a) in the case of 2020 Revolving Loans, the base rate plus a spread of 0.25% to 1.25% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25% to 2.25%, and (b) in the case of 2023 Revolving Loans, the base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 2.00%, in each case, with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. 

In June 2017, in connection with the settlement of $111.3 million of our convertible debt, we amended our credit agreement to (i) extend the time period during which we are permitted to repurchase, redeem or exchange our 2007 junior debt and (ii) amend the maximum total leverage ratio covenant to extend the time period for permitted refinancings or exchanges of the 2007 junior debt that may be excluded from the calculation of the ratio, subject to certain conditions.

In February 2017, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, increase certain covenant compliance ratios. The February 2017 amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property. Proceeds of loans made under our credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. See Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement.

The enactment of the recent U.S tax reform Act in December 2017 imposes a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Due to this change, the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time, no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity. Future distributions of non-U.S. assets to the U.S. will no longer be subject to U.S. federal taxation. As a result of the Act, we recognized a one-time transition tax expense of $644.7 million on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings. This value is identified as provisional in our consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018, and is subject to future measurement period adjustments in accordance with SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118. We intend to elect to pay this tax over a period of eight years, with 8% of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025, and fiscal 2026. 

In February 2016, we terminated our ten-year fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements which were related to a portion of our fixed-rate 1.625% 2015 senior subordinated convertible debt. The interest rate swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges. We paid variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR minus 53.6 basis points and we received a fixed interest rate of 1.625%. Upon termination, the contracts were in an asset position, resulting in cash receipts of approximately $25.7 million, which included $3.7 million of accrued interest. The cash flows from the termination of these interest rate swap agreements have been reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

We enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years, there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future. At March 31, 2018, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.

On April 4, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Atmel. Under the terms of the merger agreement executed on January 19, 2016, Atmel stockholders received $8.15 per share consisting of $7.00 per share in cash and $1.15 per share in shares of Microchip common stock. We financed the purchase price of our Atmel acquisition using approximately $2.04 billion of cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, approximately $0.94 billion from additional borrowings under our credit agreement and approximately $486.1 million through the issuance of an aggregate of 10.1 million shares of our common stock. The acquisition price represented a total equity value of approximately $3.47 billion, and a total enterprise value of approximately $3.44 billion, after excluding Atmel's cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet of approximately $39.3 million. The acquisition was structured in a manner that enabled us to utilize a substantial portion of the cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner. Although we 

50
believe our determinations with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition are reasonable, we are regularly audited by the IRS and may be audited by other taxing authorities, and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such audit. 

On August 3, 2015, we acquired Micrel for $14.00 per share and paid an aggregate of approximately $430.0 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 8.6 million shares of our common stock to Micrel shareholders. We financed the cash portion of the purchase price with amounts borrowed under our credit agreement.

On March 1, 2018, in connection with our execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a Commitment Letter with JPMorgan, pursuant to which JPMorgan committed to provide to us, among other things, (1) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.0 billion and (2) a 364-day secured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $625.0 million, in each case, subject to the execution of definitive documentation and customary closing conditions. JPMorgan’s commitments in respect of the Term Loan Facility will be reduced in the event we raise certain other debt or equity financing.

We estimate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the acquisition of Microsemi and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be approximately $10.15 billion to:

•make payments to Microsemi’s stockholders of the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement; 

•make payments in respect of Microsemi’s outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement; 

•refinance or otherwise discharge outstanding indebtedness of Microsemi that is required to be refinanced or discharged pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the termination of commitments and the refinancing of indebtedness under Microsemi’s existing credit agreement, and the optional redemption of Microsemi’s 9.125% Senior Notes due 2023; and 

•pay related fees, expenses and taxes in connection with the foregoing and consummation of the Merger. 

We expect to finance the foregoing through a combination of:

•the incurrence of loans under our new term loan facility or other debt financing; 

•revolving loans under our amended and restated credit agreement; and 

•Microchip’s and Microsemi’s cash and cash equivalents on hand at closing. 

As of March 31 2018, Microchip and Microsemi had combined cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $2,419.8 million.

In May 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 15.0 million shares of common stock from the approximately 11.4 million shares remaining under the current authorization. As of March 31, 2016, we had repurchased 8.6 million shares under this authorization for approximately $363.8 million. There were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. There is no expiration date associated with this repurchase program. 

As of March 31, 2018, we held approximately 18.2 million shares as treasury shares. 

On October 28, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share was paid on December 6, 2003 in the amount of $4.1 million. To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $3.5 billion. Cash dividends paid per share were $1.449, $1.441 and $1.433 during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Total dividend payments amounted to $337.5 million, $315.4 million, $291.1 million during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. On May 8, 2018, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3635 per share, which will be paid on June 4, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 21, 2018 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately $85.6 million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws.

As discussed above, we plan to finance our pending acquisition of Microsemi through a combination of incurrence of loans under a new term loan facility, revolving loans under Microchip's amended and restated credit agreement, the issuance of the 

51
senior secured debt; and Microchip's and Microsemi's cash and cash equivalents on hand at closing. Other than such financing required to fund our Microsemi acquisition, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the semiconductor industry is capital intensive. In order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development. We may increase our borrowings under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, (including the impact of the Act), demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Operating lease obligations include $23.3 million of future lease payments which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. This obligation is due under an operating lease from the acquisition of Atmel for a building in San Jose, California.

(2) Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property, plant and equipment. These obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2018, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.

(3) Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries of approximately $101.6 million for delivery of wafers in fiscal 2019.

(4) For purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 senior convertible debt will be paid on February 15, 2027, which is the maturity date of such debt.

(5) For purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt will be paid on February 15, 2025, which is the maturity date of such debt.

(6) For purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 junior convertible debt will be paid on February 15, 2037, which is the maturity date of such debt.

(7) For purposes of this table pension obligations due in more than 5 years represent the expected pension payments from 2023 through 2027. It excludes pension obligations subsequent to 2027.

(8) During fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisionary one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $644.7 million, as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform of which we expect to result in future cash payments of approximately $336.1 million. This one-time transition tax is identified as provisional in our consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018, and is subject to future measurement period adjustments in accordance with SAB 118. We intend to elect to pay this tax over a period of eight years, with 8% of the transition tax paid each 

52
year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid during fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026.

(9) Total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities, or certain purchase obligations as discussed below. The contractual obligations also do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services, with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries, are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.

The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)

As of March 31, 2018, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. In the ordinary course of business, we may provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements. Based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements.
