Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt. 

Our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following, after giving effect to our 2016 Refinancings:

•the potential refinancing of our $12.1 billion in existing debt, compared to $11.9 billion in the prior year;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•potential future borrowings of incremental debt.

Potential Refinancing of Existing Debt

Over the next 12 months we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt. We have no debt maturities that have anticipated repayment dates during 2016. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had no interest rate swaps hedging any refinancings. See below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of December 31, 2015, after giving effect to our 2016 Refinancings, and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates. 

Floating Rate Debt

We manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2015, after giving effect to our 2016 Refinancings, we had $2.4 billion of floating rate debt, none of which had LIBOR floors. As a result, a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 1/8 of a percent point over a 12-month period would increase our interest expense by approximately $2.9 million after giving effect to our 2016 Refinancings. As of December 31, 2014, we had $4.2 billion of floating rate debt, which included $2.8 billion of debt with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% per annum.

Potential Future Borrowings of Incremental Debt

We typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance. See "Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources" regarding our liquidity strategy.

The following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates. The future principal payments and weighted-average interest rates are presented as of December 31, 2015 after giving effect to our 2016 Refinancings. These debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates, and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain notes (see footnotes (c) and (d)). See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.

(a)The fair value of our debt is based on indicative quotes (that is, non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask offers. These fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amount, which could be realized in a current market exchange.

(b)The average interest rate represents the weighted-average stated coupon rate (see footnote (c) and (d)).

(c) The impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates is not considered. The January 2010 tower revenue notes consist of two series of notes with principal amounts of $350.0 million and $1.3 billion, having anticipated repayment dates in 2017 and 2020, respectively. The August 2010 tower revenue notes consist of two series of notes with principal amounts of $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, having anticipated repayment dates in 2017 and 2020, respectively. See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our issuance of $1.0 billion of the May 2015 tower revenue notes with anticipated repayment dates ranging between 2022 and 2025. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's 2016 refinancing activities, including the issuance of the 2016 Senior Unsecured Notes.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)Predominantly consists of $2.0 billion 2016 Term Loan A maturing in 2021. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.

(f)Predominately consists of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.381% secured notes due 2017.
