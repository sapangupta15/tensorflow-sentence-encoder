The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders. In 1973, these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company completed its initial public stock offering (the “IPO”) in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined under the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries which made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”), which permit the Company to engage in certain business activities which the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on its income, and the Company includes a provision for taxes in its consolidated financial statements. In 1994, the Company reorganized as a Maryland corporation. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company's common stock, Class I Depositary Shares, Class J Depositary Shares, Class K Depositary Shares, Class L Depositary Shares and Class M Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbols “KIM”, “KIMprI”, “KIMprJ”, “KIMprK”, “KIMprL”, and “KIMprM”, respectively. 

The Company’s initial growth resulted primarily from real estate under development and the construction of shopping centers. Subsequently, the Company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation and internationally within Canada, Mexico and South America (Chile, Brazil and Peru). The Company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests. The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics.  

During 2013, the Company began its efforts to exit its foreign investments due to perceived changes in market conditions. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has substantially liquidated its investments in Mexico and Canada and has completely exited South America.  

In addition, the Company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and, from time to time, provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets, however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s consolidated revenues were $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, which includes $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $8.6 million, respectively, from the Company’s consolidated foreign investments. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and preferred equity investments were $60.8 million, $218.7 million and $480.4 million, respectively, which includes equity loss of $1.6 million, equity income of $149.0 million and equity income of $408.4 million, respectively, from the Company’s unconsolidated foreign investments. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further details regarding the Company’s foreign investments. 

Business Objective and Strategies 

Business Objective 

The Company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air shopping centers in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by: 

●   

increasing value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth;    

●   

increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders;    

●   

continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers; and    

●   

increasing capital appreciation.    

Operating Strategies 

The Company’s operating strategies are to (i) own and operate its shopping center properties at their highest potential through maximizing and maintaining rental income and occupancy levels, (ii) attract local area customers to its shopping centers, which offer day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items, and (iii) maintain a strong balance sheet.  

To effectively execute these strategies the Company seeks to:  

●   

increase rental rates through the leasing of space to new tenants;    

●   

attract a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers at its properties, which include grocery store, national or regional discount department store or drugstore tenants;    

●   

renew leases with existing tenants;     

●   

decrease vacancy levels and duration of vacancy;    

●   

monitor operating costs and overhead;     

●   

redevelop existing shopping centers to obtain the highest and best use to maximize the real estate value;    

●   

provide unmatched tenant services deriving from decades of experience managing retail properties; and    

●   

provide communities with a destination for everyday living goods and services.

The Company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base. As of December 31, 2017, no single open-air shopping center accounted for more than 1.8% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest, or more than 1.6% of the Company’s total shopping center GLA. Furthermore, at December 31, 2017, the Company’s single largest tenant represented only 3.6% and the Company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 12.0% of the Company’s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.  

As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of open-air shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts. Management is associated with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry organizations. Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the Company’s properties. 

Investment Strategies 

The Company’s investment strategy is to invest capital into high quality assets which are concentrated in major metro markets that provide opportunity for growth while disposing of lesser quality assets in more undesirable locations. Through this strategy, the Company has steadily progressed in its transformation of its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio. The properties acquired are primarily located in major metro areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume. The Company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels, rental rates and rental growth.  

The Company’s investment strategy also includes the retail re-tenanting, renovation and expansion of its existing centers and acquired centers. The Company may selectively acquire established income-producing real estate properties and properties requiring significant re-tenanting and redevelopment, primarily in geographic regions in which the Company presently operates. Additionally, the Company may selectively acquire land parcels in its key markets for real estate development projects for long-term investment. The Company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise. The Company also continues to simplify its business by reducing the number of joint venture investments and pursuing redevelopment opportunities to increase overall value within its portfolio. 

As part of the Company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use, which may include residential and mixed-use components. In addition, the Company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as, repositioning underperforming retail locations, retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support. The Company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain properties. If the Company accepts sales prices for any of these assets that are less than their net carrying values, the Company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material.  

In order to execute the Company’s strategy, the Company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time, providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively, primarily focusing on U.S. open-air shopping centers.  

The Company may either purchase or lease income-producing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships, joint ventures or similar types of co-ownership. Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and/or other indebtedness. Financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments. Any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the Company’s equity interest in such property.  

Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 

The Company is focused on building a thriving and sustainable business, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for its stakeholders. The Company takes pride in how it conducts business, including the positive contribution it makes to communities and its initiatives to safeguard the environment.  

By investing in technologies and improved processes, the Company has delivered significant year-over-year reductions in energy consumption across its portfolio of properties. Re-thinking how it controls and lights its parking areas significantly reduces operating costs and meaningfully curbs negative environmental impacts associated with fossil-fuel based energy sources. 

The Company’s responsibility efforts are not limited to promoting operational efficiency. The Company believes that sustainability leadership also requires an understanding of how environmental, social, and governance issues impact both its customers and the organization’s future growth prospects. As a result, it is taking steps to engage with its tenants on these issues and to better understand how the shopping centers it chooses to own and manage can grow in value by viewing them through this unique lens.
