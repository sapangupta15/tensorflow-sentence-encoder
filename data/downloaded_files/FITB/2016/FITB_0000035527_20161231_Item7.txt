MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorps financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  

The Bancorps revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 57% and 43% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.  

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of losses on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral due to a weakened economy within the Bancorps footprint.  

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, corporate banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, securities gains, net and other noninterest income. 

 Noninterest expense includes personnel costs, net occupancy expense, technology and communication costs, card and processing expense, equipment expense and other noninterest expense.  

Vantiv, Inc. and Vantiv Holding, LLC Transactions  

On July 27, 2016, the Bancorp entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. under which a portion of its TRA with Vantiv, Inc. was terminated and settled in full for consideration of a cash payment in the amount of $116 million from Vantiv, Inc. Under the agreement, the Bancorp terminated and settled certain TRA cash flows it expected to receive in the years 2019 to 2035, totaling an estimated $331 million. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $116 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income from this settlement in 2016.  

Additionally, the agreement provides that Vantiv, Inc. may be obligated to pay up to a total of approximately $171 million to the Bancorp to terminate and settle certain remaining TRA cash flows, totaling an estimated $394 million, upon the exercise of certain call options by Vantiv, Inc. or certain put options by the Bancorp. If the associated call options or put options are exercised, 10% of the obligations would be settled with respect to each quarter in 2017 and 15% of the obligations would be settled with respect to each quarter in 2018. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $164 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2016 associated with these options. This agreement did not impact the TRA payments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is not expected to impact the TRA payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bancorp exercised its right to purchase approximately 7.8 million Class C Units underlying the warrant at the $15.98 strike price. This exercise was settled on a net basis for approximately 5.7 million Class C Units, which were then exchanged for approximately 5.7 million shares of Vantiv, Inc. Class A Common Stock of which 4.8 million shares were sold in a secondary offering and 0.9 million shares were repurchased by Vantiv, Inc. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2016 on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC.  

Branch Consolidations and Sales Activity  

The Bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience in its consumer distribution network. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining full-service branches at certain of its existing banking center locations. Similarly, the Bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion. On June 16, 2015, the Bancorps Board of Directors authorized management to pursue a plan to further develop its distribution strategy, including a plan to consolidate and/or sell certain operating branch locations and to sell certain parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired by the Bancorp for future branch expansion (the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan). In addition, the Bancorp announced on September 13, 2016 that it had identified an additional 44 branch locations and 5 parcels of undeveloped land that it planned to consolidate or sell.  

On January 29, 2016, the Bancorp closed the previously announced sale in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank and recorded a gain on the sale of $8 million in other noninterest income.

 Additionally, on April 22, 2016, the Bancorp closed the previously announced sale in the Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank of Pennsylvania and recorded a gain on the sale of $11 million in other noninterest income. Both transactions were part of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan.  

As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp had 64 branch locations and 35 parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired for future branch expansion that it intended to consolidate or sell. These branch locations and parcels of undeveloped land, which include unsold properties from the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan as well as properties included in the September 13, 2016 announcement, represent $39 million, $16 million and $1 million of land and improvements, buildings and equipment, respectively, included in bank premises and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016, of which $29 million, $9 million and $1 million, respectively, were classified as held for sale. The Bancorp expects to receive approximately $72 million in annual savings from operating expenses upon completion of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan and the consolidation and/or sale of properties included in the September 13, 2016 announcement. Approximately $60 million of the $72 million in total estimated annual savings are attributable to branches that were closed prior to December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

On September 29, 2016, the Bancorp closed on the sale of an office complex. The sale also included all of the Bancorps rights, title and interest as a landlord under existing leases in the complex. Under the terms of the transaction, the Bancorp received proceeds of approximately $31 million and entered into a lease agreement whereby the Bancorp leased-back approximately 25% of the office complex. In conjunction with the transaction, which qualified as a sale-leaseback under U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp retired assets with a net book value of approximately $10 million, recognized a deferred gain of $10 million, which is being amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the 15 year lease term, and recorded a gain on the transaction of $11 million in other noninterest income.  

NorthStar Strategy  

In the third quarter of 2016, the Bancorp launched the NorthStar Strategy, a three-year plan designed to achieve the Bancorps 

 vision to be the One Bank people most value and trust and deliver strong, consistent returns through longer term economic cycles.  

The strategy is designed to impact every line of business, every employee and, most importantly, every customer. The Bancorp is focused on:  

   ●    

Building a differentiated brand and corporate reputation by improving the customer experience, increasing brand equity and delivering on the Bancorps $30 billion community commitment.  

   ●    

Delivering a better, more differentiated value proposition by investing in our sales and service channels and expanding on our products, solutions and expertise.  

   ●    

Generating returns on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) of 12% to 14%, a return on average assets of 1.1% to 1.3% and an efficiency ratio below 60% by the end of 2019.  

   ●    

Achieving risk and operational excellence.  

The Bancorp has implemented several initiatives to assist in achieving these goals, including the following: our partnership with GreenSky, upgrades to our mortgage and teller systems, expansion of credit card and treasury management products, focused growth in asset-based lending and our commercial verticals and acceleration of our automation and robotics initiatives.  

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions  

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorps common stock during the term of the repurchase agreements. For more information on the accelerated share repurchase program, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of the Bancorps accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into or settled during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, refer to Table 2. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Open Market Share Repurchase Transactions  

Between June 17, 2016 and June 20, 2016, the Bancorp repurchased 1,436,100 shares, or approximately $26 million, of its outstanding common stock through open market repurchase transactions.  

Senior and Subordinated Notes Offerings  

On March 15, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured bank notes. The bank notes consisted of $750 million of 2.30% senior fixed-rate notes due on March 15, 2019; and $750 million of 3.85% subordinated fixed-rate notes due on March 15, 2026. These bank notes will be 

 redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.  

On June 14, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.3 billion of 2.25% unsecured senior fixed-rate notes due on June 14, 2021. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.  

On September 27, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior bank notes due on September 27, 2019.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The bank notes consisted of $750 million of 1.625% senior fixed-rate notes and $250 million of senior floating-rate notes at three-month LIBOR plus 59 bps. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed-rate notes to a floating-rate, which resulted in an effective interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 53 bps. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments  

The FRB conducted a regularly scheduled examination covering 2011 through 2013 to determine the Banks compliance with the CRA. This CRA examination resulted in a rating of Needs to Improve. The Bank believes that the Needs to Improve rating reflects legacy issues that have been remediated during the intervening three years. While the Banks CRA rating is Needs to Improve the Bancorp and the Bank face limitations and conditions on certain activities, including the commencement of new activities and merger with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the FRB began a CRA examination of the Bank. For further information, refer to the Regulation and Supervision subsection of Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Earnings Summary  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $2.01 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. Pre-provision net revenue was $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  

 Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average taxable securities of $3.1 billion and average loans and leases of $981 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps to 50 bps in 2015 and 25 bps to 75 bps in 2016. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in average long-term debt of $750 million coupled with a decrease in the net interest rate spread to 2.66% during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.69% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.88% for the both years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

 Noninterest income decreased $307 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue partially offset by an increase in corporate banking revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $291 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $64 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition to valuation adjustments, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC compared with a gain of $9 million on the sale of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in income from the TRAs associated with Vantiv, Inc. of $233 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year and a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment of $88 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in the prior year. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $63 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by an increase in origination fees and gains on loan sales. Corporate banking revenue increased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by increases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Noninterest expense increased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in personnel costs, technology and communications expense and other noninterest expense partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and card and processing expense. Personnel costs increased $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in base compensation, variable compensation, and higher retirement and severance costs related to the Bancorps voluntary early retirement program. Technology and communications expense increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance and other growth initiatives. Other noninterest expense increased $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, impairment on affordable housing investments, the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and operating lease expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in travel expense, professional service fees and loan and lease expense. Card and processing expense decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts. 

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense, refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A.  

Credit Summary  

The provision for loan and lease losses was $343 million and $396 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.39% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 0.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO increased to 0.80% compared to 0.70% at December 31, 2015. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.  

Capital Summary  

The Bancorps capital ratios exceed the well-capitalized guidelines as defined by the PCA requirements of the U.S. banking agencies. As of December 31, 2016, as calculated under the Basel III transition provisions, the CET1 capital ratio was 10.39%, the Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 11.50%, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.02% and the Tier I leverage ratio was 9.90%.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The following are non-GAAP measures which are important to the reader of the Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures.  

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not 

 taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income on an FTE basis, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio to U.S. GAAP:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Pre-provision net revenue is net interest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense. The Bancorp believes this 

 measure is important because it provides a ready view of the Bancorps pre-tax earnings before the impact of provision expense. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of pre-provision net revenue to U.S. GAAP:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it 

 calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the Bancorp became subject to the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2015 which defined various regulatory capital ratios including the CET1 ratio. 

 The CET1 capital ratio has transition provisions that will be phased out over time. The Bancorp is presenting the CET1 capital ratio on a fully phased-in basis for comparative purposes with other organizations. The Bancorp considers the fully phased-in CET1 ratio a non-GAAP measure since it is not the CET1 ratio in effect for the periods presented. Since analysts and the U.S. banking agencies may assess the Bancorps capital adequacy using these ratios, the Bancorp believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards adopted 

 by the Bancorp during 2016 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorps financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. No material changes were made to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2016.  

ALLL  

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorps ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. The Bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.  

The Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgement and is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.  

 Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors 

 may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.  

Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which track the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.  

Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends.  

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.  

The Bancorps primary market areas for lending are the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorps customers. Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the Bancorps ALLL sensitivity analysis.  

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorps ALLL, as previously discussed.

 Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Income Taxes  

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the Bancorp operates are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. The Bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information. The Bancorp maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these items.  

Changes in the estimate of tax accruals occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and other guidance issued by tax authorities and the status of examinations conducted by tax authorities, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations. These changes may significantly impact the Bancorps tax accruals, deferred taxes and income tax expense and may significantly impact the operating results of the Bancorp.  

Deferred taxes are determined using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is calculated based on the difference between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. Significant management judgment is required to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Where management has determined that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance is maintained. For additional information on income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Valuation of Servicing Rights  

When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. Servicing rights resulting from loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Significant management judgement is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS spread and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. In order to assist in this assessment, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the MSR portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the 

 reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. For purposes of measuring impairment, the MSRs are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate) and interest rates. For additional information on servicing rights, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Fair Value Measurements  

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.  

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The level of management judgement necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. Financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) require minimal judgement. The valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgement to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets, and, the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. Table 8 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using Level 3 inputs.

Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments.  

Goodwill  

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the methodology used by the Bancorp to assess goodwill for impairment.  

Impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorps common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorps reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the two-step impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp would be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.  

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorps stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach. 

When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.  

During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Significant management judgement is necessary in the identification and valuation of unrecognized intangible assets and the valuation of the reporting units recorded assets and liabilities. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment process. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps goodwill.  

Legal Contingencies  

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps legal proceedings.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS  

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity.  

Tables 10 and 11 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as the relative impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities included in other assets.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average taxable securities of $3.1 billion and average loans and leases of $981 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps to 50 bps in December 2015 and 25 bps to 75 bps in December 2016. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in average long-term debt of $750 million coupled with a decrease in the net interest rate spread to 2.66% during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.69% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread was driven by a 9 bps increase on rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities partially offset by a 6 bps increase in yields on average interest-earning assets.  

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.88% for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net interest margin was positively impacted by an increase in average free funding balances partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in net interest rate spread coupled with an increase of $2.7 billion in average interest-earning assets. The increase in average free funding balances was driven by increases in average demand deposits and average shareholders equity of $698 million and $727 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $86 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in average loans and leases coupled with an increase in yields on average loans and leases. Average loans and leases increased $981 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and was primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage loans, average commercial construction loans and average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by decreases in average automobile loans and average home equity. Yields on average loans and leases increased 5 bps during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increases in yields on average commercial construction loans, average commercial and industrial loans and average home equity loans partially offset by a decrease in yields on average credit cards which included the impact of a $16 million reduction in interest income related to refunds to be offered to certain bankcard customers. For more information on the Bancorps loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $83 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the previously mentioned increase in average taxable securities, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million in dividends on FRB stock, due to the amended provisions of the Federal Reserve Act governing dividend payments to FRB stockholders.  

Interest expense on core deposits increased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 26 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 24 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits was primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest checking and money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorps deposits.  

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase of 26 bps in the rates paid on average long-term debt coupled with the aforementioned increase in average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorps borrowings. Average wholesale funding represented 26% and 24% of average interest-bearing liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For more information on the Bancorps interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses  

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.  

The provision for loan and lease losses was $343 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $396 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 

 prior year was primarily due to the decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets, which reflected improvement in the national economy and stabilization of commodity prices, and a decrease in outstanding loan balances. The ALLL declined $19 million from December 31, 2015 to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.36%, compared to 1.37% at December 31, 2015.  

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses, including an analysis of loan portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the ALLL.

Noninterest Income  

Noninterest income decreased $307 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table presents the components of noninterest income:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service charges on deposits  

Service charges on deposits decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to a $10 million decrease in consumer deposit fees driven by a decrease in consumer checking fees, partially offset by a $5 million increase in commercial deposit fees driven by new customer acquisition.  

Corporate banking revenue  

Corporate banking revenue increased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. The increase was partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees. Syndication fees increased $32 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of increased activity in the market and gains in specialized business segments. Lease remarketing fees increased $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year and included the impact of $16 million in gains on certain leveraged lease terminations. Additionally, the increase included the impact of impairment charges of $20 million related to certain operating lease equipment that were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $36 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. Letter of credit fees decreased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in outstanding VRDNs. Foreign exchange fees decreased $8 million 

 during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily driven by lower volume coupled with lower currency volatility.  

Wealth and asset management revenue  

Wealth and asset management revenue (formerly investment advisory revenue) decreased $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease of $16 million in securities and brokerage fees driven by lower transactional fees partially offset by an increase in managed account fee-based business. The decrease was partially offset by a $2 million increase in private client service fees and institutional fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The Bancorps Trust, Brokerage and Insurance businesses had approximately $315 billion and $297 billion in total assets under care as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and managed $31 billion and $29 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Card and processing revenue  

Card and processing revenue increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in the number of actively used cards and customer spend volume. 

Mortgage banking net revenue  

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in saleable residential mortgage loan originations. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $10.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $8.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

 Net mortgage servicing revenue is comprised of gross mortgage servicing fees and related MSR amortization as well as valuation adjustments on MSRs and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio.

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Net mortgage servicing revenue decreased $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by a decrease of $63 million in net valuation adjustments, as well as a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees of $23 million. The decrease was partially 

 offset by a decrease in MSR amortization of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. 

The following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, leading to a recovery of temporary impairment on the servicing rights during the year. Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused the modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, which led to a recovery of temporary impairment on the servicing rights during the year.  

Servicing rights are deemed impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate. Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation on the MSR portfolio. 

 Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio.  

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp may acquire various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp did not hold or sell securities related to the non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  

The Bancorps total residential loans serviced at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $69.3 billion and $73.4 billion, respectively, with $53.6 billion and $59.0 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 

Other noninterest income  

The following table presents the components of other noninterest income:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other noninterest income decreased $291 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreases in positive valuation adjustments on the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC, a decrease in the gain on the sale and exercise of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC, decreases in net gains on loan sales and private equity investment income, as well as an increase in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. These decreases were partially offset by increases in the income from the 

 TRA associated with Vantiv, Inc. and a decrease in the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment as well as gains on sales of certain retail branch operations and an increase in operating lease income.  

 The Bancorp recognized positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $64 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the stock warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which utilizes several key inputs (Vantiv, Inc. stock price, strike price of the warrant and several unobservable inputs).

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The positive valuation adjustments for years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to increases of 24% and 40%, respectively, in Vantiv, Inc.s share price from December 31, 2015 to November 22, 2016 and from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition to valuation adjustments, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC. For additional information on the valuation of the warrant, refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Net gains on loan sales decreased $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year as the prior period included the impact of a $37 million gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans classified as TDRs during the first quarter of 2015 which was partially offset by the $11 million gain on the sale of the agent bankcard loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2016.  

Private equity investment income decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to same period in the prior year primarily driven by the recognition of $9 million of OTTI on certain private equity investments in the third quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp recognized $56 million of negative valuation adjustments related to the Visa total return swap compared to $37 million during same period in the prior year. The adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to vacate and reverse the district courts approval of the settlement of an interchange antitrust class action litigation matter on June 30, 2016. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and the 

 related litigation matters, refer to Note 17, Note 18 and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Income from the TRAs associated with Vantiv, Inc. increased $233 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $280 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from existing Vantiv, Inc. TRAs and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a $49 million gain from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the TRA. Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $33 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a $31 million gain during the same period in the prior year.  

Net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment decreased $88 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by impairment charges of $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to impairment charges of $109 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. The impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016. For further information, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Gains on sales of certain retail branch operations of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 included an $11 million gain on the sale of the Bancorps retail operations in the Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank of Pennsylvania during the second quarter of 2016 and an $8 million gain on the sale of the Bancorps retail operations in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank during the first quarter of 2016.  

Operating lease income increased $13 million primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity. 

Noninterest Expense  

Noninterest expense increased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits), technology and communications and other noninterest expense partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and card and processing expense. The following table presents the components of noninterest expense:

This is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  

Personnel costs increased $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in base compensation, primarily due to personnel additions in risk and compliance and information technology, and increased variable compensation, as well as higher retirement and severance costs related to the Bancorps voluntary early retirement program. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 17,844 at December 31, 2016 compared to 18,261 at December 31, 2015. 

 Technology and communications expense increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance and other growth initiatives.  

Net occupancy expense decreased $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in rent expense driven by a reduction in the number of full-service banking centers and ATM locations.

Card and processing expense decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 

 2015 primarily due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts. 

The following table presents the components of other noninterest expense:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other noninterest expense increased $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, impairment on affordable housing investments, the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and operating lease expense partially offset by decreases in travel expense, professional service fees and loan and lease expense.  

FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the implementation of the FDIC surcharge in the third quarter of 2016 as well as an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment base and a favorable settlement of a tax liability related to prior years during the first quarter of 2015. Impairment on affordable housing investments increased $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to incremental losses resulting from previous growth in the portfolio. For further information, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments increased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in estimated loss rates related to unfunded 

 commitments. Losses and adjustments increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of favorable legal settlements for the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by a decrease in legal settlements and reserve expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating lease expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the volume of leases. Travel expense and professional service fees both decreased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to overall expense control. Loan and lease expense decreased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower loan closing and appraisal costs driven by a decline in automobile loan originations.  

The Bancorp continues to focus on efficiency initiatives as part of its core emphasis on operating leverage and expense control. The efficiency ratio on an FTE basis was 61.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 57.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The efficiency ratio on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A. 

Applicable Income Taxes  

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits, partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC.  

 The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were primarily impacted by $182 million and $178 million, respectively, in tax credits and $56 million and $39 million of tax benefits from tax exempt income in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

 The decrease in the effective tax rate from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to a decrease in income before taxes, the increase in tax exempt income, and a change in the estimated deductibility of a prior expense.  

 During 2016, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective as of January 1, 2016. Consistent with existing U.S. GAAP and ASU 2016-09, the Bancorp establishes a deferred tax asset and recognizes a corresponding deferred tax benefit for stock-based awards granted to its employees and directors based on enacted tax rates and the expense recorded for financial reporting purposes. The actual tax deduction for these stock-based awards is determined when the stock-based awards are settled or expired and the tax deductions will typically be greater than or less than the expense previously recognized for financial reporting.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Among other requirements, ASU 2016-09 requires that the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the Bancorps actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the actual tax deduction for stock-based awards was recognized either through additional paid-in-capital when the Bancorp accumulated excess tax benefits from stock based 

 awards or through income tax expense when the Bancorp depleted its accumulated excess tax benefits from stock-based awards.  

The Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future. As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp does not believe it will be necessary to recognize a material impact to tax expense over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards. However, the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the Bancorps stock price and the number of SARs exercised by employees. 

The Bancorps income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows:

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW  

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Wealth and Asset Management (formerly Investment Advisors). Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices or businesses change. In the second quarter of 2016, the Investment Advisors segment name was changed to Wealth and Asset Management to better reflect the services provided by the business segment.  

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorps FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioural assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. The credit rates for several deposit products were reset January 1, 2016 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. These rates were generally higher than those in place during 2015, thus net interest income for deposit-providing business segments was positively impacted during 2016. FTP charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. As overall market rates increased, the FTP charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2016.  

During the first quarter of 2016, the Bancorp refined its methodology for allocating provision expense to the business segments to include charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. The results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were adjusted to reflect this change. Provision expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors are captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.  

The results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were adjusted to reflect changes in internal expense allocation methodologies.

Comparison of the year ended 2016 with 2015  

Net income was $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net income of $718 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net income was driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $193 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in FTP credit rates on core deposits and an increase in average commercial loan and lease balances as well as an increase in their yields of 17 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. These increases in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by an increase in FTP charge rates on loans and leases.  

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $222 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in criticized commercial loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a $102 million charge-off during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 45 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Noninterest income increased $54 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in corporate banking revenue of $52 million driven by increases in lease remarketing fees and syndication fees partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees. 

Noninterest expense increased $57 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in other noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations, impairment on affordable housing investments and operating lease expense partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense.  

Average commercial loans increased $1.6 billion from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $657 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in new origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and line utilization in the first half of the year. Average commercial construction loans increased $926 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increased demand and draw levels continuing to outpace attrition. Average commercial leases increased $121 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $117 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.  

Average core deposits decreased $717 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in average interest checking deposits and average foreign deposits which decreased $487 million and $317 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2015.

Comparison of the year ended 2015 with 2014  

Net income was $718 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net income of $884 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net income was the result of increases in the provision for loan and leases losses and noninterest expense coupled with a decrease in noninterest income.  

Net interest income decreased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a decline in yields of 19 bps on average commercial loans and leases and increases in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances. These decreases for the year ended December 31, 2015 were partially offset by increases in FTP credits on core deposits driven by increases in average balances.  

Provision for loan and lease losses increased $157 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in criticized commercial loans. The increase also included a $102 million charge-off during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007. The year ended December 31, 2014 included net charge-offs related to certain impaired commercial and industrial loans in the first and third quarters of 2014. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 45 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 46 bps for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Noninterest income decreased $27 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to a decrease in corporate banking revenue partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income. Corporate banking revenue decreased $51 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by decreases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. The decrease in syndication fees was the result of decreased activity in the market and the Bancorps reduced leveraged loan appetite. The decrease in lease remarketing fees included the impact of impairment charges of $36 million related to certain operating lease equipment that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The decrease in corporate banking revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by higher institutional sales revenue. Other noninterest income 

 increased $20 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by increases in gains on loan sales.  

Noninterest expense increased $88 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by an increase in other noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations, operating lease expense and impairment on affordable housing investments.

Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $552 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.  

Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was the result of growth in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits which increased $2.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $860 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in average foreign deposits of $1.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014.

Net income was $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by decreases in noninterest expense and the provision for loan and lease losses as well as an increase in noninterest income partially offset by a decrease in net interest income.  

Net interest income decreased $9 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by lower yields on average residential mortgage loans and average automobile loans and a decline in average home equity loans partially offset by decreases in FTP charge rates on loans and leases.  

The provision for loan and lease losses decreased $112 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as the prior year included an $87 million charge-off related to the transfer of 

 certain residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was also due to improved delinquency metrics on residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 22 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 77 bps for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Noninterest income increased $57 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of increases in mortgage banking net revenue and other noninterest income. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $36 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by a $16 million increase in mortgage origination fees and gains on loan sales and a $20 million increase in net mortgage servicing revenue. Other noninterest income increased $21 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a $37 million gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans held for sale classified as TDRs in the first quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in retail service fees.  

Noninterest expense decreased $118 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by a decrease in other noninterest expense of $122 million. The decrease in other noninterest expense was primarily due to decreased legal expenses and operational losses partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead allocations.  

Average consumer loans and leases increased $129 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. Average residential mortgage loans increased $385 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the continued retention of certain agency conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans. Average automobile loans and average home equity loans decreased $176 million and $72 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014 as payoffs exceeded new loan production.

Net income was $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net income of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net income was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income as well as a decrease in noninterest expense partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income.  

Net interest income increased $40 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in FTP credit rates on core deposits and an increase in interest income on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances on average residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans and leases as well as higher yields on average commercial and industrial loans and average other consumer loans and leases. This increase was partially offset by an increase in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances.  

Provision for loan and leases losses decreased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Noninterest income decreased $19 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a $15 million decrease in wealth and asset management revenue driven by a $15 million decrease in securities and brokerage fees as a result of lower transactional fees partially offset by an increase in managed account fee-based business.  

Noninterest expense decreased $33 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by a $31 million decrease in other noninterest expense primarily due to a decrease in corporate overhead allocations partially offset by an increase in operational losses.

Net income was $58 million for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

Net interest income increased $7 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in interest income on loans and leases and FTP credits on demand deposits both due to increases in average balances as well as an increase in FTP credits on 

 interest checking deposits due to an increase in FTP credit rates. These increases were partially offset by increases in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by increases in average balances.  

Provision for loan and leases losses increased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Noninterest income increased $8 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a $9 million increase in wealth and asset management revenue driven by increases in recurring securities brokerage fees and private client service fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $12 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs due to higher incentive compensation and base compensation.  

Average loans and leases increased $535 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans as a result of increases in new loan origination activity partially offset by a decrease in average home equity loans as payoffs exceeded new loan production.

Comparison of the year ended 2016 with 2015  

Net interest income decreased $260 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in FTP credits on deposits allocated to business segments primarily due to an increase in FTP credit rates as well as an increase in interest expense on long-term debt. This decrease in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest income on taxable securities and an increase in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases. The provision for loan and leases losses was $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a benefit of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Noninterest income decreased $359 million from December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares and a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC, both of which were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant with Vantiv Holding, LLC. The decrease was also due to the negative valuation adjustment related to the Visa total return swap of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $37 million for the prior year. In addition, the positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the positive valuation adjustments of $236 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in noninterest income was partially offset by a $280 million gain recognized during the third quarter of 2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from existing Vantiv, Inc. TRAs and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options compared with a $49 million gain recognized by the Bancorp in 2015 for the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the Vantiv, Inc. TRA. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016 and a gain of $33 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a $31 million gain during the prior year. Additionally, equity method earnings from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $3 million from December 31, 2015.  

Noninterest expense was $90 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs and the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.  

Comparison of the year ended 2015 with 2014  

Net interest income decreased $24 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to business segments driven by increases in average deposits. The remaining decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense on long-term debt and a 

 decrease in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases partially offset by an increase in interest income on taxable securities. The provision for loan and leases losses was a benefit of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a benefit of $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to decreases in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments and reductions in the ALLL.  

Noninterest income was $822 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $253 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in noninterest income included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a gain of $125 million in 2014. The positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $236 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC. Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $49 million from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of a TRA and also recognized a gain of $31 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $23 million associated with the TRA during the fourth quarter of 2014. Equity method earnings from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $15 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. Noninterest income also included $37 million in negative valuation adjustments related to the Visa total return swap for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was an expense of $62 million compared to a benefit of $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and an increase in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, donations expense, technology and communications expense and marketing expense. The increase was partially offset by decreased litigation and regulatory activity and increased corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW  

The Bancorps 2016 fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $372 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $501 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2016 and net income available to common shareholders of $634 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis was $909 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 and decreased $4 million from the third quarter of 2016 and increased $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by the impact of refunds to be offered to certain bankcard customers during the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by increased short-term market rates and higher investment securities balances. The increase in net interest income in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by higher investment securities balances and increased short-term market rates, partially offset by the aforementioned bankcard refunds.  

Fourth quarter 2016 noninterest income of $620 million decreased $220 million compared to the third quarter of 2016 and decreased $484 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest income and corporate banking revenue. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of decreases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue.  

Service charges on deposits of $141 million decreased $2 million from the previous quarter and decreased $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decreases in commercial service charges and retail service charges.

Corporate banking revenue of $101 million decreased $10 million compared to the previous quarter and decreased $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease compared to the third quarter was driven by decreases in institutional sales revenue and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange fees. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower lease remarketing fees and letter of credit fees, partially offset by higher foreign exchange fees and institutional sales revenue.  

 Mortgage banking net revenue was $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in mortgage banking net revenue compared to the third quarter of 2016 was driven by lower production gains, partially offset by positive valuation adjustments. The decrease from the prior year was due to lower margins during the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2016 originations were $2.7 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the previous quarter and $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 originations resulted in gains of $30 million on mortgages sold, compared with gains of $61 million during the previous quarter and $37 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross mortgage servicing fees were $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, $49 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include MSR amortization and MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. MSR amortization was $35 million during both the fourth and third quarters of 2016, compared to $29 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments were positive $23 million and negative $9 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2016, respectively, and positive $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Wealth and asset management revenue of $100 million decreased $1 million from the previous quarter and decreased $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline from the third quarter of 2016 was due to a decrease in private client service fees. The year-over-year decrease was due to a decrease in securities and brokerage fees.  

Card and processing revenue of $79 million was flat compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased $2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase from the prior year was driven by an increase in the number of actively used cards and an increase in customer spend volume.  

Other noninterest income of $137 million decreased $199 million compared to the third quarter of 2016 and decreased $465 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter of 2016 results included a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC and a $33 million gain pursuant to Fifth Thirds TRA with Vantiv, Inc. Third quarter of 2016 results included a $280 million gain from the termination and settlement of certain gross cash flows from the existing Vantiv, Inc. TRA and the expected obligation to terminate and settle certain remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options and a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex, partially offset by $28 million in losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and the recognition of $9 million of OTTI on certain private equity investments.

Quarterly results also included valuation adjustments on the Visa total return swap which was a benefit of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a charge of $12 million and $10 million in the third quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.  

The net losses on investment securities were $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net gains of $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Noninterest expense of $960 million decreased $13 million from the previous quarter and decreased $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in noninterest expense compared to the third quarter of 2016 was driven by lower technology and communications expense and seasonally lower marketing expense. The decrease in noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to lower card and processing expense due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts and lower net occupancy expense due to a decrease in rent expense driven by a reduction in the number of full-service banking centers and ATM locations, partially offset by higher personnel costs.  

 The ALLL as a percentage of portfolio loans and leases was 1.36% as of December 31, 2016, compared to 1.37% as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2015 WITH 2014  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $2.01 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.4 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, which was net of $67 million in preferred stock dividends. The provision for loan and lease losses increased to $396 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $315 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as the result of the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007, a broadening global economic slowdown, stress on capital markets and the prolonged softness in commodity prices. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.48% during 2014 compared to 0.64% during the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net interest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in the net interest rate spread, changes made to the Bancorps deposit advance product beginning January 1, 2015 and an increase in average long-term debt of $1.8 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in average taxable securities and average loans and leases of $5.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Noninterest income increased $530 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue. Other noninterest income increased $529 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a gain of $125 million during the second quarter of 2014. Other noninterest income also increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $236 million during 2015 compared to positive valuation adjustments of $31 million during 2014. During the fourth quarter 

 of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC.

Corporate banking revenue decreased $46 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by decreases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $66 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in total personnel costs, technology and communications expense and card and processing expense partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. Personnel costs increased $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by higher executive retirement and severance costs as well as an increase in base compensation and an increase in incentive compensation, primarily in the mortgage business. Technology and communications expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance, and other growth initiatives. Card and processing expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased fraud prevention related expenses. Other noninterest expense decreased $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in losses and adjustments partially offset by increases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, marketing expense, donations expense, impairment on affordable housing investments, FDIC insurance and other taxes and operating lease expense.

 product or collateral. Table 25 summarizes end of period loans and leases, including loans held for sale and Table 26 summarizes average total loans and leases, including loans held for sale. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loans and leases, including loans held for sale, decreased $636 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015. The decrease from December 31, 2015 was the result of a $943 million, or 3%, decrease in consumer loans and leases, partially offset by a $307 million, or 1%, increase in commercial loans and leases.  

Consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in automobile loans, home equity and credit card, partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage loans.

Commercial leases increased $120 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $415 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of a decline in new origination activity due to increased competition and an increase in attrition from deliberate credit exits in the second half of the year. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $87 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.

 classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At December 31, 2016, the Bancorps investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale securities. Securities classified as below investment grade were immaterial at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Bancorps management has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios for OTTI. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bancorps methodology for both classifying investment securities and managements evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI.

Includes interest-only mortgage-backed securities recorded at fair value with fair value changes recorded in securities gains, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 (b)  

Equity securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at cost, FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock holdings and certain mutual fund holdings and equity security holdings.  

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities increased $2.3 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in agency residential and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities.  

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities were 24% and 23% of total interest-earning assets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio was 6.7 years at December 31, 2016 compared to 6.4 years at December 31, 2015. In addition, at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.19%. 

Information presented in Table 29 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale and other securities portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio were $159 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $366 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease from December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

Deposits  

The Bancorps deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises 

 by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Core deposits represented 71% of the Bancorps average asset funding base for both of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. 

The following table presents the end of period components of deposits:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Core deposits increased $830 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015, driven by an increase of $983 million in transaction deposits. 

 Transaction deposits increased from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in savings deposits and demand deposits. 

63 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Money market deposits increased $2.3 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to competitive pricing related to a promotional product offering during 2016 which drove customer acquisition and balance migration from savings deposits from December 31, 2015. Savings deposits decreased $660 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2015. Demand deposits decreased $485 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower balances per customer account. Interest checking deposits included a decrease due to lower balances per account for commercial customers, partially offset by the benefit from a shift from the excess cash in trust accounts managed by Fifth Third to interest checking deposit accounts as a result of the recent enactment of 

 new money market reform. The increase in core deposits from December 31, 2015 included the impact of the sale of $511 million of deposits as part of the branches sold in the St. Louis MSA and Pittsburgh MSA during 2016.  

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $214 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2015. 

The following table presents the components of average deposits for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $86 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase of $127 million in average transaction deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven by increases in average money market deposits and average demand deposits, partially offset by decreases in average interest checking deposits, average savings deposits and average foreign office deposits. Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 8%, primarily due to competitive pricing related to a promotional product offering during 2016 which drove customer acquisition and balance migration from average savings deposits. Average savings deposits decreased $605 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2015. Average demand deposits increased $698 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2015 due to higher average customer balances per commercial customer account. Average 

 interest checking deposits and average foreign office deposits decreased $1.0 billion, or 4%, and $320 million, or 39%, respectively, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in average commercial customer balances per account. The increase in average core deposits from December 31, 2015 included the sale of deposits as part of the St. Louis MSA and Pittsburgh MSA during 2016, which impacted average core deposits by approximately $200 million. Average other deposits increased $276 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in Eurodollar trade deposits. Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $134 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2015 due primarily to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2015.

Upon adoption of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were adjusted to reflect the reclassification of $34, $36, $28 and $25, respectively, of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt. For further information, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Total borrowings increased $587 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in other short-term borrowings partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $2.0 billion, from December 31, 2015 driven by an increase of $2.5 billion in FHLB short-term borrowings partially offset by a $264 million decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term debt decreased 

 $1.4 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the maturity of $3.5 billion of unsecured senior bank notes, the maturity of $250 million of unsecured subordinated bank notes and $1.4 billion of pay downs on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations. The decrease was partially offset by debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $2.8 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes, $750 million of unsecured subordinated fixed-rate bank notes, and $250 million of unsecured senior floating-rate bank notes. For additional information regarding automobile securitizations and long-term debt, refer to Note 11 and Note 16, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For further information, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Total average borrowings increased $1.5 billion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2015, due to increases in average long-term debt and average other short-term borrowings partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds purchased. The increase in average long-term debt of $750 million, or 5%, was driven primarily by the issuances of certain long-term debt as discussed above in the second and third quarter of 2016, partially offset by certain maturities, as previously mentioned, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The level of average federal funds purchased and average other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources 

 are used to satisfy those needs. The increase in average other short-term borrowings, compared to December 31, 2015, of $1.1 billion was primarily due to an increase in FHLB short-term advances.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW  

Managing risk is an essential component of successfully operating a financial services company. The Bancorps risk management approach includes processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The ERM division, led by the Bancorps Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistency and adequacy of the Bancorps risk management approach within the structure of the Bancorps operating model. Management within the lines of business and support functions assess and manage risks associated with their activities and determine if actions need to be taken to strengthen risk management or reduce risk given their risk profile. They are responsible for considering risk when making business decisions and for integrating risk management into business processes. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes.  

The assumption of risk requires robust and active risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of activities, measures and strategies that apply to the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk Appetite Framework, approved by the Board, that provides the foundations of corporate risk capacity, risk appetite and risk tolerances. The Bancorps risk capacity is represented by its available financial resources. Risk capacity sets an absolute limit on risk-assumption in the Bancorps annual and strategic plans. The Bancorp understands that not all financial resources may persist as viable loss buffers over time. Further, consideration must be given to regulatory capital buffers required per Capital Policy Targets that would reduce risk capacity. Those factors take the form of capacity adjustments to arrive at an Operating Risk Capacity which represents the operating risk level the Bancorp can assume while maintaining its solvency standard. The Bancorps policy currently discounts its Operating Risk Capacity by a minimum of 5% to provide a buffer; as a result, the Bancorps risk appetite is limited by policy to, at most, 95% of its Operating Risk Capacity.  

Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial resources required to support the Bancorps risks. The Bancorp measures economic capital under the assumption that it expects to maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. The Bancorps capital policies require that the Operating Risk Capacity less the aforementioned buffer exceed the calculated economic capital required in its business.  

 Risk appetite is the aggregate amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the expectations and goals of its shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and customers, the Bancorps risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise Risk Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative terms; however certain risk types also have quantitative metrics that are used to measure the Bancorps level of risk against its risk tolerances. The Bancorps risk appetite and risk tolerances are supported by risk limits and key risk indicator thresholds. Those limits and thresholds are used to monitor the amount of risk assumed at a granular level. On a quarterly basis, the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board reviews current assessments of each of the eight risk types relative to the established tolerance. Information supporting these assessments, including policy limits, key risk indicators and qualitative factors, is also reported to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board. Any results outside of tolerance require the development of an action plan that describes actions to be taken to return the measure to within the tolerance. 

The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, legal, reputational and strategic. Each of these risks is managed through the Bancorps risk program which includes the following key functions:  

       

ERM is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of risk programs and reporting that facilitate a broad integrated view of risk. The department also leads the continual fostering of a strong risk management culture and the framework, policies and committees that support effective risk governance;  

       

Credit Risk Management is responsible for overseeing the safety and soundness of the commercial and consumer loan portfolio within an independent portfolio management framework that supports the Bancorps loan growth strategies and underwriting practices, ensuring portfolio optimization and appropriate risk controls. Treasury is responsible for the economic capital program. Credit Risk Management is responsible for the quantitative analytics to support the consumer and commercial portfolio and risk rating models, ALLL methodology and analytics needed to assess credit risk and develop mitigation strategies related to that risk. Credit Risk Management also provides oversight, reporting and monitoring of commercial and consumer underwriting and credit administration processes;  

       

Operational Risk Management works with lines of business and regional management to maintain processes to monitor and manage all aspects of operational risk, including vendors and information security to ensure consistency in application of operational risk programs;  

       

Bank Protection oversees and manages fraud prevention and detection and provides investigative and recovery services for the Bancorp;  

       

Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for instituting, monitoring, and reporting appropriate trading limits within the Capital Markets groups and monitoring liquidity, interest rate risk and risk tolerances resulting from management of Fifth Thirds overall balance sheet;  

       

Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure that an enterprise-wide framework, including processes and procedures, are in place to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements; internal policies and procedures; and principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to the Bancorps activities and functions. The Bancorp focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorps integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks; and  

       

The ERM division creates and maintains other functions, committees or processes as are necessary to effectively oversee risk management throughout the Bancorp.  

 Risk management oversight and governance is provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and through multiple management committees whose membership includes a broad cross-section of line-of-business, regional market and support representatives. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors consists of six outside directors and has the responsibility for the oversight of risk management for the Bancorp, as well as for the Bancorps overall aggregate risk profile. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved the formation of key management governance committees that are responsible for evaluating risks and controls. 

66 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The primary committee responsible for the oversight of risk management is the ERMC. Committees accountable to the ERMC, which support the core risk programs, are the Corporate Credit Committee, the Operational Risk Committee, the Management Compliance Committee, the Asset/Liability Committee and the Enterprise Marketing Committee. Other committees accountable to the ERMC oversee the ALLL, capital, model risk and regulatory change management functions. There is also a risk assessment process applicable to every line of business to ensure an appropriate standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a new or changing product or initiative. Significant risk policies approved by the management governance committees are also reviewed and approved by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Credit Risk Review is an independent function responsible for evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs. Credit Risk Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and administratively to the Chief Auditor. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  

The objective of the Bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices. These practices include conservative exposure and counterparty limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority 

 delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate ALLL and take any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorps credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial portfolios using the CCAR model and for certain portfolios, such as Real Estate and Leveraged Lending, the stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The risk grading system currently utilized for allowance for credit loss analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a through-the-cycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrowers creditworthiness. The dual 

 risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category risk rating system. The Bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual risk rating system outputs to develop a U.S. GAAP compliant ALLL model and will evaluate the use of modified dual risk ratings for purposes of determining the Bancorps ALLL as part of the Bancorps adoption of ASU 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which will be effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2020. Scoring systems, various analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the Bancorps homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.  

Overview  

Economic growth continues to improve as data has been broadly positive. There have been steady gains in the job market and real GDP is expected to expand at a moderate pace in 2017. Household spending continues to be the strongest driver of the U.S. economy. Inflation continues to run below the FRBs stated objective, but has increased over the past several months and could rise further if unemployment continues to fall. Improving global conditions are supporting U.S. manufacturing activity and housing prices continue to increase across the country. With regard to commercial real estate, the credit market has become somewhat more selective even though market data and vacancies remain positive.  

Commercial Portfolio  

The Bancorps credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting.  

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multi-national firms to middle market businesses, sole 

 proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio.  

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), sensitivity and pro-forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves.  

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage loans individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorps non-power producing energy and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolios have been identified by the Bancorp as loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the Bancorps commercial loan portfolio due to economic or market conditions within the Bancorps key lending areas.  

Due to the sensitivity of the non-power producing energy portfolio to downward movements in oil prices, the Bancorp saw a 

 migration into criticized classifications during 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. However, in the third and fourth quarters of 2016, this portfolio has stabilized with signs of improvement. The reserve-based energy loans that the Bancorp holds are senior secured loans with a borrowing base that is re-determined on a semi-annual basis.

Consumer Portfolio  

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, 

 monitoring, and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits, and risk committees.  

The Bancorps consumer portfolio is materially comprised of four categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and credit card. 

70 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Bancorp has identified certain categories within these four categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio due to high loan amount to collateral value. The Bancorp does not update LTV ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. Among consumer portfolios, legacy underwritten residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress during the credit crisis. As of December 31, 2016, consumer real estate loans, consisting of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, originated from 2005 through 2008 represent approximately 17% of the consumer real estate portfolio. These loans accounted for 54% of total consumer real estate secured losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Current loss rates in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are below pre-crisis levels. In addition to the consumer real estate portfolio, credit risk management continues to closely monitor the automobile portfolio performance. Increased competition in the marketplace has led to industry-wide loosening of underwriting guidelines. Fifth Third actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigates credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations. 

Residential mortgage portfolio  

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through conservative underwriting and documentation standards and geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.  

The Bancorp does not originate mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Resets of rates on ARMs are not expected to have a material impact on credit costs in the current interest rate environment, as approximately $758 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 98% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately one half of a percent.  

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTV ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in a LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTV ratios and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.  

Portfolio residential mortgage loans from 2010 and later vintages represented 88% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and had a weighted-average LTV of 71% and a weighted-average origination FICO of 759.

Home equity portfolio  

The Bancorps home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorps newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 26% of the balances mature before 2025.  

The aging of 2008 and prior vintages of home equity loans has contributed to declining losses over the past twelve months. These vintages represented 68% of the balances at December 31, 2016 and 95% of the losses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 73% of the balances at December 31, 2015 and 97% of the losses during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is calculated on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable credit losses in the home equity portfolio. The modeled loss factor for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.  

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and 

 those loans with a LTV 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. The carrying value of the greater than 80% LTV home equity loans and 80% or less LTV home equity loans were $2.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Of the total $7.7 billion of outstanding home equity loans:  

   ●    

86% reside within the Bancorps Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as of December 31, 2016;  

   ●    

36% are in senior lien positions and 64% are in junior lien positions at December 31, 2016;  

   ●    

79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the year ended December 31, 2016; and  

   ●    

The portfolio had an average refreshed FICO score of 743 at December 31, 2016.  

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off.

Automobile portfolio  

The Bancorps automobile portfolio balances have declined since December 31, 2015 through targeting more profitable risk-adjusted 

 returns. As a result, the concentration of lower FICO (<690) origination balances have increased with overall credit quality remaining within targeted credit risk tolerance. All concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections. 

The following table provides an analysis of automobile portfolio loans outstanding disaggregated based upon FICO score:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers. As of December 31, 2016, 47% of the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by new 

 automobiles. It is a common industry practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

Credit card portfolio  

The credit card portfolio consists of predominately prime accounts with 97% of loan balances existing within the Bancorps footprint as of December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 78% and 80%, respectively, of the outstanding balances were 

 originated through branch-based relationships with the remainder coming from direct mail campaigns and online acquisitions.

HAMP and HARP Programs  

For residential mortgage loans serviced for FHLMC and FNMA, the Bancorp participates in the HAMP and HARP programs. For loans refinanced under the HARP program, the Bancorp strictly adheres to the underwriting requirements of the program. Loan restructuring under the HAMP program is performed on behalf of FHLMC or FNMA and the Bancorp does not take possession of these loans during the modification process. Therefore, participation in these programs does not significantly impact the Bancorps credit quality statistics and these loans are not included in the Bancorps TDRs as they are not assets of the Bancorp. In the event there is a representation and warranty violation on loans sold through the programs, the Bancorp may be required to repurchase the sold loans. As of December 31, 2016, repurchased loans restructured or refinanced under these programs were immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $12 million and $14 million, respectively, of loans refinanced under HARP were included in loans held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp recognized $6 million of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the sale of loans restructured or refinanced under the HAMP and HARP programs for both periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. 

European Exposure  

The Bancorp has no direct sovereign exposure to any European government as of December 31, 2016. In providing services to our customers, the Bancorp routinely enters into financial transactions with foreign domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign businesses as well as foreign financial institutions. These financial transactions are in the form of loans, loan commitments, letters of credit, derivatives, guarantees, bankers acceptances and securities. The Bancorps risk appetite for foreign country exposure is managed by having established country exposure limits. The Bancorps total exposure to European domiciled or owned businesses and European financial institutions was $2.8 billion and funded exposure was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Bancorp was within its established country exposure limits for all European countries.  

The Bancorp has been closely monitoring the Brexit situation and its potential impact on the Bancorp. The Bancorps United Kingdom exposure is shown in the following table. 

The following table provides detail about the Bancorps exposure to all European domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of European businesses as well as European financial institutions as of December 31, 2016:

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets  

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 57. For further information on the Bancorps policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the 

 Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Nonperforming assets were $751 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $659 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, $13 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $12 million at December 31, 2015.  

 Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of total loans and leases and OREO were 0.80% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 0.70% as of December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 25% of total nonaccrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2016 compared to 43% as of December 31, 2015.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Commercial portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $523 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $182 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases of $170 million in the reserve-based lending energy portfolio and the impact of low oil prices during the year ended 2016.  

Consumer portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $137 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $28 million from December 31, 2015. Refer to Table 58 for a rollforward of the nonaccrual loans and leases.  

OREO and other repossessed property was $78 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $141 million at December 31, 

 2015. The Bancorp recognized $17 million and $24 million in losses on the sale or write-down of OREO properties during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $41 million and $35 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Excludes $71, $77 and $72 of OREO related to government insured loans at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Bancorp has historically excluded government guaranteed loans classified in OREO from its nonperforming asset disclosures. Upon the prospective adoption on January 1, 2015 of ASU 2014-14, Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure, government guaranteed loans meeting certain criteria will be reclassified to other receivables rather than OREO upon foreclosure. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the adoption of this amended guidance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings  

If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. These modifications are classified as TDRs.  

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Commercial loans 

 modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained.  

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $958 million and $979 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past due 30 days or more were 30%, 12% and 30%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs  

Net charge-offs were 39 bps and 48 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Table 61 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category.  

Commercial net charge-offs decreased to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 included a charge-off associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007, included in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases decreased to 33 bps during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 46 bps in the same period in the prior year.  

The ratio of consumer loan and lease net charge-offs to average consumer loans and leases decreased to 48 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 51 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015. Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs, which typically involve partial charge-offs based upon 

 appraised values of underlying collateral, decreased $7 million from December 31, 2015, driven by improvements in delinquencies and loss severities.  

Home equity net charge-offs decreased $12 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to improvements in loss severities. Management actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.  

Automobile loan net charge-offs increased $7 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk adjusted return along with a modest decline in used car values at auction.  

Credit card and other consumer loans and leases net charge-offs remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. The Bancorp utilizes a risk-adjusted pricing methodology to ensure adequate compensation is received for those products that have higher credit costs.

Allowance for Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall ALLL, including an unallocated component. These factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current national and local 

 economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A for more information.  

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp refined certain estimation techniques associated with the ALLL. Such refinements included the introduction of individual loss rate migration analyses for several commercial loan portfolio stratifications as contrasted to the single composite loss rate migration analysis for the entire commercial loan portfolio which was used in prior periods. These refinements did not substantively change any material aspect of the Bancorps overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and there have been no material changes in assumptions as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

79 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

The ALLL attributable to the portion of the residential mortgage and consumer loan and lease portfolio that has not been restructured is determined on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics. Loss factors for consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors. The prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. For real estate backed consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends in 

 its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.  

The Bancorps determination of the ALLL for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. In the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $190 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, the Bancorps determination of the ALLL for residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates would increase by 10%, the ALLL for residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases would increase by approximately $31 million at December 31, 2016. As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Certain inherent but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other qualitative adjustments. Due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-derived estimate of ALLL tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating credit environment, and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. Given these model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results. 

An unallocated component of the ALLL is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. The unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.12%. The unallocated allowance was 9% of the total allowance as of both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

As shown in Table 63, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.36% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.37% at December 31, 2015. The ALLL was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  

Market risk is the day-to-day potential for the value of a financial instrument to increase or decrease due to movements in market factors. The Bancorps market risk includes risks resulting from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, primarily impacts the Bancorps NII and interest sensitive fee income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons:  

   ●    

Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;  

   ●    

Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or  

   ●    

The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.  

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorps earnings. Stability of the Bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management continually reviews 

 the Bancorps balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to reduce this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios. A series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are employed to ensure that this risk is managed within the Bancorps risk tolerance.  

Interest Rate Risk Management Oversight  

The Bancorps ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of market risk activities.  

Net Interest Income Sensitivity  

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorps assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. 

81 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Bancorps interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by measuring the anticipated change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped increases and a 75 bps parallel ramped decrease in interest rates. The analysis would typically include 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped decreases in interest rates; however, this analysis is currently omitted due to the current levels of certain interest rates. Applying the ramps would result in certain interest rates becoming negative in the parallel ramped decrease scenarios.  

In this economic cycle, banks have experienced significant growth in deposit balances, particularly in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The Bancorp, like other banks, is exposed to deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment. In consideration of this risk, the Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $2.5 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances run-off above what is included in senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in 

 short-term market interest rates. These noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances are modeled to flow into funding products that reprice in conjunction with market rate increases.  

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase when market rates increase. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which Bancorp deposit rates will increase for a given increase in short-term market rates. The Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average interest-bearing deposit beta of 69% at December 31, 2016, which is approximately 20 percentage points higher than the beta that the Bancorp experienced in the last FRB tightening cycle from June 2004 to June 2006.  

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also evaluates the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2016, the Bancorps NII would benefit in both year one and year two under the parallel rate ramp increases. The Bancorps NII would decline in both year one and year two under the parallel 75 bps ramped decrease in interest rates. The NII sensitivity profile is attributable to the combination of floating-rate assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, and certain intermediate-term fixed-rate liabilities. The change in the sensitivity as of December 31, 2016 for the first 12 months compared to December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to fixed-rate mortgage asset growth, partially offset by runoff in the indirect automobile loan portfolio. The change in the sensitivity as of December 31, 2016 for the 13-24 month horizon 

 compared to December 31, 2015 is also attributable to fixed-rate mortgage asset growth, partially offset by runoff in the indirect automobile loan portfolio, but sensitivity is modestly improved from December 31, 2015 due to projected core deposit growth.  

Tables 65 and 66 provide information on the Bancorps estimated NII sensitivity profile given changes to certain key deposit modeling assumptions.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity  

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII on an FTE (non-GAAP) basis over one and two year time horizons, EVE is a point in time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer 

 horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of transaction deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The EVE sensitivity to the +200 bps rising rate scenario is moderately negative at December 31, 2016, and is also slightly negative to a 75 bps decline in market rates. The +100 and +200 bps rising rate sensitivities are down slightly from the sensitivities at December 31, 2015. The decrease in risk is related to long-term debt issuances, run-off of indirect automobile loan balances and a shorter average life of certain fixed-rate commercial loans and leases. These items were partially offset by growth in the investment portfolio and fixed-rate mortgage loan balances.  

While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could 

 mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates.  

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impact on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.  

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk  

An integral component of the Bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options.  

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which 

 the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. For further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk  

Although the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established. 

The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases expected cash flows, excluding interest receivable, as of December 31, 2016:

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk  

The net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $744 million and $784 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates. 

 Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, leading to a recovery of temporary impairment on the servicing rights during the year. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate. In addition to the MSR valuation, the Bancorp recognized net gains of $24 million and $90 million on derivatives associated with its non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on MSRs.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorps foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $827 million and $812 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive 

 risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by the Capital Markets Credit Department and Capital Markets Risk Department.  

Commodity Risk  

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by the Capital Markets Credit Department and Capital Markets Risk Department. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash, investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that assesses the liquidity needs under various scenarios of market conditions, asset growth and credit rating downgrades. The plan includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and uses of funds under the different scenarios. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity.  

Sources of Funds  

The Bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings.  

Table 68 of the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. Of the $31.2 billion of securities in the Bancorps available-for-sale and other portfolio at December 31, 2016, $4.1 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $3.3 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorps securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorps ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive 

 assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. The Bancorp sold or securitized loans totaling $7.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. For further information on the transfer of financial assets, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds. The Bancorps average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded 82% of its average total assets for both years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include securitized advances from the FHLB system. Certificates of deposit $100,000 and over and deposits in the Bancorps foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.  

As of December 31, 2016, $8.9 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current Bancorps Board of Directors authorizations and the Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. At December 31, 2016, the Bancorp has approximately $42.3 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the FHLB and FRB.  

The Banks global bank note program has a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $17.1 billion is available for issuance as of December 31, 2016. On March 15, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured bank notes. On June 14, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.3 billion of unsecured bank notes. On September 27, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.0 billion of unsecured bank notes.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio  

A key reform within the Basel III framework to strengthen international liquidity standards was the BCBS introduction of the LCR and NSFR. On January 7, 2013, the BCBS issued a final standard for the LCR applicable to large internationally active banking organizations. The BCBS issued a final NSFR standard in the fourth quarter of 2014 and disclosure requirements in the second quarter of 2015 which are applicable to internationally active banks. The NSFR will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.  

Section 165 of the DFA requires the FRB to establish enhanced liquidity standards in the U.S. for BHCs with total assets of $50 billion or greater. On October 10, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies published final rules implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the LCR standard established by the BCBS for large internationally active banking organizations, generally those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. In addition, a Modified LCR requirement was finalized for BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets that are not internationally active, such as the Bancorp. The Modified LCR requires BHCs to maintain HQLA equal to its calculated net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor of 0.7. The Modified LCR became effective January 1, 2016 and requires BHCs to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. The final rule includes a transition period for the Modified LCR in which BHCs must maintain HQLA of 90% of its calculated net cash outflows for 2016 and then 100% beginning in 2017. The Bancorps Modified LCR was 128% at December 31, 2016 calculated under the LCR final rule.  

The U.S. banking agencies have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a modified NSFR for certain bank holding companies with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and with less than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposures, including the Bancorp. The NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance-sheet activities of banks and bank holding companies over a one-year time horizon. Generally consistent with the BCBS framework, under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of ASF over a one-year time horizon that equals or exceeds the institutions amount of RSF, with the ASF representing the numerator and the RSF representing the denominator of the NSFR. Banking 

 organizations subject to the modified NSFR would multiply the RSF amount by 70%, such that the RSF amount required for these institutions would be equivalent to 70% of the RSF amount that would be required pursuant to the full NSFR generally applicable to institutions with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures under the proposed rule. The proposed rule includes detailed descriptions of the items that would comprise ASF and RSF and standardized factors that would apply to ASF and RSF items, and would require any institution whose applicable modified NSFR falls under 100% to notify the appropriate federal regulator and develop a remediation plan.  

If ultimately adopted as currently proposed, the implementation of the NSFR could impact the Bancorps liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future, including by incentivizing increased use of long-term debt as a funding source. Under the proposal, the NSFR becomes effective January 1, 2018 with public disclosure requirements beginning for the calendar quarter that ends on March 31, 2018. The comment period for this proposal ended on August 5, 2016. The Bancorp is currently evaluating the impact of the U.S. banking agencies NSFR framework.  

Credit Ratings  

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorps or Banks credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorps or Banks financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.  

The Bancorps and Banks credit ratings are summarized in Table 70. The ratings reflect the ratings agencys view on the Bancorps and Banks capacity to meet financial commitments.*  

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems or due to external events that are neither market nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorps activities and can manifest itself in various ways including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, cyber-security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of vendors to perform in accordance 

 with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorps risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorps risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject. 

86 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

To control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions, and to provide independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day to day operational risk (first line of defense).  

The Bancorps risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorps approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support 

 implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Vendor Risk Management and operational losses. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorps goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorps performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred. 

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT  

Regulatory compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Thirds activities and functions. Fifth Third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorps integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Bancorps risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorps risk appetite.  

The current regulatory environment, including heightened regulatory expectations and material changes in laws and regulations, increases compliance risk. To mitigate compliance risk, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program and ensures that lines of business, regions and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring 

 compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. The lines of business and enterprise functions are responsible for managing the compliance risks associated with their areas. Additionally, Compliance Risk Management implements key compliance programs and processes including but not limited to risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, anti-money laundering, privacy and oversees the Bancorps compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.  

Fifth Third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Fifth Third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments (in coordination with the Regulatory Change Management Committee), regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  

Management regularly reviews the Bancorps capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.  

Regulatory Capital Ratios  

The Basel III Final Rule was effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of its components and other provisions. It established quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items and also defined and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. The minimum capital ratios established under the Basel III Final Rule are 4.5% for the CET1 capital ratio, 6% for the Tier I risk-based capital ratio, 8% for the Total risk-based capital ratio and 4% for the Tier I Leverage ratio (Tier I capital to quarterly average consolidated assets). The PCA provisions adopted by the U.S. banking agencies define well-capitalized ratios for CET1 capital, Tier I risk-based capital, Total risk-based 

 capital and Tier I leverage greater than or equal to 6.5%, 8%, 10% and 5%, respectively.  

On January 1, 2016, the Bancorp became subject to a capital conservation buffer which will be phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased-in, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements, in order to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is 0.625% in 2016. The Bancorp exceeded these well-capitalized and capital conservation buffer ratios for all periods presented.  

 The Bancorp made a one-time permanent election to not include AOCI in regulatory capital in the March 31, 2015 FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C filings. The Basel III Final Rule phases out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I capital. Under these provisions, these TruPS would qualify as a component of Tier II capital. At December 31, 2016, the Bancorps TruPS no longer qualified for Tier I capital, compared to $13 million, or 1 bp of risk-weighted assets, which qualified as Tier I capital at December 31, 2015.

For further information, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Stress Tests and CCAR  

In 2011 the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHCs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Further, each BHC must also report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. The FRB launched the 2016 stress testing program and CCAR on January 28, 2016, with submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the FRB due on April 5, 2016, which the Bancorp submitted as required. Refer to Note 3 and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the FRBs review of the capital plan, the FRBs non-objection to the Bancorps proposed capital actions and the Bancorps capital actions taken in 2016. 

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program  

The Bancorps common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.53 and $0.52 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchases.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial transactions that are considered off-balance sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorps Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorps off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments, contingent liabilities, guarantees and transactions with non-consolidated VIEs. A brief discussion of these transactions is as follows:  

Commitments  

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale, noncancelable operating lease obligations, capital commitments for private equity investments, purchase obligations, capital expenditures, and capital lease obligations. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on commitments.  

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities  

For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers are required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In some instances, these insurers ceded a portion of the PMI premiums to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provided reinsurance coverage within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorps reinsurance coverage typically ranged from 5% to 10% of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorps maximum exposure in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the Bancorps total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $27 million at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Bancorp maintained a reserve of $2 million related to exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the second quarter of 2016, the Bancorp allowed one of 

 its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement with the Bancorp, resulting in the Bancorp releasing collateral to the insurer in the form of investment securities and other assets with a carrying value of $6 million, and the insurer assuming the Bancorps obligations under the reinsurance agreement, resulting in a decrease to the Bancorps reserve liability of $2 million and a decrease in the Bancorps maximum exposure of $26 million. In addition, the Bancorp received a payment of $4 million related to the difference between the release of the assets and the reserve liability assumed. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the final policies under the reinsurance agreement were terminated and as of December 31, 2016 the Bancorp no longer had any remaining exposure or reserves related to exposure within the reinsurance portfolio.  

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.  

Transactions with Non-consolidated VIEs  

The Bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on non-consolidated VIEs.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. The aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2016 are shown in Table 73. As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the 

 effective tax rate in future periods. Due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the following table.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorps management, including the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to management on a timely basis. Based on the evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of deficiencies in the Bancorps policies and procedures relating to the registration of, and prospectus delivery with respect to, the Bancorps employee benefit plans as described in Part II, Item 5 (Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities).  

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Bancorps management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. Managements assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. The Bancorps independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Bancorps consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. This report appears on page 93 of the annual report.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
