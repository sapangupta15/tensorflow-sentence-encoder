BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OVERVIEW

Strategy and Goals

Our vision is to create a safer and cleaner future as efficient providers of reliable transportation fuel solutions. To achieve this vision, we are pursuing the following strategic goals and priorities:

•improve operational efficiency and effectiveness by focusing on safety and reliability, system improvements and cost leadership;

•drive commercial excellence by strengthening our supply, trading and optimization activities to provide additional value to the business;

•maintain our financial position by exercising capital discipline and focusing on a balanced use of free cash flow;

•capture value-driven growth through a focus on our logistics assets, growing our marketing business and other strategic opportunities accretive to shareholder value; and

•maintain a high performing culture by building leadership at all levels of the organization with employees from diverse backgrounds and experiences who are accountable for delivering on our commitments.

Our goals were focused on these strategic priorities and we accomplished the following during 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 40
Additionally, we accomplished the following during 2014 in line with our strategic objectives:

•Purchased 8.4 million shares of our common stock and paid $0.30 per share and $0.25 per share quarterly dividends in the second half and first half of the year, respectively;

•Completed the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2024, and redeemed the outstanding 9.750% Senior Notes due 2019;

•TLLP completed its acquisition of the West Coast Logistics Assets from Tesoro for a purchase price of $270 million; and

•TLLP redeemed $130 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 using proceeds of its August 2014 issuance of 2.1 million common units.

Business Improvement Objectives

During 2014, we estimate that we delivered $560 million towards our ongoing initiatives around synergy and business improvement objectives, including approximately $235 million related to synergies in our California operations, approximately $205 million related to the enhancement of gross margins, and approximately $120 million related to business improvements. These initiatives focus on improving capture rates and managing our costs to drive improvements in operating income. Our 2014 achievements include the following:

•Achieved total synergies and business improvements in excess of original targets;

•Increased overall refining capture rates during 2014 compared to 2013 through the following:

◦Enhanced our abilities to blend and move gasoline and jet supplies through new feedstock and product interconnections between the Carson and Wilmington facilities; and

◦Improved the product flexibility between gasoline and distillates at our Los Angeles refinery.

•Completed majority of Los Angeles synergy improvements allowing enhanced crude oil, feedstock and product movements into and around our Los Angeles facilities through the following:

◦Optimized in-bound crude oil movements across the marine docks acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition (as defined on page 48) providing opportunities for our Wilmington facility to source different grades of crude oil;

◦Diversified the revenue stream for the Los Angeles logistics system by opening the system to third-party business and expansion of TLLP’s San Diego terminal;

◦Re-distributed feedstocks between facilities within our west coast system during maintenance and turnaround activities to optimize inventory utilization; and

◦Improved procurement and scheduling activities across the business.

•Realized full-year benefit from the completion of the phase one expansion of the Salt Lake City waxy crude project;

•Realized full-year benefit from the expansion of the Mandan distillate desulfurization unit allowing increased distillate production and the refinery to run an additional 3 thousand barrels per day (“Mbpd”) of total throughput;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Achieved value-driven growth through our interest in TLLP with its continued focus on organic growth projects and acquisition of logistics assets from us.

In December 2014, we laid out our plans to deliver an additional $550 to $670 million of annual improvements during 2015. These improvements are in addition to what was delivered in 2014 and include $95 to $125 million from delivering West Coast improvements, $130 to $170 million from capturing margin improvements, and $325 to $375 million by growing our logistics operations.

Current Market Conditions

Over the second half of 2014, the price of a barrel of oil dropped by more than 50%. This type of price decline can have a pronounced impact on producers and several have announced capital program reductions. However, the corresponding fall in gasoline prices could bolster demand in domestic markets. Crack spreads on the West Coast remain positive and the transition into driving season as well as the switch to summer-grade gasoline could cause demand to continue to increase. While the rapid decline in crude oil prices has provided operational challenges that we have sought to manage, to-date we have not experienced any adverse material effects on our abilities to meet our goals and objectives outlined above.

Collective bargaining agreements for hourly represented employees at several of our plants expired on January 31, 2015. Even though we were in the midst of good faith negotiations, we, along with several other U.S. refiners, received strike notifications on February 1, 2015. These notifications included our Anacortes and Martinez refineries and the Carson portion of our Los Angeles refinery. We have a contingency plan that has prepared us to safely operate our facilities during this work stoppage and we have safely transitioned to this plan at our Anacortes refinery and the Carson portion of our Los Angeles refinery. Since our Martinez refinery was undergoing extensive planned maintenance when the strike was called, we chose to idle the remaining units and convert the refinery to terminal operations as we believe it was the safest option. We are currently developing plans to restart the refinery. Any prolonged strike, work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Tesoro Logistics LP

TLLP was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets to gather crude oil and distribute, transport and store crude oil and refined products. Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), a fully consolidated subsidiary, serves as the general partner of TLLP. We held an approximate 36% interest in TLLP at December 31, 2014, including a 2% general partner interest. Our ownership interest in TLLP included subordinated units that were converted to common units during the second quarter of 2014 and thereafter participate on terms equal with all other common units in distributions of available cash. At the time of conversion, our ownership interest in TLLP and financial position were not impacted. In 2014, 83% of TLLP’s revenue was derived from us primarily under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include minimum volume commitments. With the acquisition of the natural gas gathering, processing, treating and transportation and crude oil gathering assets comprising the Rockies Natural Gas Business (as defined below), TLLP expects to derive approximately 50% of revenues from us. Additionally, in the future, TLLP believes revenues from QEP Resources, Inc. will be significant to its total revenues.

TLLP’s strategy remains to grow earnings through four ways that have remained constant since its 2011 initial public offering:

•Focusing on stable, fee-based business;

•Optimizing our existing asset base;

•Pursuing organic expansion opportunities; and 

•Continued growth through strategic acquisitions.

By achieving this growth and through our ownership of TLLP’s general partner, we expect the logistics operations to maximize the integrated value of assets within the midstream and downstream value chain. This includes creating shareholder value through the lower cost of capital available to TLLP as a limited partnership and receipt of TLLP’s quarterly distributions. As the distributions per unit increase, our proportion of the total distribution will grow at an accelerated rate due to our incentive distribution rights. We believe TLLP is well positioned to achieve its primary business objectives and execute business strategies based on its long-term fee-based contracts, relationship with us, assets positioned in the high demand Williston Basin, and financial flexibility.

 42
Total market value of TLLP units held by Tesoro was $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014, Tesoro held 28,181,748 common units at a market value of $58.85 per unit based on the closing unit price as of that date. In connection with TLLP’s acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business (as defined below), Tesoro purchased 8.7 million common units totaling $500 million and made a $27 million contribution to maintain its 2% general partner interest in TLLP. At December 31, 2013, Tesoro held 3,855,824 common units and 15,254,890 subordinated units at a market value of $52.34 per unit based on the closing unit price as of that date. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash distributions received from TLLP, including incentive distribution rights, is as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________________[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2014, TLLP accomplished the following (refer to Notes 3 and 13 of the financial statements in Item 8 for further information):

•acquired the natural gas gathering, processing, treating and transportation and crude oil gathering assets of QEPFS for $2.5 billion transforming TLLP into a full-service logistics company with additional revenue diversification;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•purchased certain terminalling and pipeline assets owned by Tesoro and two of our subsidiaries for $270 million during the third quarter of 2014; and

•launched the continuous offering program in June 2014 authorizing the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $200 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of its offerings.

Acquisition of Rockies Natural Gas Business. On October 19, 2014, TLLP entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) with QEP Field Services Company (“QEPFSC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QEP Resources, Inc. Pursuant to the MIPA, TLLP agreed to purchase QEP Field Services LLC (“QEPFS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QEPFSC. QEPFS is the direct or indirect owner of assets related to, and entities engaged in, natural gas gathering, transportation and processing in or around the Green River Basin located in Wyoming and Colorado, the Uinta Basin located in eastern Utah, and the portion of the Williston Basin located in North Dakota (the “Rockies Natural Gas Business”). The Rockies Natural Gas Business also provides natural gas liquids fractionation and transportation services for its producer customers through direct ownership and operation of two gathering systems and two processing complexes. The acquisition transforms TLLP into a full-service logistics company with assets allowing geographic and revenue diversification in support of our strategic initiatives. TLLP completed the transaction on December 2, 2014. As part of the transaction, TLLP acquired 56% of the limited partner interests in QEP Midstream Partners, LP (“QEPM”). Additionally, TLLP acquired the general partner of QEPM including its 2% general partner interest and 100% of the incentive distribution rights. TLLP paid total consideration of $2.5 billion, including environmental obligations, existing legal obligations and approximately $230 million to refinance QEPM’s outstanding debt. In connection with the acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business, TLGP will waive its right to $10 million of general partner distributions with respect to incentive distribution rights during 2015 (pro rata on a quarterly basis). TLGP will begin to waive general partner distributions with the first quarter 2015 quarterly distribution.

Equity Issuances. On October 24, 2014 in connection with its acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business, TLLP closed a registered public offering of 23.0 million common units representing limited partner interests in TLLP (the “October Equity Offering”) to raise $1.3 billion, including the purchase of common units by Tesoro of an amount equal to $500 million and TLGP’s $27 million contribution to maintain its 2% general partner interest in TLLP.

On August 22, 2014, TLLP completed a public offering of 2.1 million common units for net proceeds of $142 million. Using the proceeds from the offering, TLLP redeemed an aggregate principal amount of $130 million of the TLLP 2020 Notes at a premium. TLLP recorded charges for premiums paid due to the early redemption and expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs totaling $10 million. We reimbursed TLLP through a capital contribution of $8 million related to the early debt redemption premiums.

 43
On June 25, 2014, TLLP filed a prospectus supplement to its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in 2012, authorizing the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $200 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of its offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2014, TLLP issued 199,400 common units under this program for net proceeds of $14 million.

Vancouver Energy

Consistent with our strategic priorities to drive commercial excellence and capture value-driven growth, we entered into an equally-owned joint venture in 2013 with Savage Companies to construct, own and operate a unit train unloading and marine loading terminal at Port of Vancouver, USA (the “Vancouver Energy” terminal) with a total capacity of 360 Mbpd allowing for the delivery of cost-advantaged North American crude oil to the U.S. West Coast. Our contribution to the project is expected to be between $95 million and $105 million. These cost estimates include the entire project scope and requirements necessary to comply with American Society of Civil Engineering and International Building Codes for seismic risks in the area. Our contributions, totaling $5 million during 2014, are considered investments in joint ventures and are presented in net cash used in investing activities in our statements of consolidated cash flows.

The project is progressing through the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (“EFSEC”) permitting process in the state of Washington. During the second quarter of 2014, EFSEC approved the land-use consistency indicating the planned facility is in line with Vancouver, Washington zoning requirements. Additionally, EFSEC issued the Draft Environmental Impact Statement scoping report. We submitted the majority of our Preliminary Draft Environmental Impact Statement to EFSEC in July 2014 and the remaining portion in September 2014. EFSEC has begun the adjudicative phase and based on the schedule it laid out is expected to release the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in May 2015. We expect EFSEC will submit its recommendation to the governor of Washington once it completes the adjudicative phase. The joint venture will begin construction of the facilities upon the governor’s approval of the project and issuance of permits. Project construction is estimated to take nine to twelve months, however initial operations are expected to begin within a few months of construction start.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.

Non-GAAP Measures

Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze operating segment performance. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), our management uses additional metrics that are known as “non-GAAP” financial metrics in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (“EBITDA”). We define EBITDA as consolidated earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest and financing costs, income taxes and interest income. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus or minus amounts determined to be “special items” by our management based on their unusual nature and relative significance to earnings (loss) in a certain period. We provide complete reconciliation and discussion of items identified as special items with our presentation of adjusted EBITDA.

We present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe some investors and analysts use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and use cash for other purposes, including capital expenditures. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to U.S. GAAP net earnings or net cash from operating activities. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and net cash from operating activities.

Items Impacting Comparability

As of December 31, 2013, we began reporting the logistics assets and operations of TLLP as a separate operating segment. In previous periods, when certain quantitative thresholds had not been met, TLLP’s assets and operations were presented within our refining operating segment (“Refining”). TLLP’s assets and operations include certain crude oil gathering assets and crude oil and refined products terminalling and transportation assets acquired from Tesoro and third parties. The historical results of operations of these assets have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to current presentation. These adjustments resulted in lower gross refining margins. The refining segment now includes costs for transportation and terminalling services provided by TLLP that were previously eliminated with consolidated reporting of TLLP revenues within our refining segment results.

The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of TLLP contained herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired in the acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods presented. The TLLP financial data is derived from the combined financial results of the TLLP predecessor (the “TLLP Predecessor”). We refer to the TLLP Predecessor and, prior to each acquisition date, the acquisitions from Tesoro collectively, as “TLLP’s Predecessors”.

On September 25, 2013, we completed the sale of all of our interest in Tesoro Hawaii, LLC, which operated a 94 thousand barrel per day Hawaii refinery, retail stations and associated logistics assets (the “Hawaii Business”). We have reflected its results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented, and, unless otherwise noted, we have excluded the Hawaii Business from the financial and operational data presented in the tables and discussion that follow.

2014 Compared to 2013

Overview. Our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation in 2014 were $872 million, or$6.67 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $392 million, or $2.85 per diluted share in 2013.

Gross Margins. Our gross refining margin increased $942 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by higher refined product sales volumes resulting from full year operations of our integrated Southern California refining, marketing and logistics business we acquired on June 1, 2013 from BP West Coast Products, LLC and other affiliated sellers (the “Los Angeles Acquisition”). The increase was further improved by an increase of $1.54 in our gross refining margin per barrel during 2014 due to a stronger margin environment throughout most of 2014. The increases in refining gross margin during 2014 were partially offset by a $42 million lower of cost or market adjustment related to inventory given the lower price environment we experienced during second half of 2014. Our retail gross margin increased $344 million due to higher fuel margins as well as higher fuel sales volumes resulting from our expanded retail network. TLLP increased operating income by $132 million due to higher throughput volumes driven by acquired assets and continued expansion of its crude oil gathering and terminalling assets.

Other Costs and Expenses. Operating expenses increased by $491 million, or 26%, to $2.4 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a full year of operations of the assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition. The Los Angeles Acquisition also increased selling, general and administrative expenses, which was partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $24 million during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily attributable to our stock appreciation rights. Our stock appreciation rights are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period using a Black-Scholes model where stock price is a significant assumption. Our stock price increased 27% during 2014 compared to a 33% increase during 2013. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $73 million due to increased depreciation expense associated with assets acquired with the Los Angeles Acquisition.

Interest and financing costs, net.  Interest and financing costs increased approximately $86 million to $235 million during 2014 from $149 million during 2013. The increase consisted primarily of a $39 million charge for premiums paid, unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to the redemption of the 9.750% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and TLLP 2020 Notes in 2014. Additionally, incremental interest expense of $32 million was incurred during 2014 compared to 2013 associated with the TLLP 2020 Notes and TLLP’s 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “TLLP 2021 Notes”) issued during the second half of 2013. TLLP used these borrowings to finance its acquisition of logistics assets from us that we acquired in connection with the Los Angeles Acquisition. Further increases of $28 million resulted from the issuance of TLLP’s 5.500% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “TLLP 2019 Notes”), TLLP’s 6.250% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “TLLP 2022 Notes”) and related bridge fees in connection with TLLP’s Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition. During 2014, our interest costs reflected a net savings compared to 2013 of $10 million as a result of refinancing the 2019 Notes with the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) in March 2014.

Other Income. Other income during 2014 included a refund and settlement from a crude pipeline network rate case settlement of $59 million that was comparable to a refund from the settlement of a rate proceeding from the California Public Utilities Commission of $54 million during 2013. Additionally, 2013 included the release of a $16 million legal reserve as a result of a favorable settlement of litigation.

Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense totaled $547 million in 2014 versus $246 million in 2013. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 37.4% and 36.2% during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Compared to 2013, the 2014 rate included a reduced share of income from non-taxable noncontrolling interests attributable to TLLP.

Earnings (loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax. Losses from discontinued operations related to the Hawaii Business, net of tax, were $29 million in 2014, compared to earnings of $20 million in 2013. The loss in 2014 primarily related to $42 million in charges related to regulatory improvements we are obligated to make at the at the Hawaii refinery to resolve the Clean Air Act matters discussed in Note 17 in Item 8. The earnings in 2013 included an $81 million gain on the sale of the Hawaii Business, which included a $17 million curtailment gain related to the remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

 48
2013 Compared to 2012

Overview. Our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation in 2013 were $392 million ($2.85 per diluted share) compared with net earnings of $876 million ($6.20 per diluted share) in 2012.

Gross Margins. Our gross refining margin decreased $385 million during 2013 compared to 2012 driven by lower industry margins. The increase in refined product sales volume was offset by a decrease of $5.92 in our gross refining margin per barrel during 2013 caused by a lower margin environment and lower discounts on advantaged crude oil. Our gross retail margin increased $54 million due to higher fuel sales volumes resulting from higher average station count from the Los Angeles Acquisition and the transition of additional retail stations in the second half of 2012. TLLP increased operating income by $17 million due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance costs, which include TLLP Predecessors’ costs.

Other Costs and Expenses. Operating expenses increased by $506 million, or 36%, to $1.9 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher operating expenses resulting from the Los Angeles Acquisition. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40 million, or 13%, to $337 million in 2013 from $297 million in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to transaction and integration costs of $62 million related to the Los Angeles Acquisition and TLLP’s acquisition of the Northwest Products System during 2013. The increase was offset by lower stock-based compensation expense, which decreased by $20 million during 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily attributable to our stock appreciation rights. Our stock price increased 33% during 2013 compared to an 89% increase during 2012. Other increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were driven by an increase in headcount during 2013 as compared to 2012.

Interest and Financing Costs, Net. Net interest and financing costs decreased $16 million, or 10%, to $149 million in 2013 from $165 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by a $27 million charge for premiums paid and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of our 6.625% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes in 2012. This reduction in expense was partially offset by interest expense on borrowings outstanding during 2013 under the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and our term loan credit facility agreement (the “Term Loan Facility”), which were used to finance the Los Angeles Acquisition, in addition to TLLP debt totaling $800 million to fund their acquisitions of the Los Angeles Terminal Assets and Los Angeles Logistics Assets.

Other Income (Expense), Net. We recorded other income, net, of $63 million in 2013 compared to other expense, net of $26 million in 2012. The increase was driven by a refund from the settlement of a rate proceeding from the California Public Utilities Commission of $54 million and the release of a $16 million legal reserve as a result of the favorable settlement of litigation during 2013. Other expense, net, of $26 million recorded in 2012, includes accruals related to certain legal matters partially offset by receipts associated with the settlement of a pipeline rate proceeding during the year. 

Income Tax Expense.  Income tax expense from continuing operations was $246 million in 2013 compared to $527 million in 2012. The combined federal and state effective income tax rates were 36.2% and 36.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2013 and 2012 rates benefited from an increased share of income from noncontrolling interests attributable to TLLP.

Earnings (loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax. Earnings from discontinued operations related to the Hawaii Business, net of tax, were $20 million in 2013, compared to losses of $133 million in 2012. The earnings in 2013 comprised of an $81 million gain on the sale of the Hawaii Business during 2013, which includes a $17 million curtailment gain related to the remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and a benefit from a downward asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) adjustment of $14 million partially offset by operating losses that were incurred prior to the sale on September 25, 2013. Losses in 2012 are attributed to $248 million in impairment charges partially offset by operating income of $30 million. At the end of 2012, based on the values observed from indicative bids to purchase the Hawaii Business, we concluded the fair value of the long-lived assets was zero resulting in the impairment recognized.

 49
Refining Segment

We currently own and operate six petroleum refineries with a combined crude oil capacity of 850 Mbpd located in the western United States and sell transportation fuels to a wide variety of customers. Our refineries produce the majority of the transportation fuels that we sell. We purchase crude oil and other feedstocks from domestic and foreign sources, including the Middle East, South America, Canada, western Africa, and other locations either through term agreements with renewal provisions or in the spot market. Our retail network provides a committed outlet for the majority of the gasoline produced by our refineries; however, we also sell gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils and residual products in both the bulk and wholesale markets in the western United States. We also opportunistically export refined products to certain foreign markets.

Market Overview. Our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and aggregate value of products we make from that crude oil and is affected by changes in economic conditions and supply and demand balance. Product values and crude oil prices are set by the market and are outside of our control.

Our Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest refineries have benefited from processing inland U.S. and Canada crude oil priced on the basis of West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) resulting in discounts compared to benchmark Brent crude oil (“Brent”) processed at our coastal refineries. The WTI discount to Brent averaged approximately $7 per barrel during 2014, compared to approximately $11 per barrel during 2013.

We supply our North Dakota refinery exclusively with Bakken crude oil, our Washington refinery primarily with Bakken and Canadian Light Sweet crude oil and our Utah refinery with light sweet crude oil from Wyoming and Colorado as well as Uinta Basin waxy crude oil. In 2014, the average discount of Bakken crude oil to WTI widened to about $6 per barrel, compared to an average discount of about $5 per barrel in 2013. The average discount of Canadian Light Sweet crude oil to WTI narrowed to about $7 per barrel in 2014, compared to approximately $8 per barrel during 2013. Our California refineries run a significant amount of light crude oil from Alaskan North Slope (“ANS”) and light crude oil from Iraq (“Basrah”) as well as South American heavy (“Oriente”) and San Joaquin Valley Heavy (“SJVH”) crude oil, which have historically priced at a discount to Brent.

Operational Data and Results. Management uses various measures to evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare profitability to other companies in the industry, including gross refining margin per barrel, manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense (“Manufacturing Costs”) per barrel and refined product sales margin per barrel. We calculate gross refining margin per barrel by dividing gross refining margin (revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput. We calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput. We calculate refined product sales margin per barrel by dividing refined product sales margin by total refining throughput. Refined product sales margin represents refined product sales less refined product cost of sales. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

2014 Compared to 2013

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased $415 million, or 48%, to $1.3 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of higher gross margins, which exceeded increased manufacturing costs and other operating expenses in 2014 resulting from our expanded operations. Total refinery utilization was 97% in 2014 as compared to 95% in 2013 primarily as a result of reduced turnaround activities, operational efficiencies and reliability.

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 128 Mbpd, or 18%, to 825 Mbpd in 2014 as compared to 697 Mbpd in 2013. The increase is primarily due to higher throughput in the California region following the Los Angeles Acquisition, including a 266 Mbpd refinery, combined with higher throughput at the Washington and Utah refineries due to scheduled turnarounds in 2013 that lowered the 2013 throughput.

Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $3.2 billion, or 9% to $38.1 billion in 2014 as compared to $35.0 billion in 2013, primarily due to increased refined product sales volumes of 141 Mbpd, or 17%, to 949 Mbpd in 2014 as compared to 808 Mbpd in 2013 primarily as a result of the Los Angeles Acquisition. The increase in refined product sales volumes was partially offset by a decrease in the average product sales price of $6.23 per barrel, or 5%, to $112.17 per barrel in 2014 as compared to $118.40 per barrel in 2013.

 54
Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales decreased $7.05 per barrel, or 6%, to $102.59 per barrel in 2014 as compared to $109.64 per barrel in 2013, reflecting decreases in crude oil prices as well as gains on derivative contracts used to hedge our exposure to commodity pricing. We recorded a $42 million lower of cost or market adjustment related to our inventory in 2014 driven by the lower price environment experienced in the second half of 2014. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $489 million, or 31%, to $2.1 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of higher throughput during 2014 driven by a full year of operations from the Los Angeles Acquisition partially offset by transportation cost savings from crude oil cargo sharing between our California and Anacortes refineries.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased $1.54 per barrel, or 14%, to $12.73 per barrel in 2014 as compared to 2013 given a stronger margin environment across all regions, refinery crude oil optimization and a marginal year-over-year increase in WTI to Brent crude oil discounts.

Total gross refining margin increased $942 million, or 33%, to $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013. Gross margins in the California, Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent regions increased $719 million, $52 million and $172 million, respectively. Gross refining margin increases in the California region were due to full year utilization of assets from the Los Angeles Acquisition and realization of synergies that improved margin capture. Margins increased in the Mid-Continent region due to additional throughput resulting from the expansion of the waxy crude project at our Utah refinery and the distillate desulfurization unit at our North Dakota refinery. The increase in the Pacific Northwest region was driven by stronger industry gasoline and diesel margins due to our ability to transport cost-advantaged Bakken crude oil, which continued to price at a discount to ANS during 2014, to our Washington refinery using TLLP’s Anacortes rail facility. 

2013 Compared to 2012

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment decreased $841 million to $873 million in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease is primarily due to lower gross refining margins driven by narrowing crude oil discounts relative to industry benchmarks during 2013 resulting in a reduction in feedstock advantages. Further operating income decreases were due to an increase in manufacturing costs mainly resulting from the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 as compared to 2012.

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 180 Mbpd, or 35%, to 697 Mbpd in 2013 as compared to 517 Mbpd in 2012. The increase is primarily a result of higher throughput in the California region due to the Los Angeles Acquisition. Throughput also increased at our North Dakota refinery during 2013 as a result of the refinery expansion completed in 2012 and from higher utilization rates at our Alaska and Martinez refineries in 2013 due to turnarounds in 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower throughput at our Washington and Utah refineries as a result of turnarounds in 2013.

Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $6.6 billion, or 23% to $35.0 billion in 2013 as compared to $28.3 billion in 2012, primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes as a result of the Los Angeles Acquisition, partially offset by lower average refined product sales prices. Total refined product sales increased by 181 Mbpd, or 29%, to 808 Mbpd in 2013 as compared to 627 Mbpd in 2012. Refined product sales volumes were impacted by an increase in refining and marketing integration driven by the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 and the transition of additional retail sites during 2012. Increases in sales volume were partially offset by a decrease in average sales price per barrel of $5.24 per barrel, or 4%, to $118.40 per barrel in 2013 as compared to $123.64 per barrel in 2012.

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales decreased by $1.30 per barrel, or 1%, to $109.64 per barrel in 2013 as compared to $110.94 per barrel in 2012, reflecting slightly lower crude oil prices as compared to 2012. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $415 million, or 36%, to $1.6 billion in 2013 due to higher throughput volumes at our Los Angeles refinery from the integration of assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition and at our Martinez refinery due to a large turnaround in the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we incurred higher repairs and maintenance expenses and natural gas costs, primarily at our California refineries.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel decreased by $5.92 per barrel, or 35%, to $11.19 per barrel in 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting weaker industry gasoline and diesel margins in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest markets and lower discounts on advantaged crude oil.

 55
Total gross refining margin decreased by $385 million, or 12%, to $2.8 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease is driven by lower industry margins during 2013. Gross refining margin in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest region decreased by $405 million and $321 million, respectively, and in the California region, increased by $338 million. The $338 million increase in gross refining margin at our California refineries was primarily attributable to additional throughput at our Los Angeles refinery and a turnaround at our Martinez refinery during 2012. Lower throughput at our Washington and Utah refineries during 2013 also contributed to the decrease in gross refining margin. We were able to transport cost-advantaged Bakken crude oil, which continued to price at a discount to Alaska North Slope crude oil during 2013 to our Washington refinery via TLLP’s Anacortes rail facility; however, these feedstock advantages were offset by lower gasoline and diesel margins in the region as compared to 2012.

TLLP Segment

TLLP is a publicly traded limited partnership that was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets. Its assets are integral to the success of Tesoro’s refining and marketing operations and generate revenue by charging fees for gathering crude oil and natural gas, for terminalling, transporting and storing crude oil and refined products and for processing and fractionating natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”). On December 2, 2014, TLLP completed the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition transforming TLLP into a full-service logistics company with assets allowing geographic and revenue diversification in support of our strategic initiatives. The results of operations for TLLP’s processing segment are shown in thousand barrels (“Mbbl”), per barrel, million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) and per MMBtu amounts.

Operational Data and Results. Management uses average revenue per barrel, revenue per gallon and average revenue per MMBtu to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. We calculate average revenue per barrel and gallon as revenue divided by total throughput and total processing volumes, respectively. We calculate average revenue per MMBtu as revenue divided by total volume. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income, revenues and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Our TLLP segment operating data are as follows:

2014 Compared to 2013 

Overview. Operating income for our TLLP segment increased $132 million to $206 million due to higher revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $85 million to $247 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 resulting from increased labor and operating costs associated with the acquired operations.

Revenues and Throughput. Terminalling and transportation throughput volumes increased during 2014 as compared to 2013 driven by a full year of operations following TLLP’s 2013 acquisitions of the Northwest Products System and the logistics assets that were part of our Los Angeles Acquisition. Pipeline gathering throughput volume also increased due to continued expansion of TLLP’s crude oil gathering assets and acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business. Total revenues increased $287 million to $600 million during 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher throughput volumes in terminalling and transportation from TLLP’s 2013 acquisitions. The Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition contributed $23 million in natural gas processing revenue in 2014.

Operating and Other Expenses. Increases in operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and depreciation expenses of $85 million, $42 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013 were driven by a full year of operations and depreciation following TLLP’s 2013 acquisitions of the Northwest Products System and the logistics assets that were part of our Los Angeles Acquisition. During 2014, TLLP incurred transaction and integration costs of $19 million related to its Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition. In addition, TLLP recorded an accrual during 2014 to reflect improved scope definition and estimates related to the 2013 release of crude oil in a rural field northeast of Tioga, North Dakota that exceeded TLLP’s insurance policy loss limit, which resulted in an increase in the total estimated cost associated with the project.

 57
2013 Compared to 2012 

Overview. Operating income for our TLLP segment increased by $17 million, to $74 million in 2013 from $57 million in 2012, due to an increase in revenues related to TLLP’s 2013 and 2012 acquisitions from Tesoro and the Northwest Products System Acquisition and higher throughput in gathering operations.

Revenues and Throughput. Revenues increased $149 million, or 91%, to $313 million in 2013 as compared to $164 million in 2012. This increase was driven by TLLP’s acquisitions of the Northwest Product System, the Los Angeles Logistics Assets, and the Los Angeles Terminal Assets in 2013, and the operation of the Anacortes rail facility acquired during 2012 for a full year. Increases in gathering and terminalling throughput were the result of the High Plains Pipeline reversal project and the acquisitions during 2013. TLLP also had higher volumes on the crude oil gathering assets, which resulted in an $18 million increase in revenue during 2013 as compared to 2012. 

Operating and Other Expenses. Operating expenses increased $87 million, or 116%, to $162 million in 2013 as compared to $75 million in 2012, primarily as a result of increased labor and operating costs associated with the operations of the Northwest Product System, the Los Angeles Logistics Assets, and the Los Angeles Terminal Assets acquired in 2013 and a full year of operations at the Anacortes Rail Facility, acquired in September 2012. Operating expenses also include the impact of TLLP Predecessors’ costs. TLLP also experienced higher costs in the crude oil gathering system associated with the higher throughput during 2013. Depreciation expense increased $30 million, or 200%, to $45 million in 2013 compared to $15 million in 2012 a result of the assets acquired in 2013. TLLP also incurred higher general and administrative expenses in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily as a result of increased overhead allocations and increased transaction and integration costs related to TLLP’s 2013 acquisitions.

Retail Segment

We sell gasoline and diesel fuel in the western United States through retail stations and agreements with third-party branded dealers and distributors (or “Jobber/dealers”). Our retail network provides a committed outlet for the majority of the gasoline produced by our refineries. During the fourth quarter 2014, we converted our company-operated retail locations to multi-site operators (“MSO”) retaining the transportation fuel sales. Under these MSO arrangements, we no longer operate the convenience stores, own the related merchandise inventory or employ the store employees as the MSO operates the stations. Our retail operating segment (“Retail”) included a network of 2,267 retail stations under the ARCO®, Shell®, Exxon®, Mobil®, USA GasolineTM and Tesoro® brands as of December 31, 2014. Effective May 1, 2014, we expanded our Exxon® and Mobil® branding rights to include Utah, Arizona, western Idaho and 4 counties in western Wisconsin. We acquired 15 additional retail stations in the Salt Lake City region in May 2014, which we have rebranded to the Exxon® brand.

Operational Data and Results. Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare fuel results to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel margin per gallon; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate fuel margin per gallon by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes. Investors and analysts may use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered an alternative to revenues, segment operating income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Fuel margin and fuel margin per gallon include the effect of intersegment purchases from the refining segment at prices which approximate market.

(b)In 2014, we converted our company-operated retail stations to MSO retail stations. The impact of this change was not material to our retail segment results.

2014 Compared to 2013

Overview. Operating income increased $304 million, or 253%, to $424 million in 2014, as compared to $120 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher total fuel sales volumes and higher fuel margin per gallon partially offset by higher operating expenses due to a larger retail network. Fuel sales revenues increased $2.4 billion, or 24%, to $12.5 billion in 2014 as compared to $10.1 billion in 2013, reflecting increased fuel sales volumes as a result of higher average station count in 2014 partially offset by lower average sales prices.

Gross Margin. Retail fuel margin per gallon increased 42% to $0.17 per gallon in 2014 primarily due to our ability to capture favorable market conditions where declining street prices were outpaced by spot market prices at the rack. Total gross margin increased $344 million, or 70% to $833 million in 2014 compared to $489 million in 2013, which was primarily driven by an increase in fuel sales volumes as well as the retail fuel margin. Fuel sales volumes increased 1.0 billion gallons, or 32%, to 4.2 billion gallons during 2014 as compared to 2013 reflecting higher average station count due to a full year of the stations added from the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 and continued expansion of our retail network during 2014.

Operating and Other Expenses. Operating expenses increased $34 million, or 11%, to $352 million during 2014 as compared to $318 million in 2013. The increase is a result of expenses incurred to operate additional stations from the expansion of our retail network.

 59
2013 Compared to 2012

Overview. Our retail segment operating income decreased $6 million, or 5% to $120 million in 2013 as compared to $126 million in 2012, primarily as a result of lower fuel margin per gallon and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher total fuel sales volumes. Retail fuel margin per gallon decreased 43% to $0.12 per gallon in 2013 primarily due to lower industry gasoline margins from the acquisition of additional dealer-operated sites in 2013 in connection with the Los Angeles Acquisition. The addition of these dealer-operated sites changed the ratio of dealer to company-operated sites, which impacted fuel margins in 2013. These dealer-operated sites generate lower fuel margin per gallon than our other retail sites. Fuel sale revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 71%, to $10.1 billion in 2013 as compared to $5.9 billion in 2012, reflecting higher average sales prices and increased fuel sales volumes as a result of higher average station count in 2013. 

Gross Margin. Gross margin increased $54 million, or 12%, to $489 million in 2013 compared to $435 million in 2012, which was primarily driven by higher fuel sales volumes. Fuel sales volumes increased 1.5 billion gallons, or 87%, to 3.2 billion gallons during 2013 as compared to 2012 reflecting higher average station count from the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 and transition of additional retail stations in the second half of 2012. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margin also increased to $99 million during 2013 compared to $74 million in 2012 due to the higher average station count.

Operating and Other Expenses. Operating expenses increased $66 million, or 26%, to $318 million during 2013 as compared to $252 million in 2012, primarily as a result of expenses incurred to operate additional stations acquired and transitioned during the second half of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013. Our other expenses remained relatively consistent compared to 2012.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 78 for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit agreements and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.

Capitalization

Our capital structure at December 31, 2014 was comprised of the following (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 60
At December 31, 2014, our debt to capitalization ratio increased to 38% as compared to 34% at December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the borrowings related to TLLP’s acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our debt to capitalization ratio, excluding TLLP, was 27% and 28%, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. TLLP’s total debt, including its capital leases, was $2.6 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The ratio also excludes noncontrolling interest of $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. TLLP’s debt is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we accomplished the following as discussed in further detail in Note 13 in Item 8 of our financial statements:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•TLLP completed an offer to exchange on July 25, 2014 the notes issued during the private offering of $250 million of the TLLP 2020 Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revolving Credit Facilities

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations with additional sources available under borrowing capacity from our revolving lines of credit and cash flows generated by TLLP’s acquisition of assets from us during 2014 and 2013. We ended 2014 with $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, no borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and $260 million of borrowings outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements. We had available capacity under revolving credit facilities as follows at December 31, 2014 (in millions):

(b)We can elect the interest rate to apply to the facility between a base rate plus the base rate margin, or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable term, plus the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing. The applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility varies primarily based upon our credit ratings. Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate.

(c)TLLP has the option to elect if the borrowings will bear interest at either, a base rate plus the base rate margin or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable period, plus the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing. The applicable margin varies based upon a certain leverage ratio, as defined by the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. TLLP incurs commitment fees for the unused portion of the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate.

Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility

On November 18, 2014, we entered into Omnibus Amendment No. 1 (the “Omnibus Amendment”) to the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Existing Credit Agreement”; and as amended in accordance with the Omnibus Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) dated as of January 4, 2013 and the related guaranties (the “Guaranties”). The Omnibus Amendment provided for:

•an extension of the revolving facility maturity date to November 18, 2019;

•total available revolving capacity of $3.0 billion, or lower based on the periodically adjusted borrowing base, and the removal of previously included required revolving loan commitment decreases;

•a reduction in the minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirement beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014;

•revisions to the covenants to provide additional flexibility for making restricted payments, dispositions and entering into certain investments; and

•a backstop guarantee by Tesoro of certain swap obligations.

The Amended Credit Agreement retains affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, other than as described above, continue to limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries and is guaranteed and secured to the same extent as the Existing Credit Agreement.

Overview. Our Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base, which consists of Tesoro’s eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories, net of the standard reserve as defined, or the Revolving Credit Facility’s total capacity of $3.0 billion. We had unused credit availability of approximately 80% of the eligible borrowing base at December 31, 2014. Our Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries, excluding TLGP, TLLP and its subsidiaries, and certain foreign subsidiaries, and is secured by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries’ crude oil and refined product inventories, cash and receivables.

Covenants. Our Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, senior notes and Term Loan Facility each limit our ability to make certain restricted payments (as defined in our debt agreements), which include dividends, purchases of our stock or voluntary prepayments of subordinate debt. The aggregate amount of restricted payments cannot exceed an amount defined in each of the debt agreements. The indentures for our senior notes also limit certain of our subsidiaries ability to make certain payments and distributions. These existing covenants and restrictions may limit, among other things, our ability to:

•pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase, redeem or retire our capital stock;

•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;

•make voluntary prepayments of subordinate debt;

•sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business;

•incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•engage in certain business activities;

•make certain payments and distributions from our subsidiaries;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

We do not believe that the limitations will restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock under our current programs. We have a default covenant that requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. There were no changes to the Revolving Credit Facility covenants during the year ended December 31, 2014, except as described above. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit agreements for foreign crude oil purchases. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the crude oil inventories for which they are issued. Capacity under these letter of credit agreements is available on an uncommitted basis and can be terminated by either party at any time.

TLLP Revolving Credit Facility

Overview. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility provided for total loan availability of $900 million as of December 31, 2014, and TLLP may request that the loan availability be increased up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP, and is guaranteed by all of TLLP’s subsidiaries, with the exception of certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries acquired in the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition, and secured by substantially all of TLLP’s assets. Borrowings are available under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility up to the total loan availability of the facility.

Covenants. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and TLLP senior notes contain certain covenants that may, among other things, limit or restrict TLLP’s ability (as well as those of TLLP’s subsidiaries) to:

•incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•pay and make certain restricted payments; 

•make distributions from its subsidiaries;

•dispose of assets in excess of an annual threshold amount;

•in the case of the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, make certain amendments, modifications or supplements to organization documents and material contracts;

•in the case of the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, engage in certain business activities;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into non-arm’s-length transactions with affiliates.

We do not believe that the limitations imposed by the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility will restrict TLLP’s ability to pay distributions. Additionally, the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that require TLLP to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. TLLP was in compliance with all TLLP Revolving Credit Facility covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Tesoro Debt

Term Loan Facility. We entered into the Term Loan Facility in January 2013, which allowed us to borrow up to an aggregate of $500 million, which we used to fund a portion of the Los Angeles Acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures May 30, 2016. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility are secured by all equity interests of Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC and Tesoro Alaska Company LLC, the Tesoro and USA Gasoline trademarks and those trademarks containing the name “ARCO” acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition, and junior liens on certain assets. The Term Loan Facility may be repaid at any time but amounts may not be re-borrowed. There were no payments on the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2014. The borrowings under our Term Loan Facility incurred interest at a rate of 2.42% as of December 31, 2014 based on the following expense and fee schedule:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________

(a)We can elect the interest rate to apply to the facility between a base rate plus the base rate margin, or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable term, plus the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing.

The Term Loan Facility contains affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default substantially similar to those set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility and contains negative covenants substantially similar to those set forth in most of our current indentures.

4.250% Senior Notes due 2017. We issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in September 2012, due October 2017.

The terms of the 2024 Notes are generally less restrictive than those contained in our senior notes due in 2017 and 2022, and exclude some limitations on restricted payments, asset sales and other transactions that are included in those senior notes. These notes are unsecured obligations and guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, excluding TLGP and TLLP and its subsidiaries.

TLLP Debt

TLLP 5.50% Senior Notes due 2019. TLLP completed the Senior Notes Offering pursuant to a private placement transaction conducted under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, effective October 29, 2014. The Senior Notes Offering consisted of $500 million of TLLP 2019 Notes. The proceeds from the TLLP 2019 Notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility related to its recent acquisition of logistics assets from Tesoro during the third quarter of 2014. The remaining net proceeds from the TLLP 2019 Notes and all of the net proceeds from the TLLP 2022 Notes (defined below) were used to fund the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition.

Share Repurchase Programs

We are authorized by our Board to purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions at our discretion. The Board’s authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases of our common stock can be made to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards and to meet our obligations under employee benefit and compensation plans, including the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and to fulfill other stock compensation requirements. We purchased approximately 8.4 million shares of our common stock in each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 for approximately $500 million and $436 million, respectively. On July 30, 2014, our Board approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which became effective upon the full completion of the current $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization during December 2014. With the new program, we have $1.0 billion remaining under our authorized programs, of which we have purchased approximately $19 million of additional shares through February 2015.

 65
Cash Dividends

We paid cash dividends totaling $141 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, based on a $0.30 per share and $0.25 per share quarterly cash dividend on common stock in the last half and first half of the year, respectively. We paid cash dividends totaling $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, based on a $0.25 per share quarterly cash dividend on common stock in the last half of the year and a $0.20 per share quarterly cash dividend on common stock in the first half of the year. We paid cash dividends totaling $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, based on a $0.15 per share quarterly cash dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter and a $0.12 per share quarterly cash dividend on common stock in the third quarter. We did not pay cash dividends during the first half of 2012. On February 5, 2015, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.425 per share, payable on March 13, 2015 to shareholders of record on February 27, 2015.

Cash Flow Summary

Working capital (excluding cash) decreased $72 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily related to the timing of receipts and payments and the decrease in inventories, including the $42 million lower of cost or market adjustment due to the lower price environment we experienced during the last quarter of 2014. Working capital (excluding cash) increased $564 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily related to the acquisition of $1.1 billion of inventories and other working capital in conjunction with the Los Angeles Acquisition. These amounts were offset by an increase in accounts payable as a result of increased purchases of feedstocks associated with the higher throughput in 2013, and a decrease in working capital of $277 million, related to the sale of the Hawaii Business.

Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2014 Compared to 2013

Net cash from operating activities increased $505 million, or 59%, to $1.4 billion in 2014, as compared to $859 million in 2013. The increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to $434 million in higher net earnings in 2014 when compared to 2013. There was also a $195 million decrease in deferred charges as a result of decreased turnaround and other deferred expenditure spending during 2014 compared to 2013.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $595 million, or 23% to $3.2 billion in 2014, as compared to $2.6 billion in 2013. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the receipt of gross proceeds of $539 million from the sale of the Hawaii Business in 2013. In addition, we had an increase in cash capital expenditures of $115 million. Cash paid for acquisitions during 2014, primarily the $2.5 billion acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business, was comparable to acquisitions in 2013, primarily the remaining $2.2 billion paid upon closing of the Los Angeles Acquisition in June 2013.

Net cash from financing activities during 2014 totaled $1.6 billion as compared to net cash from financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2013. Proceeds from financing activities during 2014 include the $500 million TLLP 2019 Notes, the $800 million TLLP 2022 Notes and the $300 million 2024 Notes using the net proceeds of $1.6 billion primarily to partially fund the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition and to repay the 2019 Notes. Borrowings on the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility were also used to partially fund the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition. Additional net proceeds of approximately $949 million from the issuance of TLLP common units were subsequently used by TLLP to fund the remaining portion of the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition and to repay a portion of the TLLP 2020 Notes. Additionally, purchases of common stock under our share repurchase programs increased $60 million and dividend payments and payments to noncontrolling interests increased $57 million during 2014 as compared to 2013.

 66
2013 Compared to 2012

Net cash from operating activities decreased $726 million, or 46%, to $859 million in 2013 as compared to $1.6 billion in 2012. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to lower earnings in 2013, partially offset by $81 million gain related to the sale of the Hawaii Business as compared to 2012. There was also a $174 million increase in deferred charges primarily as a result of increased turnaround spending of $105 million and the purchase of $63 million of emissions credits during 2013.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.9 billion, or 270% to $2.6 billion in 2013 as compared to $696 million in 2012. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the $2.2 billion payment upon closing of the Los Angeles Acquisition, TLLP’s $355 million acquisition of the Northwest Products System and increased cash capital expenditures of $41 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash during 2013 was the receipt of gross proceeds of $539 million from the sale of the Hawaii Business and advance payments made for acquisitions during 2012 of $130 million.

Net cash from financing activities during 2013 totaled $1.3 billion as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $150 million in 2012. Proceeds from financing activities during 2013 include $700 million and $544 million in proceeds from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and TLLP’s Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, and $500 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, all of which were used to fund the Los Angeles Acquisition during 2013. TLLP completed two private offerings of debt during August and December 2013, and used the net proceeds of $806 million primarily to repay borrowings outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and to partially fund the Los Angeles Logistics Assets acquisition. Additional net proceeds of approximately $702 million from the issuance of TLLP common units were subsequently used by TLLP to fund the acquisition of the Northwest Products System and the remainder of TLLP’s Los Angeles Logistics Assets acquisition. We used cash on hand to repay all of the borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and $102 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility in 2013. Additionally, purchases of common stock under our share repurchase programs increased $314 million during 2013 as compared to 2012.

Working capital (excluding cash) increased $564 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily related to the acquisition of $1.1 billion of inventories and other working capital in conjunction with the Los Angeles Acquisition. These amounts were offset by an increase in accounts payable as a result of increased purchases of feedstocks associated with the higher throughput in 2013, and a decrease in working capital of $277 million, related to the sale of the Hawaii Business.

Capital Expenditures

The cost estimates for capital expenditures, including environmental projects, described below are subject to further review and analysis and permitting requirements. Our capital spending plans include the following major projects (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)The cost estimates for capital expenditures exclude estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs.

(b)2014 actual capital expenditure disclosures include capitalized interest and labor costs associated with the project.

(c)The expansion project at the Utah refinery is designed to improve yields of gasoline and diesel, improve the flexibility of processing crude feedstocks and increase throughput capacity by 4 Mbpd. The expansion project will increase Waxy Crude oil processing up to 26 Mbpd. The first phase of this project was completed before 2014 and the second phase is expected to be completed in 2015. Our expected spending for phase two of this project was increased $60 million during the first quarter of 2014 due to revised cost estimates.

(d)TLLP is building and funding the construction of a pipeline gathering system (the “Connolly Gathering System”) to gather crude oil from various points in Dunn County, North Dakota for delivery at its existing Connolly Station with an expected capacity of approximately 60 Mbpd.

(e)The Clean Product Upgrade Project (formerly the Xylene Extraction Project) at our Anacortes, Washington refinery allows compliance with Tier 3 gasoline sulfur reduction; reduction of gasoline production costs; extraction of existing mixed xylene from gasoline and logistics capability for its export to manufacturers of polyester fibers and films used in clothing, food packaging and beverage containers. The project was approved by our board in February 2015 with approximately $30 million approved for the first phase of the project. The project remains subject to regulatory approval, which we expect to finalize in 2015. 

(f)The integration project at the Los Angeles refinery is designed to improve the flexibility of gasoline and diesel yields and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed project, subject to final board approval, project scoping, engineering and regulatory approval, includes decommissioning the fluid catalytic cracking unit at our Wilmington refinery. In previous periods, the estimated spend for this project was shown net of the anticipated capital spend on certain Wilmington assets subject to our integration plans that is no longer expected to be incurred. The amount presented above represents total capital spend expected during the integration of two facilities.

Our capital expenditures during 2014 were $779 million, including $244 million of TLLP capital spending. Our capital spending budget for 2015 of $600 million reflects the Company’s emphasis on long term strategic priorities including continued focus on safety and reliability and greater focus on value-driven growth. The 2015 capital budget excludes TLLP expected capital spending of $450 million, which is primarily financed by TLLP. Our 2015 budgeted and 2014 actual capital expenditure amounts, excluding TLLP capital spending, are comprised of the following project categories at December 31, 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Turnarounds and Other Deferred Expenditures

Our 2015 budget for refinery turnarounds, catalysts and other deferred expenditures is $345 million. Total expected spending for 2015 on turnarounds and catalysts is $280 million primarily at our Los Angeles, Anacortes and Martinez refineries. Refining throughput and yields in 2015 will be affected by these turnarounds. Our budget for 2015 also includes $65 million for other deferred expenditures. We spent $220 million for refinery turnarounds, catalysts and other deferred expenditures during 2014, including $196 million primarily for a turnaround and catalyst replacement at our California refineries.

 68
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements, other than our leasing arrangements described in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

Environmental and Other Matters

We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable third-party recoveries.

Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls or make other modifications to certain emission sources, equipment or facilities.

Future expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our refineries, tank farms, pipelines and currently and previously owned or operated terminal and retail station properties. The impact of these legislative and regulatory requirements, including any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program or low carbon fuel standards, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, or results of operations.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) proposed regulating greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions under the Clean Air Act in 2009. The first of these regulations, finalized in April 2010, set standards for the control of GHG emissions from light trucks and cars which could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels. In addition, the EPA has also finalized regulations to establish permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit GHG above a certain threshold. On October 15, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to the EPA’s GHG regulations but limited the argument to whether the EPA’s GHG regulations for vehicles necessarily trigger Clean Air Act permitting requirements for stationary sources. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the EPA’s regulatory authority but upheld portions of the EPA’s rulemaking that would regulate GHG emissions from permitted stationary sources. The stationary source permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries. We cannot currently predict the impact of these or other regulations on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

The Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating a second Renewable Fuels Standard (“RFS2”) requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 18.2 billion gallons in 2014 and to increase to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. However, the EPA has proposed, but has yet to finalize, a reduced total renewable fuel and advanced biofuel requirement of 15.2 billion gallons for 2014 and has yet to propose requirements for 2015. These requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture. In the near term, the RFS2 presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol, alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries. We are currently meeting the RFS2 requirements through a combination of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) that were carried over from prior periods, blending renewable fuels obtained from third parties and purchases of RINs in the open market. The spending related to the purchases of RINs for 2014 was not material to our operations and the spending for 2015 is not expected to be material based on our operations and the current regulatory environment. Actual costs related to RINs may differ due to changes in the market price of RINs and the ultimate destinations of our products. Additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels. While we cannot currently estimate the ultimate impact of this statute and implementing its regulations for future blending mandates, and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, the ultimate outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations.

 69
In California, Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions by requiring that the state return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and a low carbon fuel standard (“LCFS”), to achieve emissions reduction targets. The LCFS became effective in January 2010 and requires a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. In 2011, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approved cap-and-trade requirements that became effective in January 2013, and all of AB 32 related regulations are to be fully implemented by 2020. In December 2011, a U.S. District Court ruled that the LCFS violates the U.S. Constitution. CARB appealed the decision and, on September 18, 2013, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s decision and remanded the case to the lower court to rule on whether the ethanol provisions of the LCFS are unconstitutional. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the lower court’s ruling on the LCFS, and the implementation and implications of AB 32 will take many years to realize. On January 1, 2015, transportation fuels were brought into the California cap-and-trade program, making fuel suppliers responsible for carbon emission from their products. The cost for carbon emissions is being passed through to customers. We cannot currently predict the impact of the LCFS, cap and trade requirements, and other AB 32 related regulations on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Washington Refinery Fire. The naphtha hydrotreater unit at our Washington refinery was involved in a fire in April 2010, which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable. The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (“L&I”), the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (“CSB”) and the EPA initiated separate investigations of the incident. L&I completed its investigation in October 2010, issued citations and assessed a $2.4 million fine, which we appealed. L&I reassumed jurisdiction of the citation and affirmed the allegations in December 2010. We disagree with L&I’s characterizations of operations at our Washington refinery and believe, based on available evidence and scientific reviews, that many of the agency’s conclusions are mistaken. We filed an appeal of the citation in January 2011. In separate September 2013, November 2013 and February 2015 orders, the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals granted partial summary judgment in our favor and dismissed most of the citations. We have established an accrual for this matter although we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of its resolution. The outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

On May 1, 2014, the CSB finalized its investigation report on the April 2010 naphtha hydrotreater unit fire at our Washington refinery. In the report, the CSB made recommendations to federal and state agencies, the American Petroleum Industry and us. In response to the recommendations made to us, we have communicated to the CSB the actions we are and will be taking. Our completion of those actions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

On August 15, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) announced the closure of its investigation of the Washington naphtha hydrotreater fire. In the announcement, the DOJ, who conducted the investigation in conjunction with EPA, stated it declined to bring criminal charges.

We received a notice of violation (“NOV”) from the EPA alleging 46 violations of the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan requirements at our Washington refinery on November 20, 2013. The EPA conducted an investigation of the refinery in 2011, following the April 2010 fire in the naphtha hydrotreater unit. While we have submitted a response to the EPA and requested clarification of certain allegations, we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of this matter. We believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Environmental Liabilities. We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental remediation liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, we have recognized environmental remediation liabilities assumed in past acquisitions from the prior owners that include amounts estimated for site cleanup and monitoring activities arising from operations at refineries, certain terminals and pipelines, and retail stations prior to the dates of our acquisitions. Our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments, and it is possible that our projections will change and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available. Changes in our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________________[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our environmental liabilities include $216 million as of both December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to amounts estimated for site cleanup activities arising from operations at our Martinez refinery and operations of assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition prior to their respective acquisition dates. We cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the Martinez refinery and for assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition, and it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and remediation costs for site cleanup activities as more information becomes available. The environmental remediation liabilities assumed in the Los Angeles Acquisition include amounts estimated for site cleanup activities and monitoring activities arising from operations at the Carson refinery, certain terminals and pipelines, and retail stations prior to our acquisition on June 1, 2013. These estimates for environmental liabilities are based on third-party assessments and available information. Our estimates for site cleanup activities reflect amounts for which we are responsible under applicable cost-sharing arrangements. We also have insurance policies related to certain matters at our Martinez refinery that provide coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of $50 million in self-insurance. We have not recognized possible insurance recoveries and the insurer has challenged coverage and filed a declaratory relief action in federal court.

In September 2013, TLLP responded to the release of crude oil in a rural field northeast of Tioga, North Dakota (the “Crude Oil Pipeline Release”). The environmental liabilities related to the Crude Oil Pipeline Release include amounts estimated for remediation activities that will be conducted during the next few years to restore the site for agricultural use. As of December 31, 2013, TLLP had accrued $14 million of environmental liabilities for remediation costs. TLLP accrued an additional $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to reflect improved scope definition and estimates which resulted in an increase in the total estimated cost associated with the project. The estimated remediation costs exceeded TLLP’s pollution liability insurance policy, which is subject to a $1 million deductible and a $25 million loss limit, by $17 million as of December 31, 2014. TLLP had insurance recovery receivables of $18 million and $14 million related to the Crude Oil Pipeline Release at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Through December 31, 2014, TLLP has received insurance proceeds of $7 million in reimbursement of costs incurred.

Other Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have not established accruals for these matters unless a loss is probable, and the amount of loss is currently estimable.

Environmental. The EPA has alleged that we have violated certain Clean Air Act regulations at our Alaska, Washington, Martinez, North Dakota and Utah refineries. We also retained the responsibility for resolving similar allegations relating to our former Hawaii refinery, which we sold in September 2013. Refer to Note 4 for a discussion of the amounts recognized in 2014 related to the resolution of this matter at the Hawaii refinery. We previously received a NOV in March 2011 from the EPA alleging violations of Title V of the Clean Air Act at our Alaska refinery, which arose from a 2007 state of Alaska inspection and inspections by the EPA in 2008 and 2010. We also previously received NOVs in 2005 and 2008 alleging violations of the Clean Air Act at our Washington refinery. We are continuing discussions of all EPA claims with the EPA and the DOJ. We have established an accrual for this matter although we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of its resolution. The ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material impact on our future interim or annual results of operations, as we may be required to incur material capital expenditures at our operating refineries. However, we do not believe that the final outcome of this matter will have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position.

We have investigated conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Martinez refinery pursuant to an order received in 2004 from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board that named us as well as two previous owners of the Martinez refinery. We cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order, but we believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Certain non-governmental organizations filed a Request for Agency Action (the “Request”) with the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) concerning our Utah refinery in October 2012. The Request challenges the UDEQ’s permitting of our refinery conversion project alleging that the permits do not conform to the requirements of the Clean Air Act. As the permittee, we are the real party in interest and will be defending the permits with UDEQ. In orders issued on July 10 and September 9, 2014, the UDEQ Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) recommended the Executive Director of UDEQ deny Petitioners’ request for a stay of the project and dismiss their challenge to the permit. The Executive Director’s final decision approving the ALJ’s recommended order is currently under appeal. While we cannot estimate the timing or estimated amount, if any, associated with the outcome of this matter, we do not believe it will have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

 71
The CSB is investigating February and March 2014 incidents at our Martinez refinery involving sulfuric acid exposure at the Alkylation Unit. The California Department of Industrial Relations (“Cal-OSHA”) along with Contra Costa County Health District (“CCCHD”) also started investigations of the incidents. In addition, the EPA is conducting an investigation to evaluate the Martinez refinery’s compliance with certain federal environmental acts and the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act. While we cannot currently predict the timing and the resolution of these investigations, we believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

In August 2014, we received citations from Cal-OSHA alleging violations of the California Labor Code associated with the two incidents at our Martinez refinery in February and March 2014. We are working with Cal-OSHA to mitigate and resolve the allegations. While we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of this matter, the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Tax. We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result in increased expenditures in the future. Congress and the administration continue to explore options for reform of the domestic corporate tax code. Several of these options, if enacted into law, could have a significant impact on our tax liability. We are also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities. However, we believe that resolution of any such claim(s) would not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by as much as $8 million in the next twelve months, related primarily to state apportionment matters. However, since the tax was fully paid in prior years, the unrecognized tax benefit would be eliminated without impacting expense.

Long-Term Commitments

We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes 13 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to TLLP under our various fee-based commercial agreements as these related-party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2014 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________________

(a)Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings. Interest payments assume the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2014.

(b)Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)Represents long-term commitments primarily for the transportation of crude oil, refined products and NGLs as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contract’s minimum volume requirements.

(e)Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.

 72
We also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Note 15 and Note 16, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits, with the exception of amounts classified as current, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded from the table $4 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, and also excluded from the table, is a liability for potential interest and penalties of $1 million at December 31, 2014. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Pension Funding

We provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees, with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 6.50% as of December 31, 2014, and the actual return on our funded employee pension plan assets was $37 million, or 8.9%, in 2014 and $15 million, or 4.0%, in 2013. Based on a 4.05% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2014, the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 60% of the projected benefit obligation. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”) was signed into law in July 2012, which includes provisions for pension funding relief for plan sponsors by stabilizing the interest rates used to determine their pension funding requirements. Previous funding rules required using a discount rate based on a two-year average of high quality corporate bond rates to determine pension liabilities and minimum contributions. The new legislation stipulates that the discount rate must remain within a specified corridor of a 25-year average corporate bond rate, with such corridor widening from 10% to 30% between 2012 and 2016. The provisions of MAP-21 were effective for plan years beginning on or after January 2012. On this new MAP-21 basis, at January 1, 2014 the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations) was 109%. Although our funded employee retirement plan fully meets all of the funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we contributed $60 million during 2014 to improve the plan’s funded status. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, discount rates, employee demographics, regulatory environments and other factors. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles. We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental requirements could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. 

We evaluate these assets for potential impairment when an asset disposition is probable or when there are indicators of impairment (for example, current period operating losses combined with a history of operating losses or a temporary shutdown of a refinery) and, if so, assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset’s net book value exceeds its fair market value. Fair market value is based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. At December 31, 2012, we evaluated our Hawaii refinery for potential impairment. See Notes 4 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from the analysis.

 73
Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. We must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $8 million on certain state tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2014, based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. We may need to establish an additional valuation allowance if actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods. 

We also recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that are not recognized that we have taken or expect to take are generally recorded as liabilities. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties totaled $5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status or a liability if the plans are underfunded. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligations. While we believe the assumptions we used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to the effective yields on high quality corporate bonds that have a comparable cash flow pattern to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans and also uses a three-year average of the market value of plan assets. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the funded qualified employee retirement plan would increase (decrease) net periodic expense in 2014 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.

Environmental Liabilities. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, our total environmental liabilities included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities were $274 million and $262 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Usually, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties.

Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. We do not discount our estimated liabilities to present value.

 74
Acquisitions. We use the acquisition method of accounting for the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with acquisitions at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, we obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based Compensation.  We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and certain other stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions including the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term, and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as outlined above; however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and impact of the possible differing stock price paths. Changes in our assumptions, including forfeiture and volatility estimates, may impact the expenses related to our stock-based awards. The fair values of our stock appreciation rights, phantom stock options, and performance share awards based on market conditions are remeasured at the end of each reporting period and are recorded as other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

New Accounting Standards and Disclosures

Revenue Recognition. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) in May 2014 providing accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The requirements from the new ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. At this time, we are evaluating the guidance to determine the method of adoption and the impact of this ASU on our financial statements and related disclosures.

Consolidation. The FASB issued an ASU in February 2015 amending current consolidation guidance including changes to both the variable and voting interest models used by companies to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. The requirements from the new ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the new ASU to determine whether any of our current conclusions with respect to consolidation of variable interest or other entities will change under the new guidance. At this time, we cannot estimate the impact of this ASU on our financial statements and related disclosures.
