A total of 26 franchised stores were operating at January 29, 2011. Royalty income from the franchised stores was not significant for any of the periods presented. These stores are not included in the Companys operating store count above.  

Overview of Consolidated Results  

The Company recorded net income from continuing operations of $169 million or $1.07 per diluted share for 2010; this compares with $47 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the prior-year period. Other highlights include:  

   Sales increased by 4.0 percent and comparable-store sales increased by 5.8 percent as compared with the corresponding prior-year period.    

   Gross margin increased 260 basis points in 2010 as compared with 2009. Included in cost of sales for 2009 is a $14 million charge to reserve for inventory as the Company began its transition to a new apparel strategy.    

   The Company recorded a charge of $10 million in 2010 to impair the CCS tradename intangible asset due to the lower projected revenues for this division. Included in 2009 are impairment charges totaling $36 million, of which $32 million was recorded to impair store long-lived assets within the Athletic Stores segment and $4 million related to a write-off of certain software development costs within the Direct-to-Customers segment.    

   The Company recorded a $2 million gain in 2010 on the settlement on its money-market investment in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. (the Fund). During 2008, the Company had recognized an impairment loss of $3 million representing the decreased value of the underlying securities of Lehman Brothers held in the Fund. These amounts were recorded with no tax expense or benefit.     

14 

Other highlights include:  

   Cash and cash equivalents at January 29, 2011 were $696 million, representing an increase of $114 million.    

   Cash flow provided from operations was $326 million, which included the payment on the settlement of the net investment hedge of $24 million and qualified pension contribution totaling $32 million. The funded status of the qualified plans improved to 93 percent as compared with 87 percent in 2009.

   Sales of $6 billion    

   Sales per gross square foot of $400    

   EBIT margin of 8 percent    

   Net income margin of 5 percent    

   Return on Invested Capital of 10 percent    

In the following tables, the Company has presented certain financial measures and ratios identified as non-GAAP. The Company believes this non-GAAP information is a useful measure to investors because it allows for a more direct comparison of the Companys performance for 2010 as compared with 2009 and is useful in assessing the Companys progress in achieving its long-term financial objectives noted above. The following represents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures:

Reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, continued: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

When assessing Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), the Company adjusts its results to reflect its operating leases as if they qualified for capital lease treatment. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the presentation of these leases as capital leases is appropriate. Accordingly, the asset base and net income amounts in the calculation of ROIC are adjusted to reflect this. ROIC, subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long-term incentive compensation. The closest GAAP measure is Return on Assets (ROA) and is also represented below. ROA increased to 5.9 percent as compared with 1.7 percent in the prior year reflecting the Companys overall strong performance in 2010.

The following table represents a summary of sales and operating results, reconciled to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) The year ended January 30, 2010 includes non-cash impairment charges totaling $32 million, which were recorded to write-down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements at the Companys Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions. The year ended January 31, 2009 includes a $241 million charge representing long-lived store asset impairment, goodwill and other intangibles impairment, and store closing costs related to the Companys U.S. operations.    

  (2) Included in the results for the year ended January 29, 2011 is a non-cash impairment charge of $10 million to write-down the CCS tradename intangible asset. Included in the results for the year ended January 30, 2010 is a non-cash impairment charge of $4 million to write off software development costs.    

  (3) During the year ended January 30, 2010, the Company adjusted its 1999 restructuring reserves to reflect a favorable lease termination.    

  (4) During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company restructured its organization by consolidating the Lady Foot Locker, Foot Locker U.S., Kids Foot Locker, and Footaction businesses in addition to reducing corporate staff, resulting in a $5 million charge. Included in corporate expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 is a $3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to the investment in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund. Additionally, for the year ended January 31, 2009 the Company recorded a $15 million impairment charge on the Northern Group note receivable.    

  (5) Other income includes non-operating items, such as gains from insurance recoveries, gains on the repurchase and retirement of bonds, royalty income, the changes in fair value, premiums paid and realized gains associated with foreign currency option contracts. Included in the year ended January 29, 2011 is a $2 million gain to reflect the Companys settlement of its investment in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund.    

Sales  

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales from stores that are open at the period-end, that have been open for more than one year, and exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, stores opened and closed during the period are not included. Sales from the Direct-to-Customers segment are included in the calculation of comparable-store sales for all periods presented. Sales from acquired businesses that include the purchase of inventory are included in the computation of comparable-store sales after 15 months of operations. Accordingly, effective with the first quarter of 2010, CCS internet and catalog sales have been included in the computation of comparable-store sales.  

Sales increased to $5,049 million, or by 4.0 percent as compared with 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased 4.6 percent as compared with 2009. Comparable-store sales increased by 5.8 percent.  

Sales of $4,854 million in 2009 decreased by 7.3 percent from sales of $5,237 million in 2008. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales declined 6.1 percent as compared with 2008. Comparable-store sales decreased by 6.3 percent.   

17 

Gross Margin  

Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 30.0 percent in 2010 increasing 260 basis points as compared with 2009. In 2009, the Company recorded a $14 million inventory reserve on certain aged apparel as part of its new apparel strategy. Excluding this charge, gross margin would have increased by 230 basis points as compared with 2009. This increase reflected an increase of 150 basis points in the merchandise margin rate reflecting lower markdowns as the Company was less promotional during the year as compared with the prior year. Lower vendor allowances during the current year, reflecting the overall lower promotional activity, negatively affected gross margin by 10 basis points. The increase in the gross margin also reflected a decrease of 80 basis points in the occupancy and buyers salary expense rate reflecting improved leverage and expense reductions.  

Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 27.4 percent in 2009 decreasing 50 basis points as compared with 2008. The decrease in the gross margin reflected an increase of 30 basis points in the merchandise margin rate due to lower markdowns, offset by an 80 basis point increase in the occupancy rate due to lower sales. Vendor allowances were essentially the same as compared with 2008 and did not significantly affect the gross margin rate. Excluding the $14 million inventory reserve recorded in 2009, gross margin would have declined by 20 basis points as compared with 2008.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $39 million to $1,138 million in 2010, or by 3.5 percent, as compared with 2009. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.5 percent as compared with 22.6 percent in 2009, due to expense management and the increase in sales. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, SG&A increased by $47 million. This increase primarily reflects higher incentive compensation costs totaling $45 million, partially offset by expense management efforts.  

SG&A expenses decreased by $75 million to $1,099 million in 2009, or by 6.4 percent, as compared with 2008. SG&A as a percentage of sales increased to 22.6 percent as compared with 22.4 percent in 2008, due to the decline in sales. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations in 2009, SG&A decreased by $64 million. This decrease reflects lower divisional expenses primarily due to operating fewer stores and compensation expense, offset, in part, by increased pension expense of $13 million.  

Corporate Expense  

Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Companys corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items.  

Corporate expense increased by $30 million to $97 million in 2010 as compared with 2009. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $12 million in 2010 and $13 million in 2009. Incentive compensation costs included within corporate expense represent an increase of $29 million as a result of the Companys outperformance as compared with plan. Additionally, 2009 included a $5 million charge related to the reorganization of its operations and corporate staff reductions.  

Corporate expense decreased by $20 million to $67 million in 2009 as compared with 2008. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $13 million in both 2009 and 2008. Included in 2008 corporate expense were charges that totaled $18 million, which represented a $3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to a short-term investment and a $15 million impairment charge related to the Northern Group note receivable. The balance of the change represents lower incentive compensation costs as well as income of $3 million related to the final settlement of the Visa/MasterCard litigation. These reductions in corporate expense were offset, in part, by higher pension expense.  

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization of $106 million decreased by 5.4 percent in 2010 from $112 million in 2009. This decrease primarily reflects reduced depreciation and amortization resulting from store long-lived asset impairment charges recorded in 2009. Additionally, foreign currency fluctuations reduced depreciation and amortization expense by $1 million.   

18 

Depreciation and amortization of $112 million decreased by 13.8 percent in 2009 from $130 million in 2008. This decrease primarily reflects the effect of the impairment charges offset, in part, by increased depreciation and amortization related to the Companys capital spending, as well as the amortization expense associated with the CCS customer list intangible. The effect of foreign currency fluctuations was not significant.  

Interest Expense, Net  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense of $14 million increased by $1 million as compared with 2009. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to higher fees associated with the revolving credit facility. Interest expense in 2010 includes $1 million in amortization of the gain realized from the termination of the interest rate swap. The Company did not have any short-term borrowings for any of the periods presented. Interest income of $5 million increased from $3 million in 2009 primarily reflecting income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances.  

Interest expense of $13 million in 2009 decreased by $3 million as compared with 2008. The decrease in interest expense primarily relates to the termination of the cross currency swaps, which represented expense of $3 million in 2008, as well as lower average debt outstanding during 2009. Interest expense in 2009 was also reduced by $1 million, reflecting the effect of the amortization of the gain realized from the termination of the interest rate swap. This was offset, in part, by higher fees associated with the revolving credit facility. Interest income of $3 million in 2009 declined from $11 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates received on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  

Other Income  

Other income was $4 million, $3 million, and $8 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. For 2010, other income includes a $2 million gain to reflect the settlement of the Reserve International Liquidity Fund money-market investment, as well as royalty income from the Companys franchising agreements and gains on lease terminations related to certain lease interests in Europe. For 2009, other income includes $4 million related to gains from insurance recoveries, gains on the purchase and retirement of bonds, and royalty income partially offset by foreign currency option contract premiums of $1 million. Other income in 2008 primarily reflects a $4 million net gain related to the Companys foreign currency options contracts and a $3 million gain on lease terminations related to two lease interests in Europe.  

Income Taxes  

The effective tax rate for 2010 was 34.3 percent, as compared with 36.0 percent in 2009. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a benefit of $7 million from a favorable tax settlement. This benefit was offset in part by a $4 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter to correct a historical error in the calculation of income taxes on amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss pertaining to the Companys Canadian pension plans. The Company determined that this amount was not material to any previously issued financial statements or to the current period; accordingly it was corrected in 2010. Additionally, the 2009 effective rate included Canadian provincial tax rate changes that resulted in a $4 million expense arising from a reduction in the value of the Companys net deferred tax assets. Excluding these items, the effective rate increased as compared with the prior year reflecting a higher proportion of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions.  

The effective tax rate for 2009 was an expense of 36.0 percent, as compared with a benefit of 20.8 percent in 2008. The effective tax rate changed primarily due to impairment charges in 2008, which created an overall book loss, coupled with the effect of an impairment of goodwill, a portion of which was not deductible for tax purposes, as well as 2009 Canadian provincial tax rate changes that resulted in a $4 million charge for reduction in the value of the Companys net deferred tax assets.

Segment Information  

The Companys two reportable segments, Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers, are based on its method of internal reporting. The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, the primary financial measure of which is division results. Division profit (loss) reflects income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense. Sales and division results for the Companys reportable segments for the years ended January 29, 2011, January 30, 2010, and January 31, 2009 are presented below.  

Athletic Stores  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2010 compared with 2009  

Athletic Stores sales of $4,617 million increased 3.8 percent in 2010, as compared with $4,448 million in 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, primarily related to the euro, sales from the Athletic Stores segment increased by 4.4 percent in 2010. Comparable-store sales for the Athletic Stores segment increased 5.7 percent as compared with the prior year. The Companys U.S. operations sales increased 3.9 percent reflecting meaningful increases in all formats, except for Lady Foot Locker. Lady Foot Locker was negatively affected by the lower demand for certain styles, in particular toning. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, international sales increased 5.5 percent in 2010 as compared with 2009. Foot Locker Europes sales reflected strong increases in mens footwear and apparel.  

Athletic Stores reported a division profit of $329 million in 2010 as compared with $114 million in 2009. The 2009 results included impairment charges totaling $32 million, which were recorded to write down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements at the Companys Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions for 787 stores. Additionally, in 2009 the Company recorded a $14 million inventory reserve on certain aged apparel. Excluding these charges, division profit increased by $169 million as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. This increase reflects division profit gains in both the Companys domestic and international operations. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively affected division profit by approximately $4 million as compared with the corresponding prior-year period.  

2009 compared with 2008  

Athletic Stores sales of $4,448 million decreased 8.2 percent in 2009, as compared with $4,847 million in 2008. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, primarily related to the euro, sales from the Athletic Stores segment decreased by 7.0 percent in 2009. Comparable-store sales for the Athletic Stores segment declined 6.2 percent as compared with 2008. The decline in sales for the year ended January 30, 2010 was primarily related to the domestic operations as the result of a decline in mall traffic and consumer spending in general. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales in Europe increased low single digits in 2009 as compared with 2008.   

20 

Athletic Stores reported a division profit of $114 million in 2009 as compared with a loss of $59 million in 2008. Included in the results are impairment and other charges of $46 million and $241 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 results included impairment charges totaling $32 million and a $14 million inventory reserve on certain aged apparel. The 2008 results included a $241 million charge representing long-lived store asset impairment, goodwill and other intangibles impairment, and store closing costs related to the Companys U.S. operations. Excluding these charges, division profit decreased $22 million in 2009 as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, which relates primarily to the domestic businesses. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, division profit of international operations was essentially flat as compared with the corresponding prior-year period.  

Direct-to-Customers  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2010 compared with 2009  

Direct-to-Customers sales increased 6.4 percent to $432 million in 2010, as compared with $406 million in 2009. Effective with the first quarter of 2010, CCS internet and catalog sales have been included in the computation of comparable-store sales. Internet sales increased by 9.0 percent to $375 million, as compared with 2009 reflecting a strong sales performance through the Companys store banner websites, which benefited from improved functionality and more compelling product assortments. Catalog sales decreased by 8.1 percent to $57 million in 2010 from $62 million in 2009. Management believes that the decrease in catalog sales is the result of the continuing trend of customers browsing and selecting products through its catalogs and then making their purchases via the Internet.  

The Direct-to-Customers business generated division profit of $30 million in 2010, as compared with $32 million in 2009. Division profit, as a percentage of sales, was 6.9 percent in 2010 and 7.9 percent in 2009. Included in the 2010 division profit is a $10 million impairment charge, which was recorded to write down CCS intangible assets, specifically the non-amortizing tradename. The impairment was primarily the result of reduced revenue projections. Included in 2009 division profit is a $4 million impairment charge, which was recorded to write off certain software development costs as a result of managements decision to terminate the project. Excluding these charges, division profit increased by $4 million as compared with the prior year.  

2009 compared with 2008  

Direct-to-Customers sales increased 4.1 percent to $406 million in 2009, as compared with $390 million in 2008, reflecting a comparable-store sales decrease of 6.8 percent, offset by additional sales from CCS, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2008. Internet sales increased by 6.8 percent to $344 million, as compared with 2008 reflecting continued growth in the store brands websites. Catalog sales decreased by 8.8 percent to $62 million in 2009 from $68 million in 2008.  

The Direct-to-Customers business generated division profit of $32 million in 2009, as compared with $43 million in 2008. Division profit, as a percentage of sales, was 7.9 percent in 2009 and 11.0 percent in 2008. Included in division profit is a $4 million impairment charge, which was recorded to write off certain software development costs as a result of managements decision to terminate the project. Gross margin was negatively affected by the lack of close-out inventory purchases during the year. Additionally, division profit, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, was negatively affected by $3 million in additional amortization expense related to the CCS customer list intangible asset.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity  

The Companys primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to: fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of its short-term and long-term operating strategies. The Company generally finances real estate with operating leases.  

Management believes its cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and the Companys current revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund these requirements. The Company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces or customer acceptance of the Companys merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, the Companys reliance on a few key vendors for a significant portion of its merchandise purchases, and risks associated with foreign global sourcing or economic conditions worldwide could affect the ability of the Company to continue to fund its needs from business operations.  

Maintaining access to merchandise that the Company considers appropriate for its business may be subject to the policies and practices of its key vendors. Therefore, the Company believes that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with its key vendors. In 2010 and 2009, the Company purchased approximately 82 percent of its merchandise from its top five vendors and expects to continue to obtain a significant percentage of its athletic product from these vendors in future periods. Approximately 63 percent in 2010 and 68 percent in 2009 was purchased from one vendor  Nike, Inc.  

Planned capital expenditures for 2011 are approximately $153 million, of which $116 million relates to modernizations of existing stores and the planned opening of 60 new stores, and $37 million is allocated for the development of information systems and other support facilities. In addition, planned lease acquisition costs related to the Companys operations in Europe are $7 million. The Company has the ability to revise and reschedule much of the anticipated capital expenditure program, should the Companys financial position require it.  

Cash Flow  

Operating activities from continuing operations provided cash of $326 million in 2010 as compared with $346 million in 2009. These amounts reflect income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Non-cash impairment and other charges were $10 million and $36 million for the years ending January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. The Company recorded a $10 million impairment charge in 2010 related to its CCS tradename. The 2009 charges totaled $36 million, comprised of $32 million to write-down long-lived assets such as store fixtures and leasehold improvements at the Companys Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Footaction, and Champs Sports divisions and $4 million to write off software development costs. During 2010, the Company contributed $32 million to its U.S. and Canadian qualified pension plans as compared with $100 million contributed in 2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the change in accounts payable, as compared with the prior-year period, represents inventory required to support the favorable sales trend. During 2010, the Company paid $24 million to settle the liability associated with the terminated European net investment hedge, whereas in the prior-year period the Company terminated its interest rate swaps and received $19 million.   

22 

Operating activities from continuing operations provided cash of $346 million in 2009 as compared with $383 million in 2008. These amounts reflect income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. During 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment and other charges of $36 million primarily related to impairment of store-level assets in the domestic operations. Merchandise inventories represented a $111 million source of cash in 2009 as inventory purchases were reduced to keep inventory levels in line with sales as well as reflecting the effect of the store closings. During 2009, the Company contributed $100 million to its U.S. and Canadian qualified pension plans as compared with $6 million contributed in 2008. Additionally, during 2009 the Company terminated its interest rate swaps for a gain of $19 million. The other changes primarily reflect the timing of February 2010 rent payments, which totaled $34 million and were due and paid in 2010 as compared with the February 2009 rent payments that were due and paid in 2008, as well as income tax refunds of $32 million.  

Net cash used in investing activities of the Companys continuing operations was $87 million in 2010 as compared with $72 million used in investing activities in 2009. During 2010, the Company received $9 million from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund representing further redemptions. Capital expenditures were $97 million primarily related to store remodeling and to the development of information systems and other support facilities, representing an increase of $8 million as compared with the prior year.  

Net cash used in investing activities of the Companys continuing operations was $72 million in 2009 as compared with $272 million used in investing activities in 2008. During 2009, the Company received $16 million from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund representing further redemptions. Capital expenditures were $89 million, primarily related to store remodeling and to the development of information systems and other support facilities, representing a decrease of $57 million as compared with the prior year. The Company made a strategic decision to conserve cash in 2009 and, therefore, reduced capital spending, focusing on projects that improved the customer experience. The net cash used in investing activities in 2008 reflected the acquisition of CCS for $106 million.  

Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $127 million in 2010 as compared with $94 million in 2009. During 2010, the Company repurchased 3,215,000 shares of its common stock under its common share repurchase program for $50 million. Additionally, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $93 million and $94 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing a quarterly rate of $0.15 per share in both 2010 and 2009. On February 15, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Companys common stock of $0.165 per share, which represents an increase of 10 percent. During 2010 and 2009, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $10 million and $3 million, respectively. During 2010, in connection with stock option exercises, the Company recorded excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $3 million as a financing activity.  

Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $94 million in 2009 as compared with $185 million in 2008. During 2009 and 2008, the Company purchased and retired $3 million and $6 million, respectively, of its 8.50 percent debentures. During 2008, the Company reduced its long-term debt by repaying the balance of its term loan of $88 million. Additionally, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $94 million and $93 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing a quarterly rate of $0.15 per share in both 2009 and 2008. During 2009 and 2008, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $3 million and $2 million, respectively.

Capital Structure  

Credit Agreement  

On March 20, 2009, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the 2009 Credit Agreement) with its banks, providing for a $200 million asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on March 20, 2013. The 2009 Credit Agreement also provides for an incremental facility of up to $100 million under certain circumstances. The 2009 Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of the Companys domestic assets, including certain inventory assets. The Company is not required to comply with any financial covenants as long as there are no outstanding borrowings. If the Company is borrowing, then it may not make Restricted Payments, such as dividends or share repurchases, unless there is at least $50 million of Excess Availability (as defined in the 2009 Credit Agreement), and the Companys projected fixed charge coverage ratio, which is a Non-GAAP financial ratio determined pursuant to the 2009 Credit Agreement designed as a measure of the Companys ability to meet current and future obligations (Consolidated EBITDA less capital expenditures less cash taxes divided by Debt Service Charges and Restricted Payments), is at least 1.1 to 1.0. The Companys management does not currently expect to borrow under the facility in 2011.  

Credit Rating  

As of March 28, 2011, the Companys corporate credit ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Service are BB- and Ba3, respectively. Additionally, Moodys Investors Service has rated the Companys senior unsecured notes B1.  

Debt Capitalization and Equity  

For purposes of calculating debt to total capitalization, the Company includes the present value of operating lease commitments in total net debt. Total net debt including the present value of operating leases is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The present value of operating leases is discounted using various interest rates ranging from 4 percent to 15 percent, which represent the Companys incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believe that the inclusion of the present value of operating leases in total debt is useful to our investors, credit constituencies, and rating agencies.  

The following table sets forth the components of the Companys capitalization, both with and without the present value of operating leases:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company increased cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments by $107 million during 2010 reflecting strong cash flow generation from operating activities. Additionally, the present value of the operating leases decreased by $71 million as compared with the prior year. This decrease represents the effect of the store closures, offset, in part, by lease renewals and the effect of foreign currency translation. Including the present value of operating leases, the Companys net debt capitalization percent decreased 400 basis points in 2010.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following tables represent the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at January 29, 2011:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) The amounts presented above represent the contractual maturities of the Companys long-term debt, including interest; however it excludes the unamortized gain of the interest rate swap of $17 million. Additional information is included in the Long-Term Debt note under Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.    

  (2) The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance, and other costs. These costs have historically represented approximately 25 to 30 percent of the minimum rent amount. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are unknown.    

  (3) The Companys other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 29, 2011 primarily comprise pension and postretirement benefits, deferred rent liability, income taxes, workers compensation and general liability reserves, and various other accruals. The amount presented in the table represents the Companys 2011 Canadian qualified plan contributions of $1 million. Other than this liability, other amounts (including the Companys unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million) have been excluded from the above table as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain. The timing of the remaining amounts that are known has not been included as they are minimal and not useful to the presentation. Additional information is included in the Other Liabilities, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, and Retirement Plans and Other Benefits notes under Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (4) Represents the unused domestic lines of credit pursuant to the Companys $200 million revolving credit agreement. The Companys management currently does not expect to borrow under the facility in 2011.    

  (5) Represents open purchase orders, as well as other commitments for merchandise purchases, at January 29, 2011. The Company is obligated under the terms of purchase orders; however, the Company is generally able to renegotiate the timing and quantity of these orders with certain vendors in response to shifts in consumer preferences.    

  (6) Represents payments required by non-merchandise purchase agreements.    

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business as disclosed above, or unconsolidated special purpose entities. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities. The Companys policy prohibits the use of derivatives for which there is no underlying exposure.  

In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, the Company may be obligated for certain lease commitments transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot be readily determined, management believes that the resolution of such contingencies will not significantly affect the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. The Company is also operating certain stores for which lease agreements are in the process of being negotiated with landlords. Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that leases will be executed.

Critical Accounting Policies  

Managements responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the Companys financial statements requires diligent application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, the Companys accounting policies and methods are those specifically required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data is a summary of the Companys most significant accounting policies. In some cases, management is required to calculate amounts based on estimates for matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company believes the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments.  

Merchandise Inventories  

Merchandise inventories for the Companys Athletic Stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (RIM). The RIM is commonly used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its practicality. Under the retail method, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis. The RIM is a system of averages that requires managements estimates and assumptions regarding markups, markdowns and shrink, among others, and as such, could result in distortions of inventory amounts.  

Significant judgment is required for these estimates and assumptions, as well as to differentiate between promotional and other markdowns that may be required to correctly reflect merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company provides reserves based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. The failure to take permanent markdowns on a timely basis may result in an overstatement of cost under the retail inventory method. The decision to take permanent markdowns includes many factors, including the current environment, inventory levels, and the age of the item. Management believes this method and its related assumptions, which have been consistently applied, to be reasonable.  

Vendor Reimbursements  

In the normal course of business, the Company receives allowances from its vendors for markdowns taken. Vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales in the period in which the markdowns are taken. Vendor allowances contributed 20 basis points to the 2010 gross margin rate. The Company also has volume-related agreements with certain vendors, under which it receives rebates based on fixed percentages of cost purchases. These volume-related rebates are recorded in cost of sales when the product is sold and were not significant to the 2010 gross margin rate.  

The Company receives support from some of its vendors in the form of reimbursements for cooperative advertising and catalog costs for the launch and promotion of certain products. The reimbursements are agreed upon with vendors for specific advertising campaigns and catalogs. Cooperative income, to the extent that it reimburses specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to date, is recorded in SG&A in the same period as the associated expenses are incurred. Cooperative reimbursements amounted to approximately 24 percent and 11 percent of total advertising and catalog costs, respectively, in 2010. Reimbursements received that are in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to date are recognized as a reduction to the cost of merchandise and are reflected in cost of sales as the merchandise is sold and were not significant in 2010.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangibles  

The Company recognizes an impairment loss when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. Managements policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists, a triggering event, comprises measurable operating performance criteria at the division level as well as qualitative measures. If an analysis is necessitated by the occurrence of a triggering event, the Company uses assumptions, which are predominately identified from the Companys three-year strategic plans, in determining the impairment amount. In the calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset with the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with its estimated fair value. The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the Companys weighted-average cost of capital. Management believes its policy is reasonable and is consistently applied. Future expected cash flows are based upon estimates that, if not achieved, may result in significantly different results.  

The Company performs an impairment review of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. We consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in stock price and market capitalization in relation to the book value of the Company and macroeconomic conditions affecting retail. The Company has chosen to perform this review at the beginning of each fiscal year, and it is done in a two-step approach. The initial step requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. The second step  to evaluate goodwill of a reporting unit for impairment  is only required if the carrying value of that reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company used a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market-based approach to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The determination of discounted cash flows of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, earnings before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. The market approach requires judgment and uses one or more methods to compare the reporting unit with similar businesses, business ownership interests or securities that have been sold. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.  

The Company evaluated the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the reporting units, and concluded they are reasonable and are consistent with prior valuations.  

Owned trademarks and tradenames that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment. The fair values of purchased intangible assets are estimated and compared to their carrying values. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates, and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.  

The Companys review of goodwill did not result in any impairment charges for the years ended January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 as the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeds its carrying value. In 2010, the Company recorded a $10 million impairment charge related to its CCS tradename, primarily as a result of reduced revenue projections for this business.   

27 

Share-Based Compensation  

The Company estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company estimates the expected term of options granted using its historical exercise and post-vesting employment termination patterns, which the Company believes are representative of future behavior. Changing the expected term by one year changes the fair value by 6 to 8 percent depending if the change was an increase or decrease to the expected term. The Company estimates the expected volatility of its common stock at the grant date using a weighted-average of the Companys historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on the Companys common stock. A 50 basis point change in volatility would have a 1 percent change to the fair value. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The expected dividend yield is derived from the Companys historical experience. A 50 basis point change to the dividend yield would change the fair value by approximately 4 percent. The Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on its historical pre-vesting forfeiture data, which it believes are representative of future behavior, and periodically will revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model requires the use of subjective assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the options. The Company may elect to use different assumptions under the Black-Scholes option pricing model in the future if there is a difference between the assumptions used and the actual factors that become known over time.  

Pension and Postretirement Liabilities  

The Company determines its obligations for pension and postretirement liabilities based upon assumptions related to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on invested plan assets, salary increases, age, and mortality, among others. Management reviews all assumptions annually with its independent actuaries, taking into consideration existing and future economic conditions and the Companys intentions with regard to the plans.  

Long-Term Rate of Return Assumption  The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return expected to be earned on the plans assets and is recognized as a component of pension expense. The rate is based on the plans weighted-average target asset allocation, as well as historical and future expected performance of those assets. The target asset allocation is selected to obtain an investment return that is sufficient to cover the expected benefit payments and to reduce future contributions by the Company. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy. The weighted-average long-term rate of return used to determine 2010 pension expense was 7.22 percent. A decrease of 50 basis points in the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return would have increased 2010 pension expense by approximately $3 million. The actual return on plan assets in a given year typically differs from the expected long-term rate of return, and the resulting gain or loss is deferred and amortized into expense over the average life expectancy of its inactive participants.  

Discount Rate  An assumed discount rate is used to measure the present value of future cash flow obligations of the plans and the interest cost component of pension expense and postretirement income. The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys U.S. benefit obligations at January 29, 2011 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company matches the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys Canadian benefit obligations at January 29, 2011 was developed by using the plans bond portfolio indices, which match the benefit obligations. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the 2010 benefit obligations related to the Companys pension and postretirement plans were 4.98 percent and 4.60 percent, respectively. A decrease of 50 basis points in the weighted-average discount rate would have increased the accumulated benefit obligation of the pension plans at January 29, 2011 by approximately $29 million, while the effect on the postretirement plan would not have been significant. Such a decrease would not have significantly changed 2010 pension expense or postretirement income.   

28 

There is limited risk to the Company for increases in health care costs related to the postretirement plan as, beginning in 2001, new retirees have assumed the full expected costs and then-existing retirees have assumed all increases in such costs. A one percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would change the SERP Medical Plans accumulated benefit obligation by approximately $1 million.  

The Company expects to record postretirement income of approximately $5 million and pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2011.  

Income Taxes  

In accordance with GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognized for tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdiction and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset. Estimates of taxable income are based upon the Companys three-year strategic plans. A one percent change in the Companys overall statutory tax rate for 2010 would have resulted in an $8 million change in the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge or credit to income tax expense depending on whether such tax rate change was a decrease or an increase.  

The Company has operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals of tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual results could vary from these estimates.  

The Company expects its 2011 effective tax rate to approximate 37 percent. The actual rate will primarily depend upon the percentage of the Companys income earned in the United States as compared with international operations.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on the Companys present or future consolidated financial statements.
