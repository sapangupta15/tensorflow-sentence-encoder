Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 Overview  

 Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. REITs will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to distribute not less than 100% of their taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. In this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries.  

 We own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle centers. As of December 31, 2013, we owned or held an interest in 308 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 156 malls, 66 Premium Outlets, 62 community/lifestyle centers, 13 Mills, and 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 38 states and Puerto Rico. We have several Premium Outlets under development and have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors and big box tenants, underway at more than 25 properties in the U.S., Asia, and Mexico. Internationally, as of December 31, 2013, we had ownership interests in nine Premium Outlets in Japan, three Premium Outlets in South Korea, one Premium Outlet in Canada, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. In 2013, we acquired noncontrolling interests in five operating properties in Europe through our joint venture with McArthurGlen. Of the five properties, two are located in Italy and one each is located in Austria, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, we owned a 28.9% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 13 countries in Europe.  

 On December 13, 2013, we announced a plan to spin off our interests in 98 properties comprised of substantially all of our strip center business and our smaller enclosed malls into an independent, publicly traded REIT (SpinCo). The spin-off is expected to be effectuated through a pro rata special distribution of all of the outstanding common shares of SpinCo to holders of Simon Property common stock as of the distribution record date, and is expected to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At the time of the separation and distribution, SpinCo will own a percentage of the outstanding units of partnership interest of SpinCo L.P. that is equal to the percentage of outstanding units of partnership interest of the Operating Partnership owned by Simon Property, with the remaining units of SpinCo L.P. owned by the limited partners of the Operating Partnership. We expect the transaction will become effective in the second quarter of 2014. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including declaration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that SpinCo's registration statement on Form 10 is effective, filing and approval of SpinCo's listing application, customary third party consents, and formal approval and declaration of the distribution by our Board of Directors. We may, at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the spin-off or modify or change its terms.  

 We generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:   

base minimum rents,  

overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and  

recoverable expenditures such as property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.   

 Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.  

 We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following:   

attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,   

expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,   

selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,   

46 

Table of Contents   

generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and   

selling selective non-core assets.   

 We also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:   

establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,  

offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,  

selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and   

generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.   

 We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlets.  

 We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.  

 To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:   

provide the capital necessary to fund growth,  

maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and   

manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.   

 We consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable property NOI (NOI for properties owned and operating in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.  

 Results Overview  

 Diluted earnings per common share was $4.24 in 2013 as compared to $4.72 for 2012. The $0.48 decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily attributable to:   

a 2012 gain due to the acquisition of a controlling interest, sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities, and impairment charge on investment in unconsolidated entities, net of $510.0 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, primarily driven by a non-cash gain of $488.7 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held interest to fair value for those properties in which we now have a controlling interest,  

partially offset by a 2013 gain due to the sale or disposal of our interests in fourteen properties and the acquisition of a controlling interest in an outlet center of $107.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, and  

improved operating performance and core business fundamentals in 2013 and the impact of our acquisition and expansion activity.   

 Core business fundamentals improved during 2013 primarily driven by higher tenant sales and strong leasing activity. Our share of portfolio NOI grew by 10.0% in 2013 as compared to 2012. Comparable property NOI also grew 5.2% for our portfolio of U.S. malls and Premium Outlets. Total sales per square foot, or psf, increased 2.5% from $568 psf at December 31, 2012, to $582 psf at December 31, 2013, for the U.S. malls and Premium Outlets. Average base minimum rent for U.S. malls and Premium Outlets increased 4.0% to $42.34 psf as of December 31, 2013, from $40.73 psf as of December 31, 2012. Releasing spreads remained positive in the U.S. malls and Premium Outlets as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents than the expiring rental rates on the same space, resulting in a releasing spread (based on total tenant payments  base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $8.94 psf ($62.19 openings compared to $53.25 closings) as of December 31, 2013, representing a 16.8% increase over expiring payments. Ending occupancy for the U.S. malls and Premium Outlets was 96.1% as of December 31, 2013, as compared to 95.3% as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 80 basis points.

 Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2013 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 15 basis points to 4.84% as compared to 4.99% at December 31, 2012. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 19 basis points (5.14% at December 31, 2013 as compared to 5.33% at December 31, 2012) combined with a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 18 basis points (1.22% at December 31, 2013 as compared to 1.40% at December 31, 2012). At December 31, 2013, the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 5.4 years as compared to 5.9 years at December 31, 2012.  

 Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, included:   

the redemption at par or repayment at maturity of $504.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed rates ranging from 5.30% to 7.18%,  

repayment of $145.0 million on our $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility,   

new mortgage loan borrowings of $370.0 million on previously unencumbered properties,   

issuance of €750.0 million ($1.0 billion USD equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.375% with a maturity date of October 2, 2020,  

repayment of €422.0 million ($576.1 million USD equivalent) of borrowings on the Euro tranche of our Credit Facility and  

borrowings of $300.0 million on our Credit Facility on December 30, 2013 which we used to partially fund the Sawgrass Mills mortgage repayment on January 2, 2014; we repaid these Credit Facility borrowings in full on January 22, 2014.

 United States Portfolio Data  

 The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy; average base minimum rent per square foot; and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. For comparative purposes, we separate the information related to community/lifestyle centers and The Mills from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any properties located outside of the United States.  

 The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for:   

properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,  

properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and   

the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Percentage and basis point changes are representative of the change from the comparable prior period.   

 Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot. Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.  

 Total Sales per Square Foot. Total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12-month basis at owned GLA (for mall stores with less than 10,000 square feet) in the malls and all reporting tenants at the Premium Outlets and The Mills. Retail sales at owned GLA affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.

 Current Leasing Activities   

 During 2013, we signed 1,127 new leases and 1,711 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment, expansion, downsizing, and relocation) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 8.4 million square feet of which 6.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2012, we signed 1,217 new leases and 2,074 renewal leases, comprising approximately 10.3 million square feet of which 7.7 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $45.13 psf in 2013 and $40.46 psf in 2012 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $32.48 psf and $36.45 psf, respectively.

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.   

We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, occupancy or comparable sales per square foot. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.   

To maintain our status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a REIT. If we lost our REIT status, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.  

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.  

A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a   

51 

Table of Contents   

development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening.

 For the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions. In the following discussions of our results of operations, "comparable" refers to properties we owned and operated in both years in the year-to-year comparisons.  

 Year Ended December 31, 2013 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2012  

 Minimum rents increased $186.1 million during 2013, of which the property transactions accounted for $99.7 million of the increase. Comparable rents increased $86.4 million, or 3.2%, primarily attributable to an $83.9 million increase in base minimum rents. Overage rents increased $27.7 million, or 14.2%, as a result of an increase in tenant sales at the comparable properties in 2013 compared to 2012 of $20.7 million as well as an increase related to the property transactions of $7.0 million.  

53 

Table of Contents 

 Tenant reimbursements increased $102.6 million, due to a $40.4 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a $62.2 million, or 5.3%, increase in the comparable properties primarily due to annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance and higher reimbursements for the tenants' pro rata share of real estate taxes.  

 Total other income decreased $25.0 million, principally as a result of the following:   

a $18.3 million decrease in interest income primarily related to the repayment of related party loans and loans held for investment,  

a $12.4 million gain in 2012 on the sale of our investments in two multi-family residential facilities,   

an $8.4 million decrease in land sale activity, and  

a $7.7 million decrease in lease settlement income due to a higher number of terminated leases in 2012,   

partially offset by an increase related to a $7.9 million gain on the sale of a non-retail office building in 2013,   

a $7.7 million increase in financing and other fee revenue earned from joint ventures, net of eliminations, and   

a $6.2 million increase in net other activity.   

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $33.0 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions.  

 Real estate tax expense increased $25.6 million primarily due to an $14.9 million increase related to the property transactions.  

 Repairs and maintenance expense increased $4.6 million primarily as a result of increased snow removal costs compared to the prior year period.  

 During 2013, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $7.7 million whereas in the prior year the provision was $12.8 million. Both amounts reflect the overall strong economic health of our tenants.  

 Home and regional office costs increased $17.0 million primarily related to higher personnel costs.  

 Interest expense increased $10.1 million primarily due to an increase of $21.9 million related to the property transactions partially offset by the net impact of the financing activities and reduction in the effective overall borrowing rate as previously discussed.  

 Income and other taxes increased $23.9 million due to taxes related to certain of our international investments and an increase in state income taxes.  

 Income from unconsolidated entities increased $73.4 million primarily due to the increase in ownership in the joint venture properties acquired as part of the Mills transaction, the 2012 acquisition of an equity stake in Klépierre, our acquisition and expansion activity and favorable results of operations from joint venture properties partially offset by an extinguishment charge related to the refinancing of Aventura Mall.  

 During 2013, we increased our economic interest in three unconsolidated community centers and subsequently disposed of our interests in those properties. Additionally, we disposed of our interests in two malls, four community centers, five non-core retail properties and recorded a gain on the acquisition of an outlet center. The aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was approximately $107.5 million. During 2012, we disposed of our interest in GCI, four unconsolidated properties, and eight consolidated retail properties for a net gain of $43.7 million and acquired a controlling interest in nine properties previously accounted for under the equity method in the Mills transaction which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash gain of $488.7 million. In addition, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $22.4 million on our remaining investment in SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC, or SPG-FCM, which holds our investment in TMLP, representing the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.  

 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $53.2 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership and a decline in the percentage ownership of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership.

 Year Ended December 31, 2012 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2011  

 Minimum rents increased $351.1 million during 2012, of which the property transactions accounted for $280.4 million of the increase. Comparable rents increased $70.7 million, or 2.7%, primarily attributable to a $76.0 million increase in base minimum rents. Overage rents increased $54.9 million, or 39.0%, as a result of the property transactions and an increase in tenant sales in 2012 compared to 2011 at the comparable properties of $31.3 million.  

 Tenant reimbursements increased $163.0 million, due to a $141.8 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a $21.2 million, or 1.9%, increase in the comparable properties primarily due to annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance and higher reimbursements for the tenants' pro rata share of real estate taxes, offset partially by a decrease in utility recoveries due to lower electricity costs.  

 Total other income increased $4.2 million, principally as a result of the following:   

a $12.4 million increase from a gain on the sale of our investments in two multi-family residential facilities,   

an $11.7 million increase in land sale activity, and  

a $9.7 million increase in financing and other fee revenue earned from joint ventures net of eliminations,   

partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $24.8 million related to the repayment of related party loans and loans held for investment, and  

$4.8 million of net other activity.   

 Property operating expense increased $33.2 million primarily related to a $49.1 million increase attributable to the property transactions partially offset by a $15.9 million decrease in comparable property activity due primarily to our continued cost savings efforts.  

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $191.6 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions.  

 Real estate tax expense increased $49.5 million primarily due to a $44.3 million increase related to the property transactions.  

 During 2012, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $12.8 million whereas in the prior year the provision was $6.5 million. Both amounts reflect the overall strong economic health of our tenants.  

 General and administrative expense increased $10.8 million primarily as a result of increased long-term performance based incentive compensation costs including amortization of the CEO retention award which commenced mid-year 2011.  

 Marketable and non-marketable securities charges and realized gains, net, of $6.4 million in 2012 was the result of the sale of all of our investments in Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC and Capital & Counties Properties PLC for a gain of $82.7 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary non-cash impairment charges related to certain non-marketable investments in securities of $76.3 million.  

 Interest expense increased $143.5 million primarily due to an increase of $113.3 million related to the property transactions. The remainder of the increase resulted from the following:   

borrowings on the Euro tranche of the Credit Facility, and  

the issuance of unsecured notes in the first and fourth quarters of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011,   

partially offset by a lower effective overall borrowing rate,  

decreased interest expense related to the repayment of $536.2 million of mortgages at 19 properties during 2012,   

the payoff of a $735.0 million secured term loan, and  

the payoff of $231.0 million of unsecured notes in 2012 and $542.5 million of unsecured notes in 2011.   

 Income and other taxes increased $4.3 million due to income-based and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments.

Table of Contents 

 Income from unconsolidated properties increased $50.7 million as result of the property transactions, primarily due to the increase in ownership in the joint venture properties acquired as part of the Mills transaction, and favorable results of operations from the portfolio of joint venture properties.  

 During 2012, we disposed of our interest in GCI, four unconsolidated properties, and eight consolidated retail properties for a net gain of $43.7 million and acquired a controlling interest in nine properties previously accounted for under the equity method in the Mills transaction which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash gain of $488.7 million. In addition, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $22.4 million on our remaining investment in SPG-FCM, which holds our investment in TMLP, representing the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value. During 2011, we disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated mall, one consolidated mall, and four non-core retail properties, and acquired a controlling interest in a mall previously accounted for under the equity method. In addition, on December 31, 2011, a joint venture in which we had a 50% interest was dissolved and, as a result, distributed a portfolio of properties to us and our joint venture partner. We now consolidate the six properties we received in the distribution and recorded a non-cash gain representing the fair value of the net assets received in excess of the carrying value of our interest in the joint venture portfolio. These transactions resulted in an aggregate net gain in 2011 of $216.6 million.  

 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $64.0 million primarily due to an increase in the income of the Operating Partnership.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. We minimize the use of floating rate debt and may enter into floating rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps. Floating rate debt comprised only 7.5% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2013. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $3.4 billion during 2013. In addition, the Credit Facility and the $2.0 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under each of these facilities can be increased at our sole option as discussed further below.  

 Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $532.3 million during 2013 to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 as further discussed in "Cash Flows" below.  

 On December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion under the two facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion and letters of credit of $41.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the maximum amount outstanding under the two facilities was $1.6 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate was 1.05% for the year ended December 31, 2013.  

 We and the Operating Partnership have historically had access to public equity and long term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.  

 Our business model and status as a REIT requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. We may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facility and the Supplemental Facility to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2014.

 Table of Contents   

 Cash Flows   

 Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $3.4 billion during 2013, which includes distributions of $358.0 million for our share of excess proceeds from the refinancing of two joint venture properties. In addition, we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities of $473.2 million in 2013. These activities are further discussed below under "Financing and Debt." During 2013, we or the Operating Partnership also:   

funded the acquisition of an outlet center, deposits for the acquisition of an undeveloped land parcel, a long-term ground lease buyout, and an ownership interest in a European property management and development company and related outlet operating properties for $866.5 million,  

received proceeds of $274.1 million from the sale of two malls, seven community/lifestyle centers, and two other retail properties,  

paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling $1.7 billion,   

funded consolidated capital expenditures of $841.2 million (includes development and other costs of $42.7 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $553.5 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $245.0 million), and   

funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $143.1 million and construction loans to joint ventures of $99.1 million.   

 In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:   

excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,   

borrowings on our credit facilities,  

additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or  

additional equity raised in the public or private markets.   

 We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2014, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from our credit facilities, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.   

 Financing and Debt  

 Unsecured Debt   

 At December 31, 2013, our unsecured debt consisted of $13.9 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, net of discounts, $960.1 million outstanding under our Credit Facility, $212.2 million outstanding under our Supplemental Facility, and $240.0 million outstanding under an unsecured term loan. The December 31, 2013 balance on the Credit Facility included $660.1 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Euro-denominated borrowings and the entire balance on the Supplemental Facility on such date consisted of Yen-denominated borrowings, both of which are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our international investments.  

 On December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion under the two credit facilities. The maximum outstanding balance of the credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.6 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.3 billion. Letters of credit of $41.9 million were outstanding under the two facilities as of December 31, 2013.  

 The Credit Facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion can be increased at our sole option to $5.0 billion during its term. The Credit Facility will initially mature on October 30, 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. As of December 31, 2013, the base interest rate on the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 95 basis points (reflects a five basis point reduction effective May 16, 2013) with an additional facility fee of 15 basis points. In addition, the Credit  

57 

Table of Contents 

Facility provides for a money market competitive bid option program that allows us to hold auctions to achieve lower pricing for short-term borrowings. The Credit Facility also includes a $2.0 billion multi-currency tranche.  

 The Supplemental Facility's borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion can be increased at our sole option to $2.5 billion during its term. The Supplemental Facility will initially mature on June 30, 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. As of December 31, 2013, the base interest rate on the Supplemental Facility was LIBOR plus 95 basis points (reflects a five basis point reduction effective May 16, 2013) with an additional facility fee of 15 basis points. Like the Credit Facility, the Supplemental Facility provides for a money market competitive bid option program and allows for multi-currency borrowings.  

 During 2013, we redeemed at par or repaid at maturity $504.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed rates ranging from 5.30% to 7.18% with cash on hand. In addition, we repaid a $240.0 million mortgage loan with the proceeds from a $240.0 million unsecured term loan. The term loan has a capacity of up to $300.0 million, bears interest at LIBOR plus 110 basis points and matures on February 28, 2016 with two available one-year extension options.  

 On October 2, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued €750.0 million ($1.0 billion USD equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.375% with a maturity date of October 2, 2020. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down a portion of Euro-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility and fund the acquisition of various assets in the McArthurGlen transactions further discussed in Note 7. These notes are designated as a net investment hedge of our Euro-denominated international investments.  

 On December 30, 2013, we borrowed $300.0 million on our Credit Facility to partially fund the Sawgrass Mills mortgage repayment on January 2, 2014. These Credit Facility borrowings were repaid in full on January 22, 2014 using unsecured notes proceeds as discussed below.  

 On January 21, 2014, the Operating Partnership issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with a maturity date of February 1, 2019 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.75% with a maturity date of February 1, 2024. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.   

 Mortgage Debt   

 Total mortgage indebtedness was $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During 2013, we added $370.0 million in new mortgage loans on previously unencumbered assets with a weighted average interest rate of 4.04%.  

 On January 2, 2014, we repaid the $820.0 million outstanding mortgage at Sawgrass Mills originally maturing July 1, 2014 with cash on hand and the borrowings on our Credit Facility as discussed above.  

 In November 2013, one of our joint venture properties refinanced its $430.0 million mortgage maturing December 11, 2017 with a $1.2 billion mortgage that matures December 1, 2020. The fixed interest rate was reduced from 5.91% to 3.75% as a result of this transaction and an extinguishment charge of $82.8 million was incurred.   

 Covenants   

 Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of December 31, 2013, we are in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.  

 At December 31, 2013, we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 80 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 80 properties, including seven separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 27 properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt. If the borrower fails to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral. At December 31, 2013, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually, or giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Summary of Financing   

 Our consolidated debt, adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments, and the effective weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):

 Contractual Obligations and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   

 In regards to long-term debt arrangements, the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2013, and subsequent years thereafter (dollars in thousands) assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities including applicable exercise of available extension options:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Represents principal maturities only and therefore, excludes net premiums of $25,449. 

(2)Variable rate interest payments are estimated based on the LIBOR rate at December 31, 2013. 

(3)Represents contractual commitments for capital projects and services at December 31, 2013. Our share of estimated 2014 development, redevelopment and expansion activity is further discussed below in the "Development Activity" section. 

(4)Represents only the minimum non-cancellable lease period, excluding applicable lease extension and renewal options.   

 Certain of our consolidated properties have redemption features whereby the remaining interest in a property or portfolio of properties can be redeemed at the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside our control. These amounts are accounted for as temporary equity within limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled $164.9 million at December 31, 2013.  

 Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 7 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $190.8 million (of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of $83.0 million). Mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.

 Acquisitions and Dispositions   

 Buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our stockholders' best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner's interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.  

 Acquisitions. On January 10, 2014, we acquired one of our partner's remaining redeemable interests in a portfolio of ten properties for approximately $113.3 million subject to a pre-existing contractual arrangement. The amount paid to acquire the interests in the seven properties which were previously consolidated is included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interest in properties in the accompanying December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.  

 During the second quarter of 2013, we signed a definitive agreement with McArthurGlen, an owner, developer, and manager of designer outlets, to form one or more joint ventures to invest in certain of its existing designer outlets, development projects, and its property management and development companies. In conjunction with that agreement, we purchased a noncontrolling interest in the property management and development companies of McArthurGlen, and a noncontrolling interest in a development property located in Vancouver, British Columbia. On August 2, 2013 we acquired a noncontrolling interest in Ashford Designer Outlets in Kent, UK. On October 16, 2013 we completed the remaining transactions contemplated by our previously announced definitive agreement with McArthurGlen by acquiring noncontrolling interests in portions of four existing McArthurGlen Designer Outlets  Parndorf (Vienna, Austria), La Reggia (Naples, Italy), Noventa di Piave (Venice, Italy), and Roermond (Roermond, Netherlands). Our legal ownership interests in these entities range from 22.5% to 90%.  

 On May 30, 2013, we acquired a 100% interest in a 390,000 square foot outlet center located near Portland, Oregon for cash consideration of $146.7 million.  

 Dispositions. We continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.  

 During 2013, we increased our economic interest in three unconsolidated community centers and subsequently disposed of our interests in those properties. Additionally, we disposed of our interests in eight consolidated retail properties and three unconsolidated retail properties. The aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was approximately $80.2 million.  

 On August 8, 2013, we disposed of our interest in an office property located in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The gain on the sale was $7.9 million which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.   

 Development Activity   

 New Domestic Development. During the third quarter of 2013, we began construction on Charlotte Premium Outlets, a 400,000 square foot project located in Charlotte, North Carolina. We own a 50% noncontrolling interest in this project, which is a joint venture with Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. The center is expected to open in July of 2014. Our estimated share of the cost of this project is $46.0 million.  

 In addition, during the third quarter we began construction on Twin Cities Premium Outlets, a 410,000 square foot project located in Eagan, Minnesota. We own a 35% noncontrolling interest in this project. The center is expected to open in August of 2014. Our estimated share of the cost of this project is $38.0 million.  

 On August 22, 2013, we opened St. Louis Premium Outlets, a 350,000 square foot upscale outlet center located in Chesterfield, Missouri. We own a 60% noncontrolling interest in this project, which is a joint venture with Woodmont Outlets. Our share of the cost of this new center was approximately $50.0 million. The center was 100% leased at opening.  

 On April 4, 2013, we opened Phoenix Premium Outlets in Chandler, Arizona, a 360,000 square foot upscale outlet center. The cost of this new center, in which we have a 100% interest, was approximately $70.0 million. The center was 100% leased at opening.

 Domestic Redevelopments and Expansions. We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. We also have reinstituted redevelopment and expansion initiatives which we had previously reduced given the downturn in the economy. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors and big box tenants, are underway at more than 25 properties in the U.S.  

 We expect our share of development costs for 2014 related to new development, redevelopment, or expansion initiatives to be approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. Our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 10-12% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects.  

 Capital Expenditures on Consolidated Properties. The following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 International Development Activity. We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our share of international development costs for 2014 will be approximately $180.0 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.  

 The following table describes these new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of December 31, 2013 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Dividends  

 Common stock dividends during 2013 aggregated $4.65 per share. Common stock dividends during 2012 aggregated $4.10 per share. In January of 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock payable on February 28, 2014 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2014. We must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a non-cash expense. Our future dividends and future distributions of the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, and the amount required to maintain our status as a REIT.

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, costs of common area maintenance, risks related to our international investments and activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may update that discussion in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO, diluted FFO per share, NOI and comparable property NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.  

 We determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP:   

excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,  

excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes,   

excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of previously depreciated retail operating properties,   

excluding impairment charges of depreciable real estate,  

plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest, and  

all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.   

 We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties.  

 We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate.  

 You should understand that our computation of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures:   

do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,  

should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and  

are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:   

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets;  

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and   

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

 We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992).  

 Based on that assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
