 Business Overview  

 As a global business, AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2010, the Company posted strong sales and established records for operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The impact of contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2010 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2010 were:  

       In 2010, sales were $2.47 billion, an increase of $372.6 million or 18% from 2009, on internal growth of approximately 15% in the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 12% in the Electromechanical Group (EMG) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, and contributions from the 2009 and 2010 acquisitions.   

       Net income for 2010 was $283.9 million, an increase of $78.1 million or 37.9% when compared with $205.8 million in 2009.   

       During 2010, the Company completed the following acquisitions:    

       In January 2010, the Company acquired Sterling Ultra Precision, a privately held reseller of machine tools for the ophthalmic lens market.   

       In April 2010, the Company acquired Imago Scientific Instruments, a privately held manufacturer of 3D atom probes.   

       In June 2010, the Company acquired Technical Services for Electronics (TSE), a manufacturer of engineered interconnect solutions for the medical device industry.   

       In July 2010, the Company acquired Haydon Enterprises, a leader in linear actuators and lead screw assemblies for the medical, industrial equipment, aerospace, analytical instrument, computer peripheral and semiconductor industries.   

       In August 2010, the Company acquired American Reliances Power Division (AMREL Power), a provider of highly differentiated direct current power supplies and electronic loads for the automated test equipment market.   

       In November 2010, the Company acquired Atlas Material Testing Technology LLC (Atlas), the worlds leading provider of weathering test instruments and related testing and consulting services.    

       Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by operating activities that totaled $423.0 million, a $58.3 million or 16.0% increase from 2009.

 Results of Operations  

 In 2010, the Company posted strong sales and established records for operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as contributions from acquisitions completed in 2010 and the acquisitions of High Standard Aviation in January 2009 and Ameron Global in December 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company began to experience increased order rates which continued through 2010. The full year impact of the 2010 acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities should have a positive impact on our 2011 results.  

 Net sales for 2010 were $2,471.0 million, an increase of $372.6 million or 17.8% when compared with net sales of $2,098.4 million in 2009. Net sales for EIG were $1,324.1 million in 2010, an increase of 15.5% from sales of $1,146.6 million in 2009. Net sales for EMG were $1,146.8 million in 2010, an increase of 20.5% from sales of $951.8 million in 2009. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2010 was driven by strong internal sales growth of approximately 13%, with no impact from foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

 Total international sales for 2010 were $1,211.3 million or 49.0% of consolidated net sales, an increase of $179.6 million or 17.4% when compared with international sales of $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of consolidated net sales in 2009. The $179.6 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above, as well as continued expansion into Asia, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $564.5 million in 2010, an increase of $150.4 million or 36.3% compared with $414.1 million in 2009. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2010 were $2,651.3 million, an increase of $623.2 million or 30.7% when compared with $2,028.1 million in 2009. Throughout most of 2009, the Company experienced lower order rates primarily as a result of the global economic recession, which began in late 2008 and continued through most of 2009. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2010, internal order growth was approximately 23%, excluding a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by both the Companys differentiated and cost-driven businesses, with the acquisitions mentioned above accounting for the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2010 was $828.8 million, an increase of $180.4 million or 27.8% when compared with $648.4 million at December 31, 2009.  

 Segment operating income for 2010 was $526.6 million, an increase of $127.1 million or 31.8% when compared with segment operating income of $399.5 million in 2009. Segment operating income, as a percentage of sales, increased to 21.3% in 2010 from 19.0% in 2009. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the leveraged impact of the Companys net sales increase noted above, as well as the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives, which includes the impact of the 2008 restructuring.  

 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2010 were $296.5 million, an increase of $42.4 million or 16.7% when compared with $254.1 million in 2009. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 12.0% for 2010, compared with 12.1% in 2009. Selling expense increased $32.4 million or 14.7% for 2010, which is in line with internal sales growth. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 10.3% for 2010, compared with 10.5% for 2009. Additionally, the Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased approximately 11.1%.   

 23   
 Corporate administrative expenses for 2010 were $43.1 million, an increase of $9.9 million or 29.8% when compared with $33.2 million in 2009. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.7% for 2010, compared with 1.6% in 2009. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher compensation related expenses, as well as other costs necessary to grow the business.  

 Consolidated operating income was $482.2 million or 19.5% of sales for 2010, an increase of $116.1 million or 31.7% when compared with $366.1 million or 17.4% of sales in 2009.  

 Interest expense was $67.5 million for 2010, a decrease of $1.3 million or 1.9% when compared with $68.8 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the repayment of 40 million British-pound-denominated debt under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of 2009 and 50 million British-pound-denominated senior note in the third quarter of 2010, partially offset by the issuance of an 80 million British-pound-denominated senior note in the third quarter of 2010.  

 Other expenses, net were $8.4 million for 2010, an increase of $5.7 million when compared with $2.7 million in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition related expenses.  

 The effective tax rate for 2010 was 30.1% compared with 30.2% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 primarily reflects the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and the benefits obtained from international and state income tax planning initiatives. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

 Net income for 2010 was $283.9 million, an increase of $78.1 million or 37.9% when compared with $205.8 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 was $1.76, an increase of $0.49 or 38.6% when compared with $1.27 per diluted share in 2009.  

 Segment Results  

 EIGs sales totaled $1,324.1 million for 2010, an increase of $177.5 million or 15.5% when compared with $1,146.6 million in 2009. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 15%, with no impact from foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIGs process, power and industrial businesses. The acquisition of Atlas primarily accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EIGs operating income was $316.2 million for 2010, an increase of $83.3 million or 35.8% when compared with $232.9 million in 2009. EIGs operating margins were 23.9% of sales for 2010 compared with 20.3% of sales in 2009. The increase in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Groups increase in sales noted above, as well as the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

 EMGs sales totaled $1,146.8 million for 2010, an increase of $195.0 million or 20.5% from $951.8 million in 2009. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 12%, with no impact from foreign currency translation. The acquisitions of Ameron Global, TSE and Haydon Enterprises primarily accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EMGs operating income was $210.4 million for 2010, an increase of $43.8 million or 26.3% when compared with $166.6 million in 2009. EMGs operating margins were 18.3% of sales for 2010 compared with 17.5% of sales in 2009. EMGs increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the leveraged impact of the Groups higher sales, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above.

 Results of Operations  

 In 2009, the Company posted solid sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow given the global economic recession. The Companys results include contributions from acquisitions completed in 2009 and the acquisitions of Motion Control Group (MCG), Drake Air (Drake) and Newage Testing Instruments in February 2008, Reading Alloys in April 2008, Vision Research, Inc. in June 2008, the programmable power business of Xantrex Technology, Inc. (Xantrex Programmable) in August 2008 and Muirhead Aerospace Limited (Muirhead) in November 2008. The impact of the global economic recession stabilized in the third quarter of 2009, with improved operating results in the fourth quarter of 2009 in most of the Companys markets when compared to the previous quarters of 2009.  

 Net sales for 2009 were $2,098.4 million, a decrease of $432.7 million or 17.1% when compared with net sales of $2,531.1 million in 2008. Net sales for EIG were $1,146.6 million in 2009, a decrease of 18.3% from sales of $1,402.7 million in 2008. Net sales for EMG were $951.8 million in 2009, a decrease of 15.7% from sales of $1,128.5 million in 2008. The decline in net sales was primarily attributable to lower order rates as a result of the global economic recession, partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The Companys internal sales declined approximately 21% in 2009, which excludes a 2% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above offset approximately 6% of the Companys internal sales decline.  

 Total international sales for 2009 were $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of consolidated net sales, a decrease of $193.8 million or 15.8% when compared with international sales of $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated net sales in 2008. The decline in international sales resulted from decreased international sales from base businesses of $272.5 million, which includes the effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2008. The Company maintains a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia by both reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $400.6 million in 2009, a decrease of $77.9 million or 16.3% compared with $478.5 million in 2008. Export shipments declined primarily due to decreased exports from the base businesses, partially offset by the acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2009 were $2,028.1 million, a decrease of $533.4 million or 20.8% when compared with $2,561.5 million in 2008. Throughout most of 2009, the Company experienced lower order rates as a result of the global economic recession. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2009 was $648.4 million, a decrease of $70.2 million or 9.8% when compared with $718.6 million at December 31, 2008.  

 Segment operating income for 2009 was $399.5 million, a decrease of $82.4 million or 17.1% when compared with segment operating income of $481.9 million in 2008. Segment operating income, as a percentage of sales, was 19.0% in both 2009 and 2008. The decrease in segment operating income resulted primarily from the decrease in sales noted above and higher defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by profit contributions made by the acquisitions and cost reduction initiatives, including $135 million of cost savings achieved in 2009 primarily from the restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges.  

 SG&A expenses for 2009 were $254.1 million, a decrease of $68.5 million or 21.2% when compared with $322.6 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 12.1% for 2009, compared with 12.7% in 2008. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of lower sales and the Companys cost savings initiatives. Additionally, 2008 SG&A expenses include both a $7.1 million charge, recorded in corporate administrative expenses, related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2005 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million of SG&A expense related to fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 22%, which was in line with the Companys 2009 sales decline. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 10.5% for 2009, compared with 10.8% in 2008 due to the previously mentioned cost savings initiatives.   

 25   
 Corporate administrative expenses for 2009 were $33.2 million, a decrease of $16.0 million or 32.5% when compared with $49.2 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.6% for 2009, compared with 1.9% in 2008. The decrease in corporate administrative expenses was driven by the equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second quarter of 2008, lower short-term incentive compensation in 2009 and the Companys cost saving initiatives, including the restructuring activities, noted above.  

 Consolidated operating income was $366.1 million or 17.4% of sales for 2009, a decrease of $66.6 million or 15.4% when compared with $432.7 million or 17.1% of sales in 2008.  

 Interest expense was $68.8 million for 2009, an increase of $5.1 million or 8.0% when compared with $63.7 million in 2008. The increase was due to the full-year impact of the funding of the long-term private placement senior notes in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, partially offset by the repayment of 40 million British-pound-denominated debt under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of 2009.  

 The effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.2% compared with 32.6% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate for 2009 primarily reflects the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and the benefits obtained from state and international income tax planning initiatives. The higher effective tax rate for 2008 primarily reflects an increase in state and foreign income taxes and the impact of accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock amortization, offset by the impact of settlements of various income tax issues with U.S. taxing authorities and a favorable agreement in the United Kingdom related to deductible interest expense for which previously unrecognized tax benefits were recognized. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

 Net income for 2009 was $205.8 million, a decrease of $41.2 million or 16.7% when compared with $247.0 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2009 was $1.27, a decrease of $0.26 or 17.0% when compared with $1.53 per diluted share in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.17 per diluted share.  

 Segment Results  

 EIGs sales totaled $1,146.6 million for 2009, a decrease of $256.1 million or 18.3% when compared with $1,402.7 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an internal sales decline of approximately 20%, excluding an unfavorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIGs process and industrial products businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease were the 2008 acquisitions of Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex Programmable.  

 EIGs operating income was $232.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $73.9 million or 24.1% when compared with $306.8 million in 2008. EIGs operating margins were 20.3% of sales for 2009 compared with 21.9% of sales in 2008. The decrease in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the decrease in sales noted above, predominantly by weakness in the aerospace aftermarket, process and industrial businesses and higher defined benefit pension expense, which was partially offset by the cost savings achieved from the restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million had a negative impact on EIGs operating margins of 140 basis points.  

 EMGs sales totaled $951.8 million for 2009, a decrease of $176.7 million or 15.7% from $1,128.5 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an internal sales decline of approximately 21%, excluding an unfavorable 3% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by the engineered materials, interconnects and packaging (EMIP) and cost-driven motors businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease were the 2009 acquisition of High Standard Aviation and the 2008 acquisitions of Drake, MCG, Reading Alloys and Muirhead.  

 EMGs operating income was $166.6 million for 2009, a decrease of $8.6 million or 4.9% when compared with $175.2 million in 2008. EMGs decrease in operating income was driven by the decrease in sales noted above,    

 26   
 predominantly by weakness in the EMIP businesses, which was partially offset by profit contributions made by the acquisitions mentioned above and the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $19.4 million. EMGs operating margins were 17.5% of sales for 2009 compared with 15.5% of sales in 2008. The increase in operating margins was primarily driven by Operational Excellence capabilities and cost reduction initiatives throughout the Group, including the cost savings achieved from the restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $19.4 million had a negative impact on operating margins of 170 basis points.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $523.5 million, a decrease of $100.2 million or 16.1% when compared with net sales of $623.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for EIG were $286.0 million in 2009, a decrease of 20.9% from sales of $361.6 million in 2008. Net sales for EMG were $237.5 million in 2009, a decrease of 9.4% from sales of $262.1 million in 2008. The Companys internal sales decline was approximately 20%, which excludes a 2% favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above offset approximately 2% of the Companys internal sales decline.  

 The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.17 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low-cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the Companys workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $51.9 million, an increase of $8.1 million or 18.5% when compared with $43.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.32, an increase of $0.05 or 17.1% when compared with $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.17 per diluted share.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $423.0 million in 2010, an increase of $58.3 million or 16.0% when compared with $364.7 million in 2009. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $78.2 million increase in net income and a $17.6 million reduction in defined benefit pension contributions paid. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher overall operating working capital levels necessary to grow the Companys businesses. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $383.8 million in 2010, compared to $331.6 million in 2009. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $545.9 million in 2010, compared with $428.0 million in 2009. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).   

 27   
 Cash used for investing activities totaled $566.8 million in 2010, compared with $106.3 million in 2009. In 2010, the Company paid $538.6 million for six business acquisitions, net of cash received, compared with $72.9 million paid for three business acquisitions, net of cash received, in 2009. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $39.2 million in 2010, compared with $33.1 million in 2009.  

 Cash provided by financing activities totaled $62.6 million in 2010, compared with $102.5 million of cash used for financing activities in 2009. The change in financing cash flow was primarily the result of the net total borrowings increase described further below, partially offset by $78.6 million used for repurchases of 3.1 million shares of the Companys common stock in 2010. No shares were repurchased in 2009. In January 2010, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $75 million in the authorization for the repurchase of its common stock. This increase was added to the $68.5 million that remained available at December 31, 2009 from existing authorizations approved in 2008, for a total of $143.5 million available for repurchases of the Companys common stock. At December 31, 2010, $64.9 million was available under the current Board authorization for future share repurchases.  

 In 2010, net total borrowings increased by $139.3 million, compared with a net total borrowings decrease of $92.4 million in 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company paid in full an expiring 50 million British pound ($78.2 million) 5.96% senior note. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company issued an 80 million British pound ($124.8 million at December 31, 2010) 4.68% senior note due in September 2020. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a 40 million British pound ($62.0 million) borrowing under the revolving credit facility. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a 10.5 million British pound ($16.9 million) floating-rate term note.  

 The Companys revolving credit facilitys total borrowing capacity is $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The facility expires in June 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $437.3 million available under its revolving credit facility, including the $100 million accordion feature. At December 31, 2010, $92.0 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility.  

 At December 31, 2010, total debt outstanding was $1,168.5 million, compared with $1,041.7 million at December 31, 2009, with no significant maturities until 2012. The debt-to-capital ratio was 39.7% at December 31, 2010, compared with 39.9% at December 31, 2009. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders equity) was 36.2% at December 31, 2010, compared with 33.7% at December 31, 2009. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 Additional financing activities for 2010 include the receipt of net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $21.5 million compared with $11.6 million in 2009. Cash dividends paid were $28.6 million in 2010, compared with $25.6 million in 2009.  

 As a result of all of the Companys cash flow activities in 2010, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 totaled $163.2 million, compared with $246.4 million at December 31, 2009. The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

 Other Commitments  

 The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $23.2 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2010. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.  

 The Company may, from time to time, repurchase its long-term debt in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon availability, market conditions and other factors.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby    

 29   
 materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $18.3 million, $16.0 million and $16.1 million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $10.6 million, $8.2 million and $12.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.    

       Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $6.0 million and $5.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.    

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.     

 30   
 The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  

 The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 26% to 406% for each of the Companys reporting units.  

 The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.  

 The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2010, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $1,818.3 million or 47.6% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.  

 Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.  

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2010, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent      

 31   
      with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2010 pension cost was 5.90% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.98% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2010 and determining the 2011 defined benefit pension cost is 5.6% for U.S. plans and 5.71% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2010 of 8.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.97% for foreign plans. The Company will use 6.96% for the foreign plans in 2011 and expects to lower the U.S. plans rate to 8.0% in 2011. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2010 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2011. The foreign plans rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.97% in 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $3.2 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans as compared with pre-tax pension expense of $10.3 million recognized for these plans in 2009. The Company estimates its 2011 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax income to be approximately $7.9 million.    

 All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.  

 To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during 2010 which totaled $3.6 million, compared with $21.1 million in 2009. The Company anticipates making approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.    

 The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

 The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

 Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards  

 In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures related to fair value measurements, providing greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2, and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted the applicable provisions within ASU 2010-06 effective January 1, 2010. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the level 3 disclosures of ASU 2010-06 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  

 In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09, Subsequent Events (ASU 2010-09). ASU 2010-09 removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date in both the issued and revised financial statements for which the Company evaluated events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASU 2010-09 was effective as of February 2010.  

 In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition  Milestone Method (ASU 2010-17). ASU 2010-17 establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research or development arrangements. In addition, it requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. ASU 2010-17 is effective for the Company prospectively beginning January 1, 2011. The Company has evaluated ASU 2010-17 and does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (ASU 2010-29). ASU 2010-29 addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma disclosure requirement for business combinations. ASU 2010-29 requires disclosure of pro forma revenue and earnings for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period for both the current and any comparable periods reported. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the disclosure requirements of ASU 2010-29 that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.  

 Internal Reinvestment  

 Capital Expenditures  

 Capital expenditures were $39.2 million or 1.6% of sales in 2010, compared with $33.1 million or 1.6% of sales in 2009. 52% of the expenditures in 2010 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2010 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2011 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 1.6% of sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.  

 Product Development and Engineering  

 The Company is committed to research, product development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, product development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $112.1 million, $101.4 million and $115.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $6.4 million, $5.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $56.8 million, $50.5 million and $57.5 million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.

 Environmental Matters  

 Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2010, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

 Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $31.3 million and $27.0 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2010, the Company recorded $6.4 million in reserves, related primarily to a 2010 business acquisition. These reserves relate to the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at an owned site associated with the acquired business. Additionally, the Company spent $2.1 million on environmental matters in 2010. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 include reserves of $18.9 million and $19.2 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $14.2 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.  

 The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 and, as a result, the Company is performing investigation and remediation of a formerly owned site under a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement.  

 The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information    

 34   
 and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.  

 Market Risk  

 The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  

 The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Chinese renminbi, the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

 The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

 Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

 Forward-Looking Information  

 Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
