PART I

Item 1.Business

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (“Interpublic,” “IPG,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by Harrison K. McCann. The company has operated under the Interpublic name since January 1961.

About Us

We are one of the world’s premier global advertising and marketing services companies. Through our 42,000 employees in all major world markets, our companies specialize in consumer advertising, digital marketing, communications planning and media buying, public relations and specialized communications disciplines. Our agencies create customized marketing programs for many of the world's largest companies. Comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world, as they seek to build brands, increase sales of their products and services and gain market share.

The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs. Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving one agency to long-term, fully integrated campaigns created by multiple IPG agencies working together. With offices in over 100 countries, we can operate in a single region, or deliver global integrated programs.

The role of our holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet clients’ needs. Based in New York City, our holding company sets company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy, establishes financial management and operational controls, guides personnel policy, directs collaborative inter-agency programs, conducts investor relations, provides enterprise risk management and oversees mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we provide limited centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance, executive compensation management and recruitment assistance, employee benefits, marketing information retrieval and analysis, internal audit, legal services, real estate expertise and travel services. 

Our Brands

Interpublic is home to some of the world’s best-known and most innovative communications specialists. We have three global networks, McCann Worldgroup ("McCann"), Draftfcb and Lowe & Partners ("Lowe"), that provide integrated, large-scale advertising and marketing solutions for clients, and two global media services companies, UM and Initiative, operating under the Mediabrands umbrella. We also have premier domestic integrated and interactive agencies that are industry leaders as well as a range of best-in-class specialized communications assets.

•McCann offers a full range of communications tools and resources to many of the world's top companies and most famous brands, positioning McCann to meet client demands in all regions of the world and in all marketing disciplines. McCann Erickson Advertising has operations in over 100 countries. MRM Worldwide is among our industry's largest global digital and customer relationship management ("CRM") networks. Momentum Worldwide is a leader in experiential marketing and promotions, as is McCann Healthcare Worldwide in healthcare communications.

•Draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients seeking creative and accountable marketing programs delivered in a media-neutral manner under a unified, integrated business. The company has its roots in both consumer advertising and behavioral, data-driven direct marketing. We believe the agency is the first global, behavior-based, creative and accountable marketing communications organization operating as a financially and structurally integrated business unit.

•Lowe is a premier creative agency that operates in the world’s most dynamic growth markets. Lowe's core strength is developing high-value ideas that connect with popular culture and drive business results. This is evident in the agency's global creative rankings and strong local operations in major key markets, such as Deutsch (U.S.), DLKW/Lowe (U.K.), Lowe Lintas (India) and BorghiErh/Lowe (Brazil).

•Mediabrands delivers on the scale and breadth of our media capabilities, making investment decisions for tens of billions of dollars of client marketing budgets, yet retains a nimble, collaborative culture. UM and Initiative seek to deliver business results by advising clients on how to navigate an increasingly complex and digital marketing landscape. Specialist brands within Mediabrands focus on areas such as the targeting and aggregation of audiences in the digital space, hyper-local marketing, media barter and a range of other capabilities.

•Our domestic integrated independent agencies include some of advertising's most recognizable and storied agency brands, including Campbell-Ewald, Hill Holliday, The Martin Agency and Mullen. The marketing programs created by this group incorporate all media channels, CRM, public relations and other marketing activities and have helped build some of the most powerful brands in the U.S., across all sectors and industries.

•We also have exceptional marketing specialists across a range of disciplines. These include Jack Morton (experiential marketing), Octagon (sports marketing), industry-leading public relations agencies such as Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris, FutureBrand (corporate branding), and our digital specialist agencies, led by R/GA and HUGE, which are among the industry's most award-winning digital agencies. Our healthcare communications specialists reside within our three global brands, McCann, Draftfcb and Lowe.

We list approximately 85 of our companies on our website’s “Company Finder” tool, with descriptions and office locations for each. To learn more about our broad range of capabilities, visit our website at http://www.interpublic.com.

Market Strategy

We operate in a media landscape that is evolving at a rapid pace. Media channels continue to fragment, and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment. To stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives, we have made and continue to make significant investments in creative and strategic talent in fast-growth digital marketing channels and high-growth geographic regions and world markets. In addition, we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through mergers and strategic alliances, as well as the development of internal programs that encourage intra-company collaboration. As appropriate, we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that complement our agencies' skill sets and capabilities.

In recent years, we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market. These include:

•We re-organized our media operations under a single management structure, Mediabrands, to reinvent how we plan, buy and measure media investment on behalf of our clients. We have also aligned a spectrum of specialist media companies under this structure. Additionally, we have invested in technology and analytics, including the launch of the IPG Media Lab in New York in 2011, a highly advanced resource for our clients. Since launch in 2008, Mediabrands has delivered industry-leading performance and growth.

•We moved Lowe to a hub model, focused on a smaller and more strategic global footprint, and significantly revamped its management team in an effort to turn around its operating performance. Once this approach began to yield positive results, we strengthened Lowe's capabilities in the key Brazil and U.K. markets through acquisitions and in the U.S. by aligning Deutsch and Lowe in North America to create a more powerful offering from which to service and source multinational clients.

•Five years ago, we combined accountable marketing and consumer advertising agencies in the unique global offering of Draftfcb, which is now operational throughout all world markets.

•At our marketing services division, Constituency Management Group (“CMG”), we continue to strengthen our market leading public relations and events marketing specialists. In recent years, we built out significant social media practices across CMG agencies and expanded our operations in Latin America, China and the Middle East.

•Our McCann unit continues the transformation of its offering under new global leadership with the delivery of best-in-class integrated marketing communications solutions in all geographic regions for the world's largest multinational advertisers.

Digital Growth

Demand for our digital marketing services continues to evolve rapidly. In order to meet this need and provide high-value resources to clients, we have in recent years focused our investment in embedding digital talent and technology throughout the organization. This reflects our belief that digital marketing cannot be treated as a stand-alone function, but should, instead, be integrated within all of our companies, mirroring the way in which consumers incorporate digital media into their other media habits, and, ultimately, their day-to-day life. Recruiting and developing digital expertise at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is an area in which we continue to invest.

To meet the changing needs of the marketplace, we have acquired or incubated specialty digital assets, such as Reprise Media (search engine marketing), HUGE (e-commerce solutions), Cadreon (demand-side platform) and The IPG Media Lab. We have also continued to invest in existing digital assets such as R/GA, a digital agency and industry leader in the development of award-winning interactive campaigns for global clients, as well as MRM, a leading global digital agency. These companies have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters, while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within IPG.

Fast-Growth Regions

We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to invest and grow in fast-growth geographic regions. In recent years, we have made significant investments in India and Brazil, further strengthening our leadership position in these high-growth, developing markets. Transactions completed in Brazil include the 2011 acquisition of S2 Publicom, a leading public relations

company and the 2010 acquisition of CuboCC, a new media and digital marketing services company. Further, our operations in India continue to be best-in-class as we support our strong growth in the region with partnerships and talent investment, giving us a leadership position in this important market. We also hold a majority stake in the Middle East Communication Networks (“MCN”), among the region's premier marketing services companies. MCN is headquartered in Dubai, with 60 offices across 14 countries. Our partner in Russia is an acknowledged leader in that country. In China, where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services, we continue to invest organically in talent and behind our agency brands. Additional areas of investment in 2011 included key Asia Pacific markets.

Acquisition Strategy

We feel that our company has the appropriate set of assets, capabilities and geographic coverage to succeed in today's media landscape. However, when an outstanding resource or a strong tactical fit becomes available, IPG has been opportunistic in making tuck-in, niche acquisitions to enhance our offerings. Our focus has been and will continue to be predominantly on digital and international growth markets.

During the course of 2011, IPG acquired multiple agencies across the marketing spectrum, including firms specializing in digital and social media, healthcare communications, and public relations, as well as agencies with full service capabilities. All acquired agencies have been integrated into one of our global networks or existing agencies.

Financial Objectives

Our long-term financial goals include maintaining competitive organic revenue growth and continuing to improve our operating margins, which we expect will further strengthen our liquidity profile and increase value to our shareholders. Accordingly, we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure. We continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services, focusing on more effective resource utilization, including the productivity of our employees, real estate and information technology. The improvements we have made in our financial reporting and business information systems allow us more timely and actionable insights from our global operations, while our conservative approach to our balance sheet and liquidity position provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage our business.

We believe that our strategy and execution position us to be fully competitive in key growth areas such as digital services and emerging markets, with the talent and creativity to thrive in a content-driven media world, to meet our financial goals and to deliver long-term shareholder value.

Financial Reporting Segments

We have two reportable segments, which are Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”) and CMG. IAN is comprised of McCann, Draftfcb, Lowe, Mediabrands and our domestic integrated agencies. CMG is comprised of a number of our specialist marketing services offerings. We also report results for the “Corporate and other” group. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Principal Markets

Our agencies are located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. Our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below.

Sources of Revenue

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. Our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. As is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days.

Revenues for the creation, planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up. Many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement.

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services.

In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. Generally, we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges.

Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. Fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at December 31.

Clients

Our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world. Our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors. In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 22% and 24% of revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our largest client accounted for approximately 4% and 5% of revenue for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, our five largest clients (in alphabetical order) were General Motors, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Unilever and Verizon. We represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets, as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines, in each case through more than one of our agency systems. Representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations. Any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency, and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time.

We operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry. Our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships.

Personnel

As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 42,000 people, of whom approximately 18,000 were employed in the United States. Because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business, the quality of personnel

is of crucial importance to our continuing success. We conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies, and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention. There is keen competition for qualified employees.
