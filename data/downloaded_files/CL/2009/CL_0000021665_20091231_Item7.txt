ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

Executive Overview and Outlook 

Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. 

To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. 

Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. 

The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. 

On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth, gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s corporate governance practices (including the Company’s Code of Conduct) help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.

To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in emerging markets where economic development is likely to expand the markets for the Company’s products. 

The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 

The Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace and looking forward, expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. As disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, with approximately 75% of its Net sales generated outside of the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. 

Venezuela has been designated hyper-inflationary effective January 1, 2010. Consequently, the functional currency for the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary will be the U.S. dollar and the impact of all future Venezuelan currency fluctuations will be recorded in income. See “Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure—Foreign Exchange Risk” below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Also, on January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced its decision to devalue its currency and implement a two-tier exchange rate structure. As a result, the official exchange rate changed from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and 4.30 for non-essential goods. While we currently believe that many of our products may receive the 2.60 rate of exchange, we will remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary for 2010 and future periods at the rate at which we expect to remit dividends, which currently is 4.30. While difficult to project, our preliminary estimate is that the impact of the devaluation will be a net reduction in 2010 diluted earnings per share of between $0.06 and $0.10 per share. This includes the ongoing negative impact from foreign exchange translation, partially offset by one-time benefits from lower taxes on accrued but unpaid remittances and the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the devaluation date. As actual results may differ, please see “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” below. The Venezuelan government continues to impose currency exchange controls. We could be negatively affected if we are unable to obtain U.S. dollars at either of the official rates, in which case we may have to obtain dollars through transactions on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is less favorable. In 2009, our Venezuelan operations contributed 6% of consolidated net sales. 

Lower commodity and oil prices as compared with 2008 had a favorable impact on the Company’s results for 2009. The Company believes that this effect should continue in 2010 and, coupled with ongoing aggressive savings programs and favorable currency trends, should offset the impact of any pressures on selling prices or the costs of any consumption building programs that may be implemented to drive volume given the uncertain economic environment. However, continued difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s suppliers, customers and consumers which could, in turn, have an adverse impact on the Company’s business.

As a result of the Company’s four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program), which was finalized as of December 31, 2008, the Company streamlined its global supply chain, reallocated resources to enhance its sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Company’s other ongoing cost-savings and growth initiatives, are providing funds for investment in support of key categories and markets and new product development, while also supporting an increased level of profitability. 

The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long-term. 

Results of Operations 

Net Sales 

Worldwide Net sales were $15,327 in 2009, level with 2008 as volume growth of 0.5% and net selling price increases of 6.0% were offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 6.5%. Worldwide organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) grew 6.5% in 2009. 

Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $13,195 in 2009, level with 2008, as volume growth of 2.0% and net selling price increases of 5.5% were offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 7.5%. The 2008 divestment of a non-core brand in Germany impacted sales growth in 2009 by 0.5% versus 2008. Excluding the impact of this divestment, Net sales increased 0.5% in 2009 on volume growth of 2.5%. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment grew 8.0% in 2009. 

Net sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition were $2,132 in 2009, down 0.5% from 2008 as net selling price increases of 8.5% were more than offset by 7.5% volume declines and a 1.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. Organic sales in Hill’s Pet Nutrition grew 1.0% in 2009. 

Worldwide Net sales were $15,330 in 2008, up 11.0% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.0%.

Gross Profit 

Worldwide gross profit margin was 58.8% in 2009, 56.3% in 2008 and 56.2% in 2007. Restructuring and implementation-related charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $59 and $154, respectively. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 40 basis points (bps) and 110 bps in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin was 56.7% in 2008 and 57.3% in 2007. The gross profit increase in 2009 was driven by higher pricing and a continued focus on cost-savings programs, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact and costs related to the remeasurement of liabilities related to inventory purchases in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the decrease in 2008 was due to increases in raw and packaging material costs, partially offset by higher pricing and a continued focus on cost-savings programs. 

For additional information regarding the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During 2009, due to currency exchange control limitations in Venezuela, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary (CP Venezuela) settled certain of its U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities with dollars obtained through securities transactions in the parallel market at an exchange rate less favorable than the official rate. As a result, in the second half of 2009, CP Venezuela incurred $92 of higher costs related to the remeasurement of U.S. dollar liabilities to be settled with proceeds from these transactions, $65 of which is included in Gross profit for liabilities related to the purchase of inventory and $27 of which is included in Other (income) expense, net for all other liabilities. Additionally, in order to manage its overall currency exposure, CP Venezuela has purchased $210 of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by a Venezuelan state-owned corporation and $50 of U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 34.5% in 2009, 35.4% in 2008 and 36.1% in 2007. Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses are charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $81 (0.5% of Net sales) in 2008 and $49 (0.4% of Net sales) in 2007. The 90 bps decrease in 2009 was driven primarily by the absence of charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program in 2009, lower advertising costs (80 bps) and a continued focus on cost-savings programs, partially offset by higher pension and benefit costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales in 2008 decreased by 70 bps due to moderating levels of advertising investment (40 bps) and a continued focus on cost savings programs.

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rate was 32.2% in both 2009 and 2008, and 29.6% in 2007. The tax rate in all years benefited from global tax planning strategies. The 2007 effective tax rate reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $74 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $95 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and increases of 40 bps from the impact of the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. 

The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period depended on the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2008 and 2007 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 31.4% and 28.9%, respectively. 

For additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net Income 

Net income was $2,291, or $4.37 per share on a diluted basis in 2009 compared with $1,957, or $3.66 per share on a diluted basis in 2008 and $1,737 or $3.20 per share in 2007. Net income in 2008 included $113 ($0.21 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program. Net income in 2007 included a $30 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $74 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above, which were more than offset by $184 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program, $10 ($0.02 per share) of pension settlement charges and $8 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hill’s Pet Nutrition feline products. 

Segment Results 

The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. 

To conform to the current year presentation required by the Consolidation Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Codification, the amounts of Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly owned subsidiaries of $80 and $67 for years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, which were previously deducted from Greater Asia/Africa Operating profit, have been reclassified to a new line below Operating profit.

In 2008, the Operating profit increased 11% to $542 due to increased sales partially offset by higher agricultural commodities costs and higher advertising spending.

Like most major North American pet food producers, Hill’s Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s pet food recall in March 2007. Hill’s took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Company’s 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hill’s Pet Nutrition’s Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Net sales and volume growth, both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions, are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from ongoing operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. 

Worldwide Gross profit margin and Operating profit are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items (non-GAAP).

The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 

2004 Restructuring Program 

The Company’s 2004 Restructuring Program to enhance the Company’s global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008 and there were no charges incurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. The restructuring accrual decreased from $33 at December 31, 2008 to $15 at December 31, 2009, primarily due to cash payments for termination benefits, exit activities and the implementation of strategies. 

Charges incurred in connection with the implementation of various projects since inception were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Other charges primarily consisted of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $46 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $137 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. 

Total charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were as follows: North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (28%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (10%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (21%).

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Restructuring and implementation-related charges in the preceding table were recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions were centrally directed and controlled and were not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and the related accrual balances: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements amounting to $3 in 2008, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities.

Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that are taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Within Asset impairments, charges are net of gains realized on the sale of assets. 

During 2008, Other charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $5 and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $66. Start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were expensed as incurred. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including debt service, dividends, capital expenditures and planned stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash-generating capability and financial condition should continue to allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide.

Net cash provided by operations in 2009 was $3,277 as compared with $2,302 in 2008 and $2,252 in 2007. The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily related to improved profitability, decreased working capital and lower cash spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by higher tax payments. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 reflects the Company’s improved profitability, offset by increased working capital, higher tax payments and higher voluntary cash contributions to the Company’s U.S. postretirement benefit plans.

The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Overall, the Company’s working capital decreased to (0.4%) of Net sales in 2009 as compared with 2.5% in 2008. The decrease in working capital in 2009 is primarily related to improved accounts receivable days’ sales outstanding and decreased inventory days outstanding, while current liabilities including income taxes increased with our profitability. In 2008, higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales. Additionally, inventory and accounts payable and other accruals increased in 2008 as a result of raw material cost increases and inventory build-up for new product launches and promotional activities. 

Investing activities used $841 of cash during 2009 compared with uses of $613 and $528 during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Investing activities for 2009 included the purchase of $210 of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by a Venezuelan state-owned corporation and $50 of U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. The increase in use in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher capital spending and lower proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines, offset by lower payments for acquisitions.

Capital expenditures were $575, $684 and $583 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Lower capital expenditures in 2009 reflected the completion during the year of certain capacity expansions, as well as the completion of the 2004 Restructuring Program at the end of 2008. Capital spending continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to represent approximately 3.5% of Net sales. 

Investing activities in 2009 and 2008 included $17 and $58, respectively, of proceeds from the sale of certain assets, including certain asset sales in 2008 related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities in 2007 included $67 of net proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Latin American household bleach business and $43 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $27. 

Financing activities used $2,270 of cash during 2009 compared to $1,530 and $1,803 during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 was primarily due to higher net debt payments and an increase in dividends paid. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock. 

Long-term debt decreased to $3,147 as of December 31, 2009 as compared to $3,676 as of December 31, 2008 and total debt decreased to $3,182 as of December 31, 2009 as compared to $3,783 as of December 31, 2008. The Company’s long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,014 and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In August 2008, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its domestic revolving credit facility from $1,500 to $1,600 by adding two banks to the syndicate of banks participating in the revolving credit facility. The facility has an expiration date of November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support the issuance of commercial paper. 

During the third quarter of 2009, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.15% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were primarily used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, to effectively convert a portion of the Company’s fixed rate debt portfolio to a variable rate, the Company also entered into interest rate swaps, with a total notional value of $330. 

During 2008, the Company issued $250 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.2% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. The Company simultaneously entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the notes to a variable rate. During 2008, the Company also issued approximately $75 of forty-year notes at a variable rate, also under the shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay $100 of medium-term notes with an original maturity of May 2017 and to reduce commercial paper borrowings. 

During 2007, the Company issued 250 million of Euro-denominated medium-term notes maturing in June 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper.

Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $0 and $735 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2009 and 2008 were $1,144 and $1,284, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poor’s rating of A-1+ and a Moody’s Investors Service rating of P-1. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2012.

Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities. 

Dividend payments in 2009 were $981, an increase from $889 in 2008 and $798 in 2007. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.72 per share in 2009 from $1.56 per share in 2008 and $1.40 per share in 2007. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments increased to $13.76 per share in 2009 from $12.48 per share in 2008 and $11.20 per share in 2007. On February 4, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.53 per share, effective as of the second quarter 2010. 

The Effect of exchange rate changes on Cash and cash equivalents in 2009 primarily reflects the premium associated with acquiring U.S. dollar currency through parallel market transactions in Venezuela. 

The Company repurchases its shares of common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The repurchases are made pursuant to programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. Shares repurchased from January 30, 2008 through February 4, 2010 were repurchased pursuant to a program authorized by the Board on January 30, 2008 (the 2008 Program) and shares repurchased from March 9, 2006 to January 29, 2008 were repurchased pursuant to a program authorized by the Board on March 9, 2006 (the 2006 Program). On February 4, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2010 Program) which replaced the 2008 Program. The 2010 Program authorizes the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. 

Aggregate repurchases in 2009 included 13.9 million common shares under the 2008 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,063. Aggregate repurchases in 2008 included 13.8 million common shares under both the 2008 Program and the 2006 Program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,073. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 20.8 million common shares for a total purchase price of $1,269.

The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

____________  

  (1)   Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.    

  (2)   The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2009 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.    

  (3)   Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates,” below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2012. Management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2010, is approximately $120, including approximately $35 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $55 of projected contributions to the Company’s postretirement plans, comprised of $35 of voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plans and approximately $20 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans.   

Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 

Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure 

The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives for any purpose as well as derivatives for trading purposes. 

The sensitivity of our financial instruments to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign currency exposures reflect the Company’s operations in the markets in Latin America (28% of Net sales), Europe/South Pacific (21% of Net sales) and Asia/Africa (17% of Net sales). The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each segment. 

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. 

For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories, prepaids, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income. 

The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable forward rates. 

31 

Table of Contents   

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 

Our foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $4 at December 31, 2009 and net unrealized losses of $5 at December 31, 2008. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2009, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $17. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates. 

Based on year-end 2009 variable rate debt levels, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense, net by $10 in 2009. 

Commodity Price Risk 

The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities. 

Our open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized losses of $0 and $7 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At the end of 2009, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in an unrealized net loss of $1. 

Credit Risk 

The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely as it is the Company’s policy to contract with highly rated diverse counterparties. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

No new accounting pronouncement issued or which became effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. 

      •   Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 730 bps, from 58.8% to 51.5%, in 2009 and decreased by 780 and 790 bps in 2008 and 2007, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.    

      •   The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 79% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 21% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2009, 2008 and 2007 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.   

The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies. 

      •   In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.75%, 6.30% and 6.50% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The discount rate for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.75%, 5.80% and 6.50% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, an expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return.    

33 

Table of Contents   

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 

Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 17%, 5%, 4%, 6%, and 9%, respectively. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans. 

      •   The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 9.00% for 2010, declining to 5.00% by 2016 and remaining at 5.00% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by $5.    

      •   The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12.06. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 9%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 5%.    

      •   The asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets.    

      •   The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement.    

      •   Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.

      •   Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.    

The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.
