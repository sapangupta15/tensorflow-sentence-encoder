Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2011 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 The challenging global economic environment continues to provide headwinds for our business. This results in pricing pressures across our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions operating segments. We continue to operate in a soft insurance pricing market. As property and casualty rates continue to moderate, the level of exposure units, or volume, appears to be stabilizing. Exposure units have been negatively impacted by the global economy, which places pressure on our business in three primary ways:   

declining insurable risks due to decreasing asset values, including property values, payroll, number of active employees, and corporate revenues,  

client cost-driven behavior, where clients are actively looking to reduce spending in order to meet budget reductions, and increase risk retention, as a result of prioritizing their total spending, and  

sector specific weakness, including financial services, construction, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions, all of which have been particularly impacted by the current economic downturn.   

 Our revenue for 2011 increased as a result of acquisitions, including Hewitt in October 2010, and new products and services, such as GRIP Solutions. We also continue to demonstrate expense discipline, while we invest in our businesses.  

 We focus on three key metrics that we communicate to shareholders: grow organically, expand margins, and increase earnings per share. The following is our measure of performance against these three metrics for 2011:   

Organic revenue growth, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was 2% in 2011, demonstrating continued improvement compared to the prior year's flat organic revenue.  

Adjusted operating margin, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was 15.8% for Aon overall, 19.9% for the Risk Solutions segment, and 13.0% for the HR Solutions segment. Adjusted operating margins declined across the Risk Solutions segment, the HR Solutions segment and for the Company overall.  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Aon stockholders, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was $3.29 per share in 2011, an increase from $3.12 per share, or 5%, in 2010, demonstrating solid operational performance and effective capital management despite a difficult business environment.   

Additionally, the following is a summary of our 2011 financial results:   

Revenue increased $2.8 billion, or 33%, to $11.3 billion due primarily to an increase from acquisitions, primarily Hewitt in October 2010 and Glenrand MIB Limited ("Glenrand") in 2011, net of dispositions, 2% organic revenue growth and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth was 2% in the Risk Solutions segment and flat in the HR Solutions segment.  

Operating expenses increased $2.4 billion from the prior year to $9.7 billion, primarily as a result of the inclusion of expenses from the Hewitt and Glenrand acquisitions, including higher intangible asset amortization expense, $18 million of non-cash charges related to the write-off of accounts receivable primarily from prior years, and unfavorable foreign currency translation offset by a $59 million decline in restructuring charges and realization of benefits from   

40 

restructuring initiatives. In addition, 2010 included a $49 million expense related to the 2010 non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets and a $9 million expense related to the anti-bribery and compliance charge.    

Our consolidated operating margin from continuing operations for the year on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis was 14.2% in 2011, essentially flat when compared to 2010.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to Aon stockholders increased $242 million, or 33%, from $733 million in 2010 to $975 million in 2011, primarily related to the inclusion of Hewitt.   

 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

 General  

 In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and the impact of foreign exchange rates on operating results.  

 Organic Revenue  

 We use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items. Supplemental information related to organic growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages to the reported Commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages, has been provided in the "Review by Segment" caption, below.  

 Adjusted Operating Margins  

 We use adjusted operating margin as a measure of core operating performance of our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions segments. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of restructuring charges, the legacy receivables write-off, Hewitt related integration costs, and transaction costs related to the proxy statement filed in connection with our potential relocation of our headquarters to London. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated  

41 

Financial Statements. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported operating margin is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1)Includes unallocated expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenue.   

 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  

 We also use adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as a measure of Aon's core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of restructuring charges, the legacy receivables write-off, Hewitt related integration costs, and transaction costs related to the UK reincorporation, along with related income taxes. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions except per share data):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations  

 Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our  

42 

operations, we have provided a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating last year's revenue, expenses and net income at this year's foreign exchange rates.  

 Summary of Results  

 The consolidated results of continuing operations are as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consolidated Results for 2011 Compared to 2010  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $2.8 billion, or 33%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase principally reflects a $2.4 billion, or 113%, increase in the HR Solutions segment, and a $394 million, or 6%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment. The 113% increase in the HR Solutions segment was principally driven by acquisitions, primarily Hewitt in October 2010, net of dispositions, and a 2% positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates with flat organic revenue growth. The 6% increase in the Risk Solutions segment was primarily driven by a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, a 2% increase in organic revenue growth reflecting the growth in both the Americas and International regions and a 1% increase from acquisitions, primarily Glenrand in April 2011, net of dispositions.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased $1.5 billion, or 29%, when compared to 2010. The increase reflects a $1.3 billion, or 101%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $161 million, or 4%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment. In total, the increase for the year was driven by the impact of the Hewitt and Glenrand acquisitions and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates,  

43 

partially offset by the realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives. In addition, 2010 included a $49 million non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets.  

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses increased by $925 million, or 42%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase reflects a $852 million, or 152%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $113 million, or 7%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment partially offset by a $46 million decrease in unallocated expenses. The overall increase was due largely to the impact of the Hewitt and Glenrand acquisitions, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses and intangible amortization, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. These increased costs were partially offset by lower restructuring charges and restructuring savings and operational expense management.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income increased $3 million, or 20%, from 2010, due to higher levels of interest bearing assets.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $63 million, or 35%, from 2010 due to an increase in the amount of debt outstanding for the full year primarily related to the Hewitt acquisition. Additionally, 2010 included charges of $14 million attributable to a $1.5 billion Bridge Loan Facility that was put in place to finance the Hewitt acquisition, but was cancelled following the issuance of the notes.  

 Other Income  

 Other income of $5 million in 2011 includes death benefits on certain Company owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses and write-offs related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds and other long-term investments and a $19 million loss on the extinguishment of debt. Additionally, 2010 included a loss of $8 million on extinguishment of debt and losses related to certain long-term investments, partially offset by gains related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.4 billion, a 31% increase from $1.1 billion in 2010. The increase in income was driven by the 2% increase in organic growth, the inclusion of Hewitt's and Glenrand's operating results, lower costs and increased benefits from restructuring initiatives and operational improvement, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.  

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.3% in 2011 and 28.4% in 2010. The 2011 rate reflects the release of a valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits offset partially by net unfavorable deferred tax adjustments in non-US jurisdictions including the impact of a UK tax rate change. The 2010 rate reflects the impact of the Hewitt acquisition in the fourth quarter, the favorable effect of a U.S. pension expense adjustment, which had a tax rate of 40%, and deferred tax adjustments. The underlying tax rate for continuing operations was 27.3% in 2011 and is estimated to be approximately 29.0% for 2012.  

44 

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations increased to $1.0 billion ($2.86 diluted net income per share) in 2011 from $759 million ($2.46 diluted net income per share) in 2010. Currency fluctuations positively impacted income from continuing operations in 2011 by $0.04 per diluted share, when the 2010 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2011 foreign exchange rates.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 In 2011, after-tax income from discontinued operations of $4 million ($0.01 diluted net income per share) was recorded compared to after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $27 million ($0.09 diluted net loss per share) in 2010. The loss in 2010 was driven by the settlement of legacy litigation related to the Buckner vs. Resource Life case.  

 Consolidated Results for 2010 Compared to 2009  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $917 million, or 12%, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase principally reflects an $844 million, or 67%, increase in the HR Solutions segment, a $118 million, or 2%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment, partially offset by a $49 million decline in unallocated revenue. The 67% increase in the HR Solutions segment was principally driven by acquisitions, primarily Hewitt, net of dispositions, 1% organic revenue growth, and a 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation. The 2% increase in the Risk Solutions segment was primarily driven by a 1% increase from acquisitions, primarily Allied North America, net of dispositions, and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth was flat, an improvement from the declines experienced in the prior year, as a result of global economic conditions slowly improving. A $19 million decline in fiduciary investment income was due to a decline in global interest rates. In 2009, $49 million in unallocated revenue was related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds acquired with Benfield. In 2010, this investment is no longer consolidated in our financial statements.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased $500 million, or 11%, over 2009. The increase reflects a $562 million, or 75%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $51 million increase in unallocated expenses, which was partially offset by a $113 million, or 3%, decrease in the Risk Solutions segment. In total, the increase for the year was driven by the inclusion of Hewitt's operating expenses from the date of the acquisition, a net pension curtailment gain recognized in 2009 of $78 million related to our U.S. and Canada defined benefit pension plans, a $49 million non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense recognized in 2010 resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets, and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower restructuring costs, restructuring savings and other operational improvements.  

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses increased by $212 million, or 11%, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase reflects a $251 million, or 81%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $24 million increase in unallocated expenses, which was partially offset by a $63 million, or 4%, decrease in the Risk Solutions segment. The overall increase was due largely to the impact of the Hewitt acquisition, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses and intangible amortization from the acquisition date; higher E&O expenses as a result of the higher level of insurance recoveries in the prior year; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation; costs associated with the Manchester United Sponsorship, which commenced during the year; and other Hewitt related transaction and integration  

45 

costs. These increased costs were partially offset by lower restructuring charges, restructuring savings, operational expense management, and Benfield integration costs in 2009.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income decreased $1 million, or 6%, from 2009, due to lower global interest rates.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $60 million, or 49%, from 2009 due mainly to an increase in the amount of debt outstanding related to the Hewitt acquisition, including $1.5 billion in notes and a $1.0 billion term loan, and $14 million in deferred financing costs attributable to a $1.5 billion Bridge Loan Facility that was put in place to finance the Hewitt acquisition, but was cancelled following the issuance of the notes.  

 Other Income  

 There was no Other income in 2010 versus $34 million in 2009. This decrease is primarily due to $4 million in losses in 2010 compared to $13 million in gains in 2009 related to the disposal of several small businesses, an $8 million loss related to the early extinguishment of debt primarily acquired in the Hewitt acquisition in 2010, and a $5 million gain in 2009 from the extinguishment of $15 million of junior subordinated debentures.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.1 billion, a 12% increase from $949 million in 2009. The increase in income was driven by the inclusion of Hewitt's operating results from the date of the acquisition, lower costs and increased benefits from restructuring initiatives, favorable foreign currency translation and operational improvement, which was partially offset by the pension curtailment gain recognized last year, Hewitt related transaction and integration costs, the 2010 pension adjustment related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and costs related to the Manchester United sponsorship.  

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.4% in 2010 and 28.2% in 2009. The 2010 rate reflects the impact of the Hewitt acquisition in the fourth quarter, a favorable U.S. pension expense adjustment, which had a tax rate of 40%, and deferred tax adjustments. The 2009 tax rate was negatively impacted by a non-cash deferred tax expense on the U.S. pension curtailment gain, which had a tax rate of 40%. The underlying tax rate for continuing operations was 28.5% in 2010 and is estimated to be approximately 30% for 2011, reflecting changes in geographical mix of income following the Hewitt acquisition.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations increased to $759 million ($2.46 diluted net income per share) in 2010 from $681 million ($2.19 diluted net income per share) in 2009. Currency fluctuations positively impacted income from continuing operations in 2010 by $0.11 per diluted share, when the 2009 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2010 foreign exchange rates.  

46 

 Discontinued Operations  

 In 2010, an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $27 million ($0.09 diluted net loss per share) was recorded compared to after-tax income from discontinued operations of $111 million ($0.38 diluted net income per share) in 2009. The loss in 2010 was driven by the settlement of legacy litigation related to the Buckner vs. Resource Life case. The 2009 results include the recognition of a $55 million foreign tax carryback related to the sale of CICA, a $43 million after-tax gain on the sale of AIS and a curtailment gain on the post-retirement benefit plan related to the CICA disposal.  

 Restructuring Initiatives  

 Aon Hewitt Restructuring Plan  

 On October 14, 2010, we announced a global restructuring plan (the "Aon Hewitt Plan") in connection with our acquisition of Hewitt. The Aon Hewitt Plan, which will continue into 2013, is intended to streamline operations across the combined Aon Hewitt organization. The restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $325 million through the end of the plan, consisting of approximately $180 million in employee termination costs and approximately $145 million in real estate lease rationalization costs. An estimated 1,500 to 1,800 positions globally, predominately non-client facing, are expected to be eliminated as part of the plan.  

 As of December 31, 2011, approximately 1,080 jobs have been eliminated under the Aon Hewitt Plan and total expenses of $157 million have been incurred. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 The following summarizes the restructuring and related costs, by type, that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Hewitt Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions that may change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause the Company to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.

 The following summarizes the restructuring and related expenses by segment that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Hewitt Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The restructuring plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver approximately $280 million of annual savings in 2013, of which, approximately $20 million will be achieved in the Risk Solution segment. We expect to achieve approximately $355 million in annual cost savings across the Company in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to the restructuring plan, and additional savings in areas such as information technology, procurement and public company costs. All of the components of the restructuring and integration plan are not finalized and actual total savings, costs and timing may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the plan. We estimate that we realized approximately $137 million and $4 million of cost savings before any reinvestment in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately $136 million and $1 million of the cost savings before reinvestment in 2011 was realized in the HR Solutions Segment and Risk Solutions Segment, respectively.  

 Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan  

 We announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with our 2008 acquisition of Benfield. The restructuring plan is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 800 job eliminations. Additionally, duplicate space and assets will be abandoned. We originally estimated that this plan would result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, of which $104 million was recorded as part of the Benfield purchase price allocation and $81 million of which was expected to result in future charges to earnings. During 2009, we reduced the Benfield purchase price allocation by $49 million to reflect actual severance costs being lower than originally estimated. We currently estimate the Aon Benfield Plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $160 million, of which $53 million was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation, $19 million, $26 million, and $55 million have been recorded in earnings during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and an estimated additional $7 million will be recorded in future earnings. The plan was closed in January 2012.  

 As of December 31, 2011, approximately 785 jobs have been eliminated under the Aon Benfield Plan. Total payments of $129 million have been made under this plan to date.

 The following is a summary of the restructuring and related expenses by type that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Benfield Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions that may change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause us to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.   

 All costs associated with the Aon Benfield Plan are included in the Risk Solutions segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These restructuring activities and related expenses were concluded in January.  

 The Aon Benfield Plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver cumulative cost savings of approximately $144 million in 2012. We estimate that we realized approximately $122 million, and $100 million, of cost savings in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The actual savings, total costs and timing of the restructuring plan may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions of the plan, and foreign exchange rates.  

 2007 Restructuring Plan  

 In 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth to better serve clients (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan resulted in approximately 4,700 job eliminations and we have closed or consolidated several offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. The total cumulative pretax charges for the 2007 Plan were $737 million. We do not expect any further expenses to be incurred in the 2007 Plan. Costs related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 We estimate that we realized cost savings, before any reinvestment of savings, of approximately $536 million and $476 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  

 Liquidity  

 Executive Summary  

 Our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with financial flexibility to create long-term value for our stockholders. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, restructuring payments, funding pension obligations and the payment of stockholder dividends.  

 Cash and short-term investments decreased $74 million to $1.1 billion in 2011. Our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. During 2011, cash flow from operating activities, excluding client held funds, increased $235 million to $1.0 billion. Uses of funds in 2011 included an increase in receivables of $494 million, primarily related to a temporary delay in invoicing HR Solutions' customers. This increase in unbilled receivables resulted in a temporary decrease in cash collections in 2011. We expect this temporary increase in unbilled receivables and the resulting decrease in operating cash flow to reverse and return to normalized levels in the first half of 2012. Additional uses of funds included $399 million in cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans in excess of pension expense, capital expenditures of $241 million, dividends paid to shareholders of $200 million, and share repurchases of $828 million. These amounts were offset by net income of $1.0 billion and non-cash charges primarily related to depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation expense of $957 million.  

 Our investment grade rating is important to us for a number of reasons, the most important of which is preserving our financial flexibility. If our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, the interest expense on any outstanding balances on our credit facilities would increase and we could incur additional requests for pension contributions. To manage unforeseen situations, we have  

50 

committed credit lines of approximately $1.3 billion and we manage our business to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings.  

 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities  

 Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased $235 million to $1.0 billion as compared to $783 million in 2010. The primary contributors to cash flow from operations were net income of $1.0 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $957 million, primarily related to depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense. These items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $484 million, primarily related to a temporary delay in invoicing HR Solutions' customers of approximately $300 million. This increase in unbilled receivables resulted in a temporary decrease in cash collections in 2011. We expect this temporary increase in unbilled receivables and the resulting decrease in operating cash flow to reverse and return to normalized levels in the first half of 2012. Additional uses of cash include $399 million cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans in excess of pension expense. Pension contributions during 2011 were $477 million as compared to $288 million in 2010. In 2012, we expect to contribute $541 million to our major defined benefit plans, with a modest decrease in pension expense. In 2012, we also expect to have cash payments related to restructuring plans of $143 million  

 Cash Flows Used For Investing Activities  

 Cash used for investing activities in 2011 was $186 million. Acquisitions used $106 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Glenrand. Net purchases of non-fiduciary short-term investments used $8 million, and capital expenditures used $241 million. The sale of businesses provided $9 million, consisting of proceeds from several small dispositions, and sales, net of purchases, of long-term investments provided $160 million.  

 Cash used for investing activities in 2010 was $2.1 billion. Acquisitions used $2.0 billion, primarily related to the acquisition of Hewitt. Net purchases of non-fiduciary short-term investments used $337 million, and capital expenditures used $180 million. The sale of businesses used $30 million, consisting of proceeds from several small dispositions which were more than offset by a $38 million use of cash for a litigation settlement related to a previously disposed of business. Sales, net of purchases, of long-term investments provided $56 million.  

 Cash used for investing activities was $229 million in 2009, primarily comprised of $274 million paid to acquire 14 businesses, including Allied North America and FCC Global Insurance Services, $85 million paid to purchase, net of sales, long-term investments, and $140 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $259 million of net proceeds from the sales of non-fiduciary short-term investments.  

 Cash Flows Used For Financing Activities  

 Cash used for financing activities during 2011 was $896 million. Share repurchases were $828 million and dividends to shareholders were $200 million. Dividends paid to, and purchase of shares from non-controlling interests were $54 million. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through employee stock purchase plans were $201 million.  

 Cash provided by financing activities during 2010 was $1.8 billion. During 2010 we received $2.9 billion from the issuance of debt, primarily a $600 million 3.5% note due in 2015, a $600 million 5% note due in 2020, a $300 million 6.25% note due 2040, and a $1 billion three-year term note due in 2013, all associated with the acquisition of Hewitt. Additionally, we borrowed $308 million from our Euro credit facility and $100 million of commercial paper during the year, which were repaid as of year end. We also repaid $299 million of debt assumed in the Hewitt acquisition. Other uses of cash include $250 million for share repurchases and $175 million for dividends to shareholders. Proceeds from the  

51 

exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan were $194 million.  

 Cash used for financing activities in 2009 was $649 million. We purchased $590 million of treasury shares, and received $163 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan. During 2009, we issued €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures. These funds were primarily used to pay off our Euro credit facility borrowings. We also used $100 million for the repayment of short-term debt related to a variable interest entity ("VIE") for which we were the primary beneficiary. Cash dividends of $165 million were paid to shareholders.  

 Cash and Investments  

 At December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.1 billion, essentially flat against the balance of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010. Of the total balance recorded at December 31, 2011, approximately $191 million was restricted as to its use as compared to $60 million as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, $337 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and $720 million were held by our subsidiaries in other countries. At December 31, 2010, $521 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and $610 million were held by our subsidiaries in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S., if repatriated, could have an unfavorable tax impact.  

 In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly, primarily depending on when we collect the premiums, claims and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are required to be invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of $4.2 billion and fiduciary receivables of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2011. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments are not owned by us, and cannot be used for general corporate purposes.  

 As disclosed in Note 15 "Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our short-term investments carried at fair value are money market funds. Money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Based on market convention, we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We do not believe that there are any significant market liquidity issues affecting the fair value of these investments.  

 As of December 31, 2011, our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of $2.4 billion and are included in Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature and initial maturity.

 Share Repurchase Program  

 In the fourth quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors increased the authorized share repurchase program to $4.6 billion. As of March 31, 2011, this program was fully utilized upon the repurchase of 118.7 million shares of common stock at an average price (excluding commissions) of $40.97 per share in the first quarter 2011, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.6 billion since inception of this stock repurchase program.  

 In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which up to $2 billion of common stock may be repurchased from time to time depending on market conditions or other factors through open market or privately negotiated transactions. In 2011, we repurchased 16.4 million shares through this program through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at an average price (excluding commissions) of $50.39 per share. The remaining authorized amount for stock purchase under the 2010 program is $1.2 billion. Shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured repurchase programs.  

 For information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2011, see Item 5  "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" as previously described.  

 Shelf Registration Statement  

 On June 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt, preferred stock, common stock and convertible securities. Our $1.5 billion in unsecured notes, sold on September 7, 2010 to finance the Hewitt acquisition and our offer and sale of $500 million in unsecured notes on May 24, 2011 to partially refinance our three-year 2010 Term Loan Facility entered into in connection with the Hewitt acquisition were each issued under this registration statement. The availability of any further potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. There can be no assurance regarding when, or if, we will issue any additional securities under the registration statement.  

53 

 Credit Facilities  

 We have a three-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. ("U.S. Facility"). Sixteen banks are participating in the U.S. Facility, which is for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support. Additionally, we have a five-year €650 million ($849 million at December 31, 2011 exchange rates) multi-currency foreign credit facility ("Euro Facility") available, which was entered into in October 2010 and expires in October 2015. The Euro Facility replaces a € 650 million multi-currency revolving loan credit facility that was entered into in 2005 and expired in October 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings under either of the credit facilities.  

 For both our U.S. and Euro Facilities, the two most significant covenants require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted for Hewitt related transaction costs and up to $50 million in non-recurring cash charges ("Adjusted EBITDA") to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. We were in compliance with these and all other covenants at December 31, 2011.  

 Rating Agency Ratings  

 The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 24, 2012 appear in the table below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether.  

 Letters of Credit  

 We have outstanding letters of credit ("LOCs") totaling $75 million at December 31, 2011 as compared to $71 million at December 31, 2010. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to our Canadian pension plan scheme, cover deductible retentions for our workers compensation program, secure a sublease agreement for office space, secure one of our U.S. pension plans, and cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties.  

 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources  

 We believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditures, pension contributions, cash restructuring costs, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1, "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors."  

54 

 Contractual Obligations  

 Summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. 

(2)In 2007, our principal U.K subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £9.4 million ($15 million) per year to that pension plan for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by approximately 5% on each April 1. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2011, the estimated winding-up deficit was £390 million ($610 million). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid. 

(3)Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including what is to be purchased, at what price and the approximate timing of the transaction. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or for claims outsourcing in the U.K. 

(4)Excludes $75 million of unfunded commitments related to an investment in a limited partnership due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when the limited partnership will request funding. 

(5)Excludes $118 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements will be made.   

 Financial Condition  

 At December 31, 2011, our net assets of $8.1 billion, representing total assets minus total liabilities, were $186 million lower than the balance at December 31, 2010. Working capital increased $175 million to $1.7 billion.  

55 

 Balance sheet categories that reflected large variances from last year included the following:   

Cash and short-term investments decreased $74 million, resulting primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of $494 million, $399 million in cash contributions to major deferred benefit plans in excess of pension expense and capital expenditures of $241 million, offset by net income of $1.0 billion.  

Total Receivables increased $494 million primarily related to a temporary delay in invoicing HR Solutions' customers. This increase in unbilled receivables resulted in a temporary decrease in cash collections in 2011 of approximately $300 million. We expect this temporary increase in unbilled receivables and the resulting decrease in operating cash flow to reverse and return to normalized levels in the first half of 2012.  

Goodwill and other intangibles decreased $212 million due primarily to amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by goodwill recognized from acquisitions.   

 Borrowings  

 Total debt at December 31, 2011 was $4.5 billion, a decrease of $14 million from December 31, 2010, essentially flat when compared to the prior year (see Note 8 "Debt").  

 On May 24, 2011, we entered into an underwriting agreement for the sale of $500 million of 3.125% unsecured Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"). On June 15, 2011, we entered into a Term Credit Agreement for unsecured term loan financing of $450 million ("2011 Term Loan Facility") due on October 1, 2013. The 2011 Term Loan Facility is a variable rate loan that is based on LIBOR plus a margin and at December 31, 2011, the effective annualized rate was approximately 1.67%. We used the net proceeds from the Notes issuance and 2011 Term Loan Facility borrowings to repay all amounts outstanding under our $1.0 billion three-year credit agreement dated August 13, 2010 ("2010 Term Loan Facility"), which was entered into in connection with the acquisition of Hewitt. We recorded a $19 million loss on the extinguishment of the 2010 Term Loan Facility as a result of the write-off of the deferred financing costs, which is included in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 On March 8, 2011, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon issued CAD 375 million ($368 at December 31, 2011 exchange rates) of 4.76% senior unsecured debt securities, which we have guaranteed and are due in March 2018. We used the net proceeds from this issuance to repay its CAD 375 million 5.05% debt securities upon their maturity on April 12, 2011.  

 Our total debt as a percentage of total capital attributable to Aon stockholders was 35.8% and 35.3% at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  

 Equity  

 Equity at December 31, 2011 was $8.1 billion, a decrease of $186 million from December 31, 2010. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock due to share repurchases of $828 million, $200 million of dividends to shareholders, and an increase in Accumulated other comprehensive income of $453 million, offset by net income of $1.0 billion and stock compensation expense of $235 million.  

 Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $453 million since December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting the following:   

a decline in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $44 million, which was attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies;  

an increase of $396 million in the net underfunded position of our post-retirement benefit obligations due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the future benefit obligation; and   

56 

net derivative losses of $13 million.   

 REVIEW BY SEGMENT  

 General  

 We serve clients through the following segments:   

Risk Solutions acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, via consultation, as well as negotiation and placement of insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.  

HR Solutions partners with organizations to solve their most complex benefits, talent and related financial challenges, and improve business performance by designing, implementing, communicating and administering a wide range of human capital, retirement, investment management, health care, compensation and talent management strategies.   

 Risk Solutions  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. During 2011 we began to see some improvement in pricing; however, we would still consider this to be a "soft market," which began in 2007. In a soft market, premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds. In 2011, pricing showed signs of stabilization and improvement in both our retail and reinsurance brokerage product lines and we expect this trend to slowly continue into 2012.  

 Additionally, beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2011, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. Weak global economic conditions have reduced our customers' demand for our brokerage products, which have had a negative impact on our operational results.  

 Risk Solutions generated approximately 60% of our consolidated total revenues in 2011. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients' policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.  

 We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, health care providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability  

57 

income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide products and services via GRIP Solutions; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide risk consulting, actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.  

 Revenue  

 Risk Solutions commissions, fees and other revenue were as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In 2011, commissions, fees and other revenue increased $397 million, or 6%, from 2010 driven primarily by the 3% favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, 2% increase in organic revenue growth and a 1% increase from acquisitions, primarily Glenrand, net of dispositions.  

 Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other revenue growth for 2011 versus 2010 is as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Retail brokerage Commissions, fees and other revenue increased 8% driven by a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, 3% growth in organic revenue in both the Americas and International operations, and a 2% increase related to acquisitions, net of dispositions.  

 Americas Commissions, fees and other revenue increased 10% reflecting the 6% impact of acquisitions, net of dispositions, 3% organic revenue growth driven by strong growth in Latin America and continued strength in the Affinity business and 1% impact from favorable foreign currency exchange rates.  

 International commissions, fees and other revenue improved 6% driven by a 4% impact from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a 3% organic revenue increase reflecting growth in Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Africa partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from dispositions, net of acquisitions.  

58 

 Reinsurance commissions, fees and other revenue increased 1% driven by a favorable foreign currency translation of 2% and was partially offset by a 1% decline in dispositions, net of acquisitions and other. Organic revenue was flat primarily resulting from strong growth in the capital market transactions and advisory business, partially offset by declines in global facultative placements.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased $120 million, or 10%, from 2010 to $1.3 billion in 2011. In 2011, operating income margins in this segment were 19.3%, up 70 basis points from 18.6% in 2010. Operating margin improvement was primarily driven by revenue growth, reduced costs of restructuring initiatives and realization of the benefits of those restructuring plans, which was partially offset by the negative impact of expense increases related to investment in the business, lease termination costs, legacy receivables write-off, and foreign currency exchange rates.  

 HR Solutions  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of Hewitt, one of the world's leading human resource consulting and outsourcing companies. Hewitt operates globally together with Aon's existing consulting and outsourcing operations under the newly created Aon Hewitt brand. Hewitt's operating results are included in Aon's results of operations beginning October 1, 2010.  

 Our HR Solutions segment generated approximately 40% of our consolidated total revenues in 2011 and provides a broad range of human capital services, as follows:   

Health and Benefits advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs that attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence management, benefits administration, data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory and elective benefits services. Effective January 1, 2012, this line of business will be included in the results of the Risk Solutions segment.  

Retirement specializes in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration.  

Compensation focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.  

Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change management.  

Benefits Administration applies our HR expertise primarily through defined benefit (pension), defined contribution (401(k)), and health and welfare administrative services. Our model replaces the resource-intensive processes once required to administer benefit plans with more efficient, effective, and less costly solutions.  

Human Resource Business Processing Outsourcing ("HR BPO") provides market-leading solutions to manage employee data; administer benefits, payroll and other human resources processes; and   

59 

record and manage talent, workforce and other core HR process transactions as well as other complementary services such as absence management, flexible spending, dependent audit and participant advocacy.    

 Beginning in late 2008, the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets created significant uncertainty in the marketplace. Weak economic conditions globally continued throughout 2011. The prolonged economic downturn is adversely impacting our clients' financial condition and therefore the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. While we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time, these challenges are reducing demand for some of our services and putting continued pressure on pricing of those services, which is having an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.  

 Revenue  

 In 2011, Commissions, fees and other revenue of $4.5 billion was 113% higher than 2010, reflecting the impact of the Hewitt acquisition. Commissions, fees and other revenue were as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Organic revenue growth was flat in 2011, as detailed in the following reconciliation:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consulting services increased $864 million or 62%, due primarily to the Hewitt acquisition, 2% favorable foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth of 1%, driven by growth in global compensation, investment management consulting offset by declines in retirement.  

 Outsourcing revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 211%, due primarily to the Hewitt acquisition. There was no material impact from foreign currency exchange rates, and organic revenue growth was flat as new client wins in HR business process outsourcing and Navigators health care exchanges were partially offset by price compression and client losses in benefits administration.  

60 

 Operating Income  

 Operating income was $448 million, an increase of $214 million, or 91%, from 2010. This increase was principally driven by the inclusion of Hewitt's operating results. Margins in this segment for 2011 were 10.0%, a decrease of 110 basis points from 11.1% in 2010 driven by the impact of higher intangible amortization expense related to the acquisition of Hewitt, higher restructuring costs and increases in Hewitt related costs partially offset by the realization of the benefits of those restructuring plans and operational improvement.  

 Unallocated Income and Expense  

 A reconciliation of our operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments. Net unallocated expenses declined $46 million to $156 million from $202 million in 2010, driven primarily by the $49 million one-time pension expense included in the 2010 expense and declines of $21 million in Hewitt related costs partially offset by a $3 million increase in expense associated with the potential relocation of the Company's headquarters to London.  

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income increased $3 million, or 20%, from 2010, due to higher levels of interest bearing assets.  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $63 million, or 35%, from 2010 due to an increase in the amount of debt outstanding related to the Hewitt acquisition. 2010 included $14 million in deferred financing costs attributable to a $1.5 billion Bridge Loan Facility that was put in place to finance the Hewitt acquisition, but was cancelled following the issuance of the notes.  

 Other income of $5 million in 2011 includes a favorable mark-to-market gain on certain company owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds and other long-term investments and a $19 million loss on the extinguishment of debt in 2011. Additionally, 2010 included a loss of $8 million on extinguishment of debt and losses related to certain long-term investments, partially offset by gains related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of  

61 

the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  

 In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Revenue Recognition  

 Risk Solutions segment revenues include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable. The Company generally considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client, there is a fixed or determinable price, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured. For brokerage commissions, revenue is typically considered to be earned and realized or realizable at the completion of the placement process. Commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the Company has sufficient information to conclude the amount due is determinable, which may not occur until cash is received from the insurance carrier. In instances when commissions relate to policy premiums that are billed in installments, revenue is recognized when the Company has sufficient information to determine the appropriate billing and the associated commission. Fees for services provided to clients are generally recognized ratably over the period that the services are rendered. Investment income is recognized as it is earned and realized or realizable.  

 HR Solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts. Fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed. Revenues from fixed-fee contracts are generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues. The Company's outsourcing contracts typically have three-to-five year terms for benefits services and five-to-ten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing ('HR BPO') services. The Company recognizes revenues as services are performed. The Company also receives implementation fees from clients either up-front or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant. Lump sum implementation fees received from a client are initially deferred and generally recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period. If a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract, a loss on the contract may be recorded, if necessary, and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would then be recognized into earnings over the remaining service period through the termination date. Services provided outside the scope of the Company's outsourcing contracts are recognized on a time-and-material or fixed-fee basis.  

 In connection with the Company's long-term outsourcing service agreements, highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the Company's systems and operating processes. For outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting, specific, incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are generally deferred and amortized over the  

62 

period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized. Such costs may include internal and external costs for coding or customizing systems, costs for conversion of client data and costs to negotiate contract terms. For outsourcing services that are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting, specific, incremental and direct costs of implementation, as well as ongoing service delivery costs incurred prior to revenue recognition commencing, are deferred and amortized over the remaining contract services period. Contracts are assessed periodically to determine if they are onerous, in which case a loss is recognized in the current period. Deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis, to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue.  

 Restructuring  

 Workforce reduction costs  

 The method used to recognize workforce reduction costs depends on whether the benefits are provided under a one-time benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement. We account for relevant expenses as an ongoing benefit arrangement when we have an established termination benefit policy, statutory requirements dictate the termination benefit amounts, or we have an established pattern of providing similar termination benefits. The method to estimate the amount of termination benefits is based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated.  

 We recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from an ongoing benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated and notify the employees.  

 We recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from a one-time benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees receive incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we recognize the cost of their termination benefits over the remaining service period.  

 Lease termination costs  

 Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss and corresponding liability. The liability reflects our best estimate of the fair value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss and corresponding liability, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties.  

 Useful lives on leasehold improvements or other assets associated with lease abandonments may be revised to reflect a shorter useful life than originally estimated, which results in accelerated depreciation.  

 Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses  

 Accounting guidance requires that the liabilities recorded related to our restructuring activities be measured at fair value.  

 Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their present value. Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time and therefore no discounting is necessary. However, we may discount the termination benefit arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.  

63 

 Other associated costs with restructuring activities  

 We recognize other costs associated with restructuring activities as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.  

 Pensions  

 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada.  

 Significant changes to pension plans  

 Our U.S., U.K. and Canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants. In 2007, future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in our U.K. plans. Effective April 1, 2009, we ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our two U.S. plans. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain of $83 million in 2009. In 2010, we ceased crediting future benefits relating to service in our Canadian defined benefit pension plans. We recognized a curtailment loss of $5 million related to the Canadian pension plans in 2009.  

 Recognition of gains and losses and prior service  

 We defer the recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and plan asset performance.  

 Unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the Netherlands and Canada, or the average life expectancy of the U.S. and U.K. plan members. After the effective date of the plan amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service, unrecognized gains and losses are also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the Canadian plans. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.  

 As of December 31, 2011, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.  

 The following table discloses our combined experience loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2012 amortization of loss by country (amounts in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The unrecognized prior service cost at December 31, 2011 was $24 million in the U.K., $4 million in Canada, and a $1 million benefit in the Netherlands.  

 For the U.S. pension plans we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current  

64 

year's value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2011, the market-related value of assets was $1.4 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position which is based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of plan assets was $1.3 billion.  

 Our plans in the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada use fair value to determine expected return on assets.  

 Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation  

 The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Includes investments in infrastructure, real estate, limited partnerships and hedge funds.   

 In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.  

 The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The actual asset allocation at December 31, 2011 was 59% equity and 41% fixed income securities for the qualified plan.  

 The investment policy for each U.K. pension plan is generally determined by the plans' trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation represents a weighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change. In total, as of December 31, 2011, the U.K. plans were invested 39% in equity and 61% in fixed income securities. The Netherlands' plan was invested 35% in equity and 65% in fixed income securities. The Canadian plan was invested 59% in equity and 41% in fixed income securities.  

 Impact of changing economic assumptions  

 Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.

 Estimated future contributions  

 We estimate contributions of approximately $541 million in 2012 as compared with $477 million in 2011.  

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either trademarks, customer relationships, technology, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles.  

 Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued final guidance that gives an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may eliminate the requirement to perform the annual two-step test. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we also test the acquired trademarks (which also are not amortized) for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2011 or 2010 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or trademarks.  

 We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components  

66 

are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.  

 The goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, including goodwill, of the corresponding reporting unit. If the "more likely than not" threshold is not met, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.  

 In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2011 and 2010, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.  

 We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.  

 Contingencies  

 We define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one ore more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when it is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.

 Share-based Payments  

 Share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

 Stock Option accounting  

 We generally use a lattice-binomial option-pricing model to value stock options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options, and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on our stock.  

 In terms of the assumptions used in the lattice-based model, we:    

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model. We stratify employees between those receiving Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP") options, Special Stock Plan options, and all other option grants. We believe that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns,  

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate, and   

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   

 The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.  

 Restricted stock units  

 Restricted stock units ("RSUs") are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  

 Performance share awards  

 Performance share awards ("PSAs") are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.  

 PSAs may immediately vest at the end of the performance period or may have an additional service period. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance or additional service period, whichever is longer. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.  

 The largest performance-based share-based payment award plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. The 2009 to 2011 performance period ended on December 31, 2011, the 2008 to 2010 performance period ended on December 31, 2010, and the 2007 to 2009 performance period ended on December 31, 2009. The LPP currently has two ongoing performance periods: from 2010 to 2012 and 2011 to 2013. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both LPP plans would have increased our 2011 expense by approximately $4.9 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $4.9 million.  

68 

As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as well as U.S. federal and state tax laws. The estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item, such as the resolution of prior-year tax matters.  

 The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management's assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.  

 Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.  

 We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a 'more likely than not' determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations to the extent they are considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according to the Internal Revenue Code, and could materially affect our future effective tax rate.  

 We base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.  

 We operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance, when available, and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:    

the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue,  

to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities,  

tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes, and  

the proposed move of the corporate headquarters to London.
