Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data  

For fiscal year ended February 3, 2008 ("fiscal 2007"), we reported Net Earnings of $4.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.37 compared to Net Earnings of $5.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.79 for fiscal year ended January 28, 2007 ("fiscal 2006").  

On August 30, 2007, we closed the sale of HD Supply. We received net proceeds of $8.3 billion for the sale of HD Supply and recognized a loss of $4 million, net of tax, for the sale of the business. HD Supply is being reported as a discontinued operation in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented.  

We reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $4.2 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $2.27 for fiscal 2007 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $5.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $2.55 for fiscal 2006. Net Sales decreased 2.1% to $77.3 billion for fiscal 2007 from $79.0 billion for fiscal 2006. Our gross profit margin was 33.6% and our operating margin was 9.4% for fiscal 2007.  

Fiscal 2007 consisted of 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks for fiscal 2006. The 53rd week added approximately $1.1 billion in Net Sales and increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007.  

The slowdown in the residential construction and home improvement markets negatively affected our Net Sales for fiscal 2007. Our comparable store sales declined 6.7% in fiscal 2007 driven by a 4.4% decline in comparable store customer transactions, as well as a 2.4% decline in our average ticket to $57.48.  

We believe the residential construction and home improvement market will remain soft in 2008. We expect our Net Sales to decline by 4% to 5% and our Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations to decline by approximately 19% to 24% for fiscal 2008.  

We remain committed to the long-term health of our business through our strategy of investing in our retail business through the following five key priorities:  

Associate Engagement  We have taken a number of actions to improve associate engagement by changing the way our associates are compensated, recognized and rewarded, including restructuring our success sharing program, an incentive program for our hourly associates driven by individual store performance. As of the end of fiscal 2007, 44% of our stores were eligible to receive a success sharing payout for the second half of fiscal 2007 compared to 23% of stores for the same period last year. We also launched a program earlier this year to hire master trade specialists to bring electrical and plumbing experience and know-how to the stores and to transfer knowledge to other associates. We now have over 2,500 master trade specialists in our stores.  

Product Excitement  In fiscal 2007, we accelerated clearance markdowns to sell through existing product in order to make room for new merchandise as we launched our enhanced product line review process and in support of merchandising reset activities. We gained market share in paint, appliances and power tools in fiscal 2007 through the addition of new styles and color choices and by enhancing our product displays. In areas where we have completed our merchandising resets and implemented change from our product line review process, collectively these categories are outperforming store sales performance in line with our expectations.  

Shopping Environment  We continued our store reinvestment program by completing an aggressive list of maintenance projects, including new lighting and basic clean-up activities for over half of our stores, as well as more complex repair and maintenance activities for hundreds of other stores. In addition to programmatic maintenance, our integrated field and support center teams have rolled out store  

19 

standards to all stores. We developed and piloted common guidelines on store appearance and shopability, including standards for front apron merchandising, wingstack usage, signage presentation, fixturing and off-shelf product. This initiative helps reduce the amount of time our store managers spend on these issues, removes unnecessary clutter from the aisles and implements a basic consistent approach in terms of appearance.  

Product Availability  We are in the early stages of our supply chain transformation to improve product availability. We have improved management of our in-stock position, implemented enhancements to our replenishment systems and begun a rollout of a new warehouse management system. We also implemented a pilot of our Rapid Deployment Centers. Optimally, more volume will pass through the Rapid Deployment Centers than through our traditional distribution centers.  

Own the Pro  We have made significant improvements in the services we provide our pro customers, particularly through our pro bid room. The pro bid room, which is available in all of our stores, allows us to leverage the buying power of The Home Depot for the benefit of our pro customers. Our direct ship program allows us to have large orders delivered from our vendors to the customer's job site directly, reducing handling, lead-time and cost while building loyalty with the pro customer.  

We opened 110 new stores in fiscal 2007, including 10 relocations, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2007 to 2,234. As of the end of fiscal 2007, 243, or approximately 11%, of our stores were located in Canada, Mexico or China compared to 228 as of fiscal 2006.  

We generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007. We used this cash flow, along with the net proceeds from the sale of HD Supply, to fund $10.8 billion of share repurchases, including $10.7 billion used to repurchase 289 million shares of our common stock in connection with our tender offer, and $1.7 billion of cash dividends. We also spent $3.6 billion in capital expenditures.  

At the end of fiscal 2007, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 64.3% compared to 46.5% at the end of fiscal 2006. Our return on invested capital for continuing operations (computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing twelve months) was 13.9% at the end of fiscal 2007 compared to 16.8% for fiscal 2006.

We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. We operate in one operating segment and believe the information presented in our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an understanding of our business, our operations and our financial condition.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Results of Operations  

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report.  

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006  

Net Sales  

Fiscal 2007 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2006. Net Sales for fiscal 2007 decreased 2.1%, or $1.7 billion, to $77.3 billion from $79.0 billion for fiscal 2006. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales, partially offset by Net Sales of $3.7 billion for fiscal 2007 from new stores and $1.1 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007. Comparable store sales decreased 6.7% for fiscal 2007 compared to a decrease of 2.8% for fiscal 2006.  

There were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft, especially in some of our traditionally strong markets such as Florida, California and the Northeast. We saw relative strength in Flooring, Plumbing, Garden, and Paint as comparable store sales in these areas were above the Company average for fiscal 2007. We gained market share in power tools and equipment, due in part to our launch of Ryobi One+ lithium products in fiscal 2007. Comparable store sales for Lumber, Building Materials, Hardware, Lighting, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork were below the Company average for fiscal 2007. The combination of softness in our big ticket categories and commodity price deflation negatively impacted average ticket, which decreased 2.4% to $57.48 for fiscal 2007.  

Our international business performed well in fiscal 2007. Our Mexican stores posted a double digit comparable store sales increase for fiscal 2007, and Canada's comparable store sales were also positive.  

In order to meet our customer service objectives, we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores ("cannibalize") to enhance service levels, gain incremental sales and increase market penetration. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 10% of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2007, which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1%.  

We believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. Due to the highly-fragmented U.S. home improvement industry, in which we estimate our market share is approximately 15%, measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult.  

Gross Profit  

Gross Profit decreased 2.1% to $26.0 billion for fiscal 2007 from $26.5 billion for fiscal 2006. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.6% for fiscal 2007, flat compared to fiscal 2006. Lower deferred interest costs associated with our private label credit card financing programs provided a benefit of 39 basis points to Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2007. Through our private label credit card, we offer no interest/no payment programs. The cost of deferred interest associated with these programs is included in Cost of Sales. For fiscal 2007, the penetration of our private label and co-branded credit sales was 29.4% compared to 28.0% for fiscal 2006. The deferred interest benefit was mostly offset by a higher penetration of lower margin products such as appliances and markdowns taken to clear through some seasonal items, such as outdoor power equipment and grills, and to allow us to transition into new products, such as assembled cabinets and kitchen accessories.  

22 

Operating Expenses  

Operating Expenses increased 6.1% to $18.8 billion for fiscal 2007 from $17.7 billion for fiscal 2006. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 24.3% for fiscal 2007 compared to 22.4% for fiscal 2006.  

Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased 5.9% to $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007 from $16.1 billion for fiscal 2006. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 22.1% for fiscal 2007 compared to 20.4% for fiscal 2006. Our deleverage in SG&A reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales, where for every one percentage point of negative comparable store sales, we expect to deleverage expenses by about 20 basis points. Additionally in fiscal 2007, our profit sharing with the third-party administrator of the private label credit card portfolio was $275 million less than what we received in fiscal 2006. We account for profit sharing as a reduction in operating expense. We also recognized $88 million of write-offs associated with certain future store locations that we determined we will not open and $34 million of expense associated with closing our 11 Home Depot Landscape Supply stores and our Tampa Call Center in fiscal 2007. SG&A also reflects investments we are making in support of our five key priorities. As a percentage of Net Sales, total payroll increased by 76 basis points for fiscal 2007 over the same period last year. This reflects investments in store labor and our Master Trade Specialists program, the impact of our success sharing bonus plans, as well as the negative sales environment. The increase in SG&A for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was partially offset by $129 million of executive severance recorded in fiscal 2006.  

Depreciation and Amortization increased 8.1% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2007 from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2006. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.2% for fiscal 2007 and 2.0% for fiscal 2006. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology.  

Operating Income  

Operating Income decreased 18.3% to $7.2 billion for fiscal 2007 from $8.9 billion for fiscal 2006. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 9.4% for fiscal 2007 compared to 11.2% for fiscal 2006.  

Interest, net  

In fiscal 2007, we recognized $622 million of net Interest Expense compared to $364 million in fiscal 2006. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2007 compared to 0.5% for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the December 2006 issuance of $750 million of floating rate Senior Notes, $1.25 billion of 5.25% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.875% Senior Notes.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

Our combined federal and state effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 36.4% for fiscal 2007 from 38.1% for fiscal 2006. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of a one-time retroactive tax assessment received from the Canadian province of Quebec in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and tax benefits recognized upon settlement of several state audits and completion of the fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal tax audits in fiscal 2007.  

Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  

Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.27 for fiscal 2007 and $2.55 for fiscal 2006. The 53rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were  

23 

favorably impacted in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our $40.0 billion repurchase authorization. We repurchased 293 million shares for $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007 and 174 million shares for $6.7 billion in fiscal 2006. Since the inception of the program in 2002, we have repurchased 743 million shares of our common stock for a total of $27.2 billion. As of February 3, 2008, we had $12.8 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.  

Discontinued Operations  

Discontinued operations consist of the results of operations through August 30, 2007 and a loss on the sale of HD Supply. Net Sales from discontinued operations were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2007 compared to $11.8 billion for fiscal 2006. Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were $185 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $495 million for last year. Earnings from Discontinued Operations for fiscal 2007 include a $4 million loss, net of tax, recognized on the sale of the business.  

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2006 ("fiscal 2005")  

Net Sales  

Net Sales for fiscal 2006 increased 2.6%, or $2.0 billion, to $79.0 billion from $77.0 billion for fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 Net Sales growth was primarily driven by Net Sales of $4.0 billion from new stores. Comparable store sales decreased 2.8% for fiscal 2006 compared to an increase of 3.1% for fiscal 2005. The decline in comparable store sales was driven by a 4.6% decline in comparable store customer transactions offset in part by a 1.6% increase in average ticket. Our average ticket increased to $58.90 for fiscal 2006 and increased in 8 of 10 selling departments. The decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 was due to the significant slowdown in the U.S. retail home improvement market as well as difficult year-over-year comparisons due to sales arising from hurricane activity in fiscal 2005. Both Canada and Mexico experienced positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2006. Additionally, our comparable store sales results reflect in part the impact of cannibalization. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 14% of our existing stores during fiscal 2006, which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 2%.  

Gross Profit  

Gross Profit increased 2.3% to $26.5 billion for fiscal 2006 from $25.9 billion for fiscal 2005. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales decreased 9 basis points to 33.6% for fiscal 2006 compared to 33.7% for fiscal 2005. The decline in Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales reflects a changing mix of products sold primarily due to growth in appliances whose margin rate is below the Company average.  

Operating Expenses  

Operating Expenses increased 4.7% to $17.7 billion for fiscal 2006 from $16.9 billion for fiscal 2005. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.4% for fiscal 2006 compared to 21.9% for fiscal 2005.  

SG&A increased 4.0% to $16.1 billion for fiscal 2006 from $15.5 billion for fiscal 2005. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.4% for fiscal 2006 and 20.1% for fiscal 2005. The increase in SG&A during fiscal 2006 was due to added associate labor hours on the floor of our stores, increased spending on store maintenance programs and the expansion of merchandise display resets. This increase was partially offset by reduced self-insurance costs as we continue to realize benefits from safety programs and other initiatives. Also in fiscal 2006, we received more benefits under our profit sharing provision with the third-party administrator of the private label credit card portfolio than in fiscal 2005.  

Also impacting our SG&A in fiscal 2006 was expense associated with executive severance of $129 million and the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R),  

24 

"Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"), whereby we recorded approximately $40 million of stock compensation expense related to the continued vesting of options granted prior to fiscal 2003. Partially offsetting the increase in SG&A was $91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations associated with the closing of 20 EXPO Design Center stores in fiscal 2005.  

Depreciation and Amortization increased 11.6% to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2006 from $1.4 billion for fiscal 2005. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.0% for fiscal 2006 and 1.8% for fiscal 2005. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology.  

Operating Income  

Operating Income decreased 2.0% to $8.9 billion for fiscal 2006 from $9.0 billion for fiscal 2005. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 11.2% for fiscal 2006 and 11.8% for fiscal 2005.  

Interest, net  

In fiscal 2006, we recognized $364 million of net Interest Expense compared to $80 million in fiscal 2005. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.5% for fiscal 2006 compared to 0.1% for fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the March 2006 issuance of $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.40% Senior Notes and the December 2006 issuance of $750 million of floating rate Senior Notes, $1.25 billion of 5.25% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.875% Senior Notes.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

Our combined federal, state and foreign effective income tax rate increased to 38.1% for fiscal 2006 from 37.1% for fiscal 2005. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the impact of a retroactive tax assessment from the Canadian province of Quebec. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Quebec National Assembly passed legislation that retroactively changed certain tax laws that subjected us to additional tax and interest. As a result, we received an assessment from Quebec for $57 million in retroactive tax and $12 million in related interest for the 2002 through 2005 taxable years.  

Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  

Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.55 for fiscal 2006 and $2.63 for fiscal 2005. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 by the repurchase of shares of our common stock.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2007, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $5.7 billion as compared to $7.7 billion for fiscal 2006. This change was primarily a result of decreased Net Earnings and changes in working capital.  

Investing activities provided $4.8 billion for fiscal 2007 compared to $7.6 billion used in investing activities for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily the result of $8.3 billion of net proceeds from the sale of HD Supply in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and $4.3 billion less in Payments for Businesses Acquired in fiscal 2007. The sale of HD Supply principally resulted in reductions in the following balance sheet accounts: Receivables, Merchandise Inventories, Goodwill, Other Assets, Accounts Payable and Accrued Salaries and Related Expenses.  

Additionally in fiscal 2007, we spent $3.6 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 56% for new stores, 8% for store modernization, 15% for technology and 21% for other initiatives. Of the  

25 

$3.6 billion in capital expenditures approximately $3.4 billion was for retail operations. In fiscal 2007, we added 110 new stores, including 10 relocations.  

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2007 was $10.6 billion compared with $203 million for fiscal 2006. The increase in Net Cash Used in Financing Activities was primarily due to $4.1 billion more in common stock share repurchases than last year, including the repurchase of 289 million shares of our common stock for $10.7 billion in connection with our tender offer, along with $8.9 billion less in Proceeds from Borrowings of Long-Term Debt in fiscal 2007.  

On June 18, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized a recapitalization of the Company, including an additional $22.5 billion in common stock repurchases. We closed the sale of HD Supply on August 30, 2007 and used the proceeds from the sale and cash on hand to repurchase 289 million shares of our common stock for $10.7 billion, or $37 per share, in settlement of a related tender offer. In November 2007, we retired 735 million shares of our treasury stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 743 million shares of our common stock for a total of $27.2 billion. As of February 3, 2008, $12.8 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. We anticipate issuing debt to complete the remainder of our recapitalization plan.  

We have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. As of February 3, 2008, there was $1.7 billion outstanding under the commercial paper programs and there were no borrowings outstanding under the related credit facility. We do not foresee borrowings under the commercial paper programs beyond the $3.0 billion back-up credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2010, contains various restrictive covenants, all of which we are in compliance with. None of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.  

We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2007, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 64.3% compared to 46.5% at the end of fiscal 2006. This increase reflects the net increase in Long-Term Debt as a result of the December 2006 Issuance of $750 million of floating rate Senior Notes, $1.25 billion of 5.25% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.875% Senior Notes.  

As of February 3, 2008, we had $457 million in Cash and Short-Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements.  

During fiscal 2007, we entered into interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with notional amounts of $2.0 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $3.0 billion 5.40% Senior Notes for variable rate interest equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 149 basis points that expire on March 1, 2016. At February 3, 2008, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $29 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle similar interest rate swap agreements at current interest rates.  

Also during fiscal 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, with a notional amount of $750 million that swaps variable rate interest on our $750 million floating rate Senior Notes for fixed rate interest at 4.36% that expires on December 16, 2009. At February 3, 2008, the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of $17 million, which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle similar interest rate swap agreements at current interest rates.  

26 

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 3, 2008 (amounts in millions):   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $415 million. Includes $7.0 billion of interest payments and $65 million of unamortized discount. 

(2) Includes $872 million of imputed interest. 

(3) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. 

(4) Excludes $602 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments related to the FIN 48 liabilities.  

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  

As of February 3, 2008 we had, net of discounts, $11.0 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The market values of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of February 3, 2008, were approximately $10.5 billion.  

Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices  

We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations.  

27 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.  

Revenue Recognition  

We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales.  

Merchandise Inventories  

Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 89% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under the cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2007 or 2006.  

Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.  

Self-Insurance  

We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers' compensation and medical claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these

estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.  

Vendor Allowances  

Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors.  

Volume rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense.  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when management makes the decision to relocate or close a store or other location, or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A store's assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, a provision is made to write down the related assets to fair value if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual results differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a location closes, we also recognize in SG&A the net present value of future lease obligations, less estimated sublease income.  

In fiscal 2005, we recorded $91 million in SG&A related to asset impairment charges and on-going lease obligations associated with closing 20 EXPO Design Center stores. Additionally, we recorded $29 million of expense in Cost of Sales in fiscal 2005 related to inventory markdowns in these stores. We also recorded impairments on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and will therefore be effective for The Home Depot in fiscal 2008. Implementation of SFAS 157 as it relates to the fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity's financial statements on a recurring basis, has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition of the Company.
