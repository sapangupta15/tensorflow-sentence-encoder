ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Background  

Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries, principally from our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2016, approximately 199 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights.  

We are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation, to building the best employee relations in the industry and to providing returns for our stockholders. In January 2017, we were named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World, which cited the integration work related to the Merger, our operational and customer service improvements and the investments we are making in our product.  

Operational Highlights  

During 2016, we made significant investments related to our integration and to continue to improve our product offerings and operational performance.  

Integration Accomplishments  

       Integrated all mainline pilots and our mainline fleet into a single scheduling system, allowing us to schedule pilots and aircraft seamlessly across the network regardless of which pre-Merger airline they came from  

       Reached interim agreements with the TWU-IAM that allows our mainline mechanics and ramp personnel to be able to work together and be cross-utilized. Additionally, we ratified five-year JCBAs for dispatchers, flight crew training instructors, simulator pilot instructors and flight simulator engineers  

       Completed the painting of all US Airways mainline aircraft in the American livery. Repainting of former US Airways Express regional jets is expected to be finished in mid-2017  

Investments in Our Product and Operations  

       Invested approximately $4.4 billion in new aircraft, including 55 new mainline and 42 new regional aircraft. As a result of our ongoing fleet renewal program, we have the youngest fleet of the major U.S. network carriers  

       Hired additional personnel and invested in new equipment and technology to support our operations. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we achieved our best monthly completion factor, on-time performance, and baggage handling performance since the Merger  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Introduced Premium Economy, a new class of service on international flights with more legroom, wider seats, and enhanced meal service and amenity kits  

       Made several other customer experience improvements including the reintroduction of free snacks in the main cabin, the launch of complimentary in-flight entertainment and the redesign and upgrade of many Admirals Club lounges

Investments in our People  

       Instituted a profit sharing program across all of our workgroups that pays 5% of our pre-tax profit excluding special items ($314 million was accrued in 2016)  

       Announced industry-leading pay packages for pilots at our wholly-owned regional airlines Envoy, PSA and Piedmont in order to attract and retain the best pilots  

Financial Overview  

The U.S. Airline Industry  

In 2016, the U.S. airline industry benefited from lower fuel prices. However, the reductions in fuel costs were offset by year-over-year declines in revenue. Both domestic and international markets were impacted by competitive capacity growth. International markets were also impacted by macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness.  

Jet fuel prices closely follow the price of Brent crude oil. On average, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel was approximately 17% lower in 2016 as compared to 2015. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during 2016 was $44 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $52 per barrel during 2015. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during 2016 between a high of $55 per barrel to a low of $26 per barrel, and closed the year on December 31, 2016 at $55 per barrel.  

While jet fuel prices have declined year-over-year as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these declines. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.  

AAGs 2016 Results  

The selected financial data presented below is derived from AAGs audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Income and Pre-Tax Income  

We realized net income of $2.7 billion in 2016. This compares to $7.6 billion of net income in 2015, which included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit, as we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, we recorded a $1.6 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax provision and net income are not comparable to 2015. Therefore, pre-tax income and pre-tax income excluding special items provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. The exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to financial measures presented by other major airlines. Management uses pre-tax income excluding special items to evaluate our financial performance.  

We realized pre-tax income of $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax special items, pre-tax income was $5.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our 2016 pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were higher in 2016, driven by our new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.  

For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data  Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

Revenue  

In 2016, we reported operating revenues of $40.2 billion, a decrease of $810 million, or 2.0%, as compared to 2015. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $34.6 billion, a decrease of $933 million, or 2.6%, as compared to 2015. The decline in mainline and regional passenger revenues was due to lower yields driven by competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness. This decline was offset in part by an increase in other operating revenues primarily due to our new co-branded credit card agreements which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. Our mainline and regional total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 14.70 cents in 2016, a 3.7% decrease as compared to 15.25 cents in 2015.  

Fuel  

Our mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $6.2 billion in 2016, which was $1.3 billion, or 17.1%, lower as compared to 2015. This decrease was driven by a 17.6% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.42 in 2016 from $1.72 in 2015.  

As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.

Other Costs  

We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.  

Our 2016 mainline CASM was 11.94 cents, a decrease of 0.8%, from 12.03 cents in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower fuel costs, offset in part by higher salaries, wages and benefits associated with new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program.  

Our 2016 mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel was 9.54 cents, an increase of 6.1%, from 8.99 cents in 2015, which was primarily driven by higher salaries, wages and benefits as described above.  

For a reconciliation of mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data  Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

Liquidity and Stockholder Returns  

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $8.8 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $6.4 billion in unrestricted cash and investments and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. We also had approximately $638 million in restricted cash.  

During 2016, we returned $4.6 billion to our stockholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $224 million and the repurchase of $4.4 billion of common stock, or 119.8 million shares. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have returned more than $9.6 billion to stockholders including $646 million in quarterly dividends and $9.0 billion in share repurchases, or 228.4 million shares. In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization that will expire December 31, 2018 and declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid to stockholders of record as of February 13, 2017.  

We have taken advantage of historically low interest rates to finance our fleet renewal program. During 2016 to finance new aircraft deliveries, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.8 billion in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) equipment notes at an average fixed interest rate of 3.63%, as well as $1.8 billion in other equipment notes, which bear interest at fixed and variable rates of LIBOR plus margin, averaging 2.96% at December 31, 2016. Additionally, we refinanced certain higher cost debt. See Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our debt obligations.  

As a result of the foregoing factors, we currently have a higher debt level and fewer unencumbered assets than our peers. Accordingly, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage as well as to protect against an adverse economic shock. Our current plan is to maintain minimum total available liquidity of $7.0 billion. We were well above that minimum level at December 31, 2016.

Results of Operations  2016 Compared to 2015  

We realized net income of $2.7 billion in 2016. This compares to $7.6 billion of net income in 2015, which included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit as we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, we recorded a $1.6 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax provision and net income are not comparable to 2015.  

We realized pre-tax income of $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $5.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

Our 2016 pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were higher in 2016, driven by our new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.  

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating revenues in 2016 decreased $810 million, or 2.0%, from 2015 driven by lower passenger revenues offset in part by higher other revenue. Our mainline and regional TRASM was 14.70 cents in 2016, a 3.7% decrease as compared to 15.25 cents in 2015.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total passenger revenues declined $933 million, or 2.6%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by a 2.8% decrease in yield due to competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness.  

Cargo revenue decreased $60 million, or 7.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven primarily by a decrease in domestic and international freight yields.  

55  

Table of Contents 

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $183 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In 2016 and 2015, other revenues associated with our loyalty program were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. This year-over-year increase was due to our new co-branded credit card agreements which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. See Note 1(i) to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on the loyalty program.  

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses were $34.9 billion in 2016, an increase of $110 million, or 0.3%, from 2015. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these costs were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in mainline operating costs per ASM.

Mainline Operating Costs per ASM  

The table below sets forth the major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and aircraft fuel and related taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and that is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.  

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating cost per ASM are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 19.3% primarily due to an 18.2% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.41 in 2016 from an average price per gallon of $1.72 in 2015.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 13.2% primarily due to increased costs associated with new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program.  

       Selling expenses per ASM decreased 6.0% primarily due to lower credit card and booking fees.  

       Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 10.7% primarily due to the effect of purchased aircraft deliveries in connection with our fleet renewal program.

Table of Contents 

Operating Special Items, Net  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Merger integration costs included charges related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, relocation, training and severance, and in 2015, also included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015.  

 (2)   Fleet restructuring costs included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft currently grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.  

 (3)   Regional operating special items, net are included within other regional operating expenses and principally related to Merger integration costs.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses increased $61 million, or 1.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a $182 million, or 3.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses driven by increased capacity. This was offset in part by a $121 million, or 9.8%, decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was driven primarily by a 14.5% decline in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.48 in 2016 from $1.73 in 2015, offset in part by a 5.5% increase in gallons of fuel consumed. See Note 1 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on regional expenses.  

Nonoperating Results  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $24 million, or 60.9%, principally due to a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2016 as compared to 2015.  

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased in 2016 primarily due to issuances of aircraft-related financings associated with our fleet renewal program.  

58  

Table of Contents 

In 2016, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $49 million of net special charges consisting of debt issuance and extinguishment costs associated with bond and term loan refinancings. Net foreign currency gains were nominal in 2016.  

In 2015, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. We also incurred $159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.  

Income Taxes  

In 2016, we recorded a $1.6 billion provision for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 38%, which was substantially non-cash as we utilized our NOLs. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017.  

In 2015, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.  

See Note 6 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.  

Results of Operations  2015 Compared to 2014  

We realized net income of $7.6 billion in 2015, which included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit as we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. We realized net income of $2.9 billion in 2014. As a result of the valuation allowance reversal, amounts reported in 2015 for income tax benefit and net income are not comparable to 2014.  

We realized pre-tax income of $4.6 billion and $3.2 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $6.3 billion and $4.2 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

Our 2015 pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by substantially lower fuel costs in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset in part by a decline in revenues driven by lower yields.  

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

59  

Table of Contents 

Total operating revenues in 2015 decreased $1.7 billion, or 3.9%, from 2014 principally driven by lower passenger revenues. Our mainline and regional TRASM was 15.25 cents in 2015, a 5.0% decrease as compared to 16.05 cents in 2014.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total passenger revenues declined $1.6 billion, or 4.3%, in 2015 from 2014 driven by a 6.5% decrease in yield due to competitive growth in certain domestic markets, including Dallas/Fort Worth, international weakness resulting from foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar, lower fuel surcharges and economic softness in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela.  

Cargo revenue decreased $115 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in international freight yields.  

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. In 2015 and 2014, other revenues associated with our loyalty program were each $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. See Note 1(i) to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on the loyalty program.  

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses were $34.8 billion in 2015, a decrease of $3.6 billion, or 9.4%, from 2014. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to substantially lower aircraft fuel costs, offset

 in part by higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new labor contracts. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in mainline operating costs per ASM.  

Mainline Operating Costs per ASM  

The table below sets forth the major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and aircraft fuel and related taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and that is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.  

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating cost per ASM are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 41.7% primarily due to a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in 2015 from an average price per gallon of $2.91 in 2014.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 11.1% primarily due to increased costs associated with new pilot, flight attendant and customer service and reservation agent joint collective bargaining agreements.  

       Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM decreased 8.6% primarily due to fewer engine overhauls in 2015, driven by our fleet renewal program.  

       Selling expenses per ASM decreased 10.5% primarily due to lower contractually negotiated rates for certain commissions and booking fees as well as lower revenues in 2015.  

       Other operating expenses per ASM increased 5.4% in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in crew travel and certain information technology projects, as well as enhancements to our aircraft food and catering offerings.

Operating Special Items, Net  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Merger integration costs included charges related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, relocation and training, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms and share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015.  

 (2)   Fleet restructuring costs included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft currently grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.  

 (3)   Regional operating special items, net are included within other regional operating expenses and consisted primarily of a $24 million charge due to a new pilot labor contract at our Envoy regional subsidiary.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses decreased $533 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $779 million, or 38.8%, decrease in fuel costs, offset in part by a $246 million, or 5.4%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel decreased 40.9% to $1.73 in 2015 from $2.92 in 2014. The increase in other regional operating expenses was principally due to increased flying under capacity purchase agreements. See Note 1 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on regional expenses.

 currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.  

In 2014, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $114 million of net foreign currency losses, including a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses and $56 million of special charges primarily due to early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of our 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness. The foreign currency losses in 2014 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in the Latin American market.  

Income Taxes  

In 2015, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.  

In 2014, we recorded a $330 million provision for income taxes, which included $346 million of special tax charges. During 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. As a result, a special $330 million non-cash tax provision was recorded, which is the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts.  

See Note 6 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.  

Americans Results of Operations  

Results of Operations  2016 Compared to 2015  

American realized net income of $2.8 billion in 2016. This compares to $8.1 billion of net income in 2015, which included a special $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit as American reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which include its federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, American recorded a $1.7 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax provision and net income are not comparable to 2015.  

American realized pre-tax income of $4.4 billion and $4.7 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Americans 2016 pre-tax income was impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were higher in 2016, driven by Americans new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.  

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating revenues in 2016 decreased $775 million, or 1.9%, from 2015 driven by lower passenger revenues offset in part by higher other revenue.  

63  

Table of Contents 

Total passenger revenues declined $933 million, or 2.6%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by a decrease in yield due to competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness.  

Cargo revenue decreased $60 million, or 7.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven primarily by a decrease in domestic and international freight yields.  

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with Americans loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $218 million, or 4.7%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In 2016 and 2015, other revenues associated with Americans loyalty program were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. This year-over-year increase was due to Americans new co-branded credit card agreements which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. See Note 1(i) to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on the loyalty program.  

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses were $34.9 billion in 2016, an increase of $110 million, or 0.3%, from 2015. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these costs were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.  

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expenses are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 18.5% primarily due to an 18.2% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.41 in 2016 from an average price per gallon of $1.72 in 2015.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits increased 14.4% primarily due to increased costs associated with new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program.  

       Selling expenses decreased 5.0% primarily due to lower credit card and booking fees.  

64  

Table of Contents 

       Depreciation and amortization increased 11.8% primarily due to the effect of purchased aircraft deliveries in connection with Americans fleet renewal program.  

Operating Special Items, Net  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Merger integration costs included charges related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, relocation, training and severance, and in 2015, also included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015.  

 (2)   Fleet restructuring costs included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft currently grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.  

 (3)   Regional operating special items, net are included within other regional operating expenses and principally related to Merger integration costs.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses increased $57 million, or 1.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a $178 million, or 3.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses driven by increased capacity. This was offset in part by a $121 million, or 9.8%, decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was driven primarily by a 14.5% decline in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.48 in 2016 from $1.73 in 2015, offset in part by a 5.5% increase in gallons of fuel consumed. See Note 1 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on regional expenses.  

Nonoperating Results  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Americans short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $55 million principally due to a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2016 as compared to 2015.  

65  

Table of Contents 

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased in 2016 primarily due to issuances of aircraft-related financings associated with Americans fleet renewal program.  

In 2016, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $49 million of net special charges consisting of debt issuance and extinguishment costs associated with bond and term loan refinancings. Net foreign currency gains were nominal in 2016.  

In 2015, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. American also incurred $159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.  

Income Taxes  

In 2016, American recorded a $1.7 billion provision for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 37%, which was substantially non-cash as American utilized its NOLs. Substantially all of Americans income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017.  

In 2015, American reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in Americans consolidated statement of operations.  

See Note 4 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.  

Results of Operations  2015 Compared to 2014  

American realized net income of $8.1 billion in 2015, which included a special $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit as American reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which include its federal and state NOLs. American realized net income of $2.9 billion in 2014. As a result of the valuation allowance reversal, amounts reported in 2015 for income tax benefit and net income are not comparable to 2014.  

American realized pre-tax income of $4.7 billion and $3.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Americans 2015 pre-tax income was impacted by substantially lower fuel costs in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset in part by a decline in revenues driven by lower yields.  

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating revenues in 2015 decreased $1.7 billion, or 4.1%, from 2014 principally driven by lower passenger revenues.  

66  

Table of Contents 

Total passenger revenues declined $1.6 billion, or 4.3%, in 2015 from 2014 driven by a decrease in yield due to competitive growth in certain domestic markets, including Dallas/Fort Worth, international weakness resulting from foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar, lower fuel surcharges and economic softness in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela.  

Cargo revenue decreased $115 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in international freight yields.  

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with Americans loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. In 2015 and 2014, other revenues associated with Americans loyalty program were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. See Note 1(i) to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on the loyalty program.  

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses were $34.7 billion in 2015, a decrease of $3.7 billion, or 9.5%, from 2014. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to substantially lower aircraft fuel costs, offset in part by higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new labor contracts.  

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expenses are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 41.2% primarily due to a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in 2015 from an average price per gallon of $2.91 in 2014.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits increased 11.9% primarily due to increased costs associated with new pilot, flight attendant and customer service and reservation agent joint collective bargaining agreements.  

       Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased 7.9% primarily due to fewer engine overhauls in 2015, driven by Americans fleet renewal program.

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses decreased $525 million, or 8.1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $779 million, or 38.8%, decrease in fuel costs, offset in part by a $254 million, or 5.7%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel decreased 40.9% to $1.73 in 2015 from $2.92 in 2014. The increase in other regional operating expenses was principally due to increased flying under capacity purchase agreements.

American also incurred $159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.  

In 2014, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $114 million of net foreign currency losses, including a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses and $56 million of special charges primarily due to early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness. The foreign currency losses in 2014 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in the Latin American market.  

Income Taxes  

In 2015, American reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in Americans consolidated statement of operations.  

In 2014, American recorded a $320 million provision for income taxes, which included $344 million of special tax charges. During 2014, American sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. As a result, a special $328 million non-cash tax provision was recorded, which is the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of Americans fuel hedging contracts.  

See Note 4 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity  

As of December 31, 2016, AAG had approximately $8.8 billion in total available liquidity and $638 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail of our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Sources and Uses of Cash  

AAG and American  

2016 Compared to 2015  

Operating Activities  

AAGs net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 billion and $6.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. While AAGs profitability was lower in 2016 as compared to 2015, cash provided by operating activities increased $275 million driven by certain payments received related to our new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016.  

69  

Table of Contents 

Americans net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $837 million. We have the ability to move funds freely between our subsidiaries to support our cash requirements. The decline in Americans operating cash flows from 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to intercompany transfers of cash from American to AAG in order to fund higher share repurchases in 2016. Additionally, in 2015, Americans operating cash flows included the proceeds from the $500 million issuance of AAGs 4.625% senior notes, which also contributed to the year-over-year decline in operating cash flows. These declines were offset in part by the cash payments related to credit card agreements discussed above.  

Investing Activities  

AAGs net cash used in investing activities was $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Americans net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion in each of 2016 and 2015.  

AAG and Americans principal investing activities in 2016 each included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, primarily 97 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft. We also had net purchases of $149 million of short-term investments.  

AAG and Americans principal investing activities in 2015 included expenditures of $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, for property and equipment, primarily 114 newly delivered aircraft and eight spare engines, including 38 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft and the purchase of five Boeing 757 aircraft previously being leased. These cash outflows were offset in part by $391 million in net sales of short-term investments.  

Financing Activities  

AAGs net cash used in financing activities was $894 million and $1.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Americans net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

AAG and Americans principal financing activities in 2016 each included proceeds of $7.7 billion from the issuance of debt, including the $2.8 billion issuance of EETCs by American, the $2.3 billion provided under the April 2016 and December 2016 Credit Facilities, the issuance of $844 million of special facility revenue refunding bonds related to JFK and an additional $1.8 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $3.8 billion by AAG and American, primarily including the repayment of approximately $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-1 term loans, respectively, and the refunding of approximately $1.0 billion of special facility revenue bonds related to JFK. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $224 million in dividend payments.  

AAG and Americans principal financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of $5.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, including the $2.3 billion issuance of EETCs by American, the $500 million issuance of 4.625% senior notes by AAG and other aircraft-related financings. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.2 billion by AAG and American, including the $400 million repayment of Americans AAdvantage loan with Citibank. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $3.8 billion in share repurchases and $278 million in dividend payments.

2015 Compared to 2014  

Operating Activities  

AAGs net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 billion and $3.1 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased profitability driven by substantially lower fuel costs. In addition, a decrease in pension contributions from $810 million in 2014 to $6 million in 2015 contributed to increased operating cash flows. Our 2015 profitability was negatively affected by a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

Americans net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in each of 2015 and 2014. Cash flows were generated from increased profitability, driven by substantially lower fuel costs and a decrease in pension contributions, which were offset in part by Americans funding of AAGs share repurchase activities. Americans 2015 profitability was negatively affected by a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion and $2.9 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for both AAG and American.  

AAG and Americans principal investing activities in 2015 included expenditures of $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, for property and equipment, primarily 114 newly delivered aircraft and eight spare engines, including 38 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft and five Boeing 757 aircraft previously being leased. These cash outflows were offset in part by $391 million in net sales of short-term investments.  

AAG and Americans principal investing activities in 2014 each included expenditures of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, primarily 70 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Boeing 777 aircraft, and three Airbus A330 aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased, including nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 aircraft and three Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments and $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA slots.  

Financing Activities  

AAGs net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion and $315 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Americans net cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 billion and $143 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

AAG and Americans principal financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of $5.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, including the $2.3 billion issuance of EETCs by American, the $500 million issuance of 4.625% senior notes by AAG and other aircraft-related financings. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.2 billion by AAG and American, including the $400 million repayment of Americans AAdvantage loan with Citibank. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $3.8 billion in share repurchases and $278 million in dividend payments.  

AAG and Americans principal financing activities in 2014 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of $3.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, including the $1.5 billion issuance of EETCs by American, $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% senior notes by AAG and the term

 loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $3.1 billion by AAG and $3.0 billion by American, including the $1.0 billion prepayment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes and the $366 million prepayment of certain airport facility revenue bonds. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $144 million in dividend payments.  

Credit Ratings  

The following table details our credit ratings as of December 31, 2016:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *  The credit agency does not rate this category for this entity.  

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.  

Commitments  

For further information regarding our commitments, see the Notes to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and the Notes to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 11 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 9 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  

72  

Table of Contents 

Special Facility Revenue Bonds  

We guarantee the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which are leased to us. Under such leases, we are required to make rental payments through 2035, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest payments on the related bonds. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining lease payments guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $605 million, which are accounted for as operating leases.  

Pass-Through Trusts  

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with EETCs, issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.  

Each trust covers a set number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes are issued, at Americans election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2016, $10.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  

With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircrafts fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. Americans total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.

 (8)   Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and retiree medical and other postretirement benefit payments and is based on estimated payments through 2026. The total pension contribution of $279 million in 2017 assumes a supplemental contribution of $254 million in addition to the $25 million minimum required contribution. See Note 9 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on our minimum pension obligations.  

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions  

In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.  

In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under  

75

 different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 1 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.  

Passenger Revenue  

Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. Our air traffic liability was $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and other airline industry participants have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed.  

Loyalty Program  

We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American or other participating partner airlines.  

We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our loyalty program liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.  

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits, even mileage credits for members whose account balances have not yet reached the minimum level required to redeem an award. Mileage credits are subject to expiration. The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The estimated incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These costs and estimates are based on our historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of passenger revenue.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the liability for outstanding mileage credits accounted for under the incremental cost method was $669 million and $657 million, respectively, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability.  

A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the liability. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have an approximate $38 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2016. A 10% increase or decrease in the assumed price per gallon of fuel would have an approximate $9 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2016.  

Additionally, we applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger in December 2013 and recorded a liability for outstanding US Airways mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. At December 31, 2016, all the mileage credits associated with this liability have been recognized in passenger revenue. At December 31, 2015, this liability was $296 million and was included on the consolidated balance sheet within the loyalty program liability.  

We also sell loyalty program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We account for mileage sales under our agreements with non-airline business partners in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. In accordance with Topic 605, we allocate the consideration received from the sale of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.  

In 2016, American entered into new co-branded credit card program agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; the use of the American brand including access to loyalty program member lists, advertising and other travel related benefits (collectively, the marketing component).  

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and is amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits recorded within loyalty program liability on our consolidated balance sheets.  

A change to certain estimates used in the allocation of consideration received from the sale of mileage credits could have a material impact on the liability. A 10% increase or decrease in the relative selling price of the transportation component would have an approximate $81 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2016.  

The services under the marketing component are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments included in other revenues was approximately $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.  

Long-lived Assets  

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment, as well as other fixed assets and finite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements,

Table of Contents 

 tradenames and airport gate leasehold rights. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Finite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.  

We record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value.  

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Estimates of fair value represent managements best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.  

The majority of Americans fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.  

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets  

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.  

Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain domestic airport slots at our hubs and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining per mile passenger yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.  

If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under the quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the following assumptions: (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates depending on the asset, (4) a tax rate and (5) market prices for comparable assets. These assumptions are consistent with those which hypothetical market participants would use. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach, we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value.

Based upon our annual assessment, there were no impairments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in 2016.  

Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits  

We recognize the funded status (i.e. the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  

Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and (iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2016 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.2 billion and $44 million, respectively, and increase estimated 2017 pension expense by $4 million and decrease estimated 2017 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by $1 million.  

 (2)   The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 30% U.S. stocks, 22% developed international stocks, 20% long duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds, 20% alternative (private) investments and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2016 would increase estimated 2017 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $51 million and $1 million, respectively.  

 (3)   The assumed health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2017 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by $5 million.  

During 2016, we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans of $146 million and $5 million, respectively. We also reviewed and revised certain other economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates  

79

 and health care cost and trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $891 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in a decrease of $65 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016.  

See Note 9 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.  

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.  

We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our projections of future profitability, including risks associated with remaining Merger integration activities as well as other conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand.  

In connection with the preparation of our financial statements at the end of 2015, we determined that after considering all positive and negative evidence, including the completion of certain critical Merger integration milestones as well as our financial performance, it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred income tax assets, which include our NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Revenue  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted; however, we currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.  

We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will

Table of Contents 

 materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger (see Note 1 (i) Loyalty Program to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 (i) Loyalty Program to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B). The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue.  

Leases  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases.  

See Note 1 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on recent accounting pronouncements.
