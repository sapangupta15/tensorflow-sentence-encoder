Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the information described under the caption Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.  

OVERVIEW  

We are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products dedicated to the healthcare needs of women. Our core business segments are focused on Breast Health, Diagnostics, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health.  

Our Breast Health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) breast coils, computer-aided detection (CAD) for mammography and MRI, minimally invasive breast biopsy devices, breast biopsy site markers, breast biopsy guidance systems, breast imaging comfort pads, and breast brachytherapy products. We have also developed a new breast imaging platform, Dimensions, which utilizes a new technology, tomosynthesis, to produce three dimensional (3D) images, as well as conventional two dimensional (2D) full field digital mammography images. In the U.S., our Dimensions product had previously been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for providing conventional 2D images. On February 11, 2011, we received approval from the FDA to enable the 3D tomosynthesis capability of our Dimensions system. The FDA granted approval for the use of 3D tomosynthesis in addition to a conventional 2D digital image. Our clinical results for the approval demonstrated that conventional 2D digital mammography with the addition of 3D tomosynthesis is superior to 2D digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics. We began to sell our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system in the United States immediately following FDA approval. We had been selling Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis outside of the United States in regions such as Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia.  

In August 2010, we acquired Sentinelle Medical Inc. (Sentinelle Medical), a company that develops, manufactures and markets MRI coils (including MRI breast coils), patient positioners and visualization software (MRI CAD). Sentinelle Medical, which is included within our Breast Health segment, is dedicated to developing advanced imaging technologies used in high-field strength MRI systems. In July 2011, we completed our acquisition of Beijing Healthcome Technology Company, Ltd. (Healthcome), a privately-held manufacturer of medical equipment, including mammography equipment, located in Beijing, China. The operations of Sentinelle Medical and Healthcome have been integrated into our Breast Health segment.  

Our Diagnostics products include the ThinPrep System, which is primarily used in cytology applications such as cervical cancer screening, the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test, which assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth, and our molecular diagnostic reagents used for a variety of DNA and RNA analysis applications based on our proprietary Invader chemistry. Our current molecular diagnostic offerings based upon this Invader chemistry include Cervista HPV high risk (HR) and Cervista HPV 16/18 products to assist in the diagnosis of human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as other products to diagnose cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular risk and other diseases.  

In June, 2011, we acquired TCT International Co., Ltd. (TCT) and subsidiaries, a privately-held distributor of medical products, including the Companys ThinPrep Pap Test, related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products. TCTs operating subsidiaries are located in Beijing, China. Our acquisition of TCT provides us with an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in China. TCT is primarily reported within our Diagnostics segment and to a lesser extent within our GYN Surgical segment.  

Our GYN Surgical products include the NovaSure Endometrial Ablation System, the MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System, and the Adiana Permanent Contraception System. The NovaSure system is a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. The MyoSure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision-less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus. The  

44

 Adiana system is a form of permanent female contraception intended as an alternative to tubal ligation. The MyoSure system was added to the GYN Surgical product portfolio as a result of our acquisition of Interlace Medical, Inc. (Interlace) on January 6, 2011. The operations of Interlace have been integrated into our GYN Surgical segment.  

Our Skeletal Health products include dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry systems, an ultrasound-based osteoporosis assessment product, and our Fluoroscan mini C-arm imaging products.  

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  

Market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs, private insurers or other healthcare payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding worldwide financial markets and macroeconomic conditions has caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease or delay their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Additionally, constrictions in world credit markets have caused and continue to cause our customers to experience difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products. Economic uncertainty and unemployment have and may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness, which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. If the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.  

In March 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and imposes new and/or increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices beginning in 2013. We expect that our products will fall under the government classification requiring the excise tax. U.S. net product sales represented 76%, 79% and 80% of our worldwide net product sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

As we operate in a highly regulated industry, other governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including, without limitation: new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services; changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices; and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations, including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above.  

Professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have recently and in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. Recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products. A number of healthcare-related organizations and agencies have issued or proposed contrasting recommendations, and some of these current recommendations could significantly reduce the amount of screening using our ThinPrep, Cervista HPV, Selenia, Dimensions and related products and  

45  

Table of Contents 

 adversely affect the sale of those products. For example, in November 2009, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) changed their recommendations for pap smear screening, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed their recommendations for mammography screening, both of which recommended less frequent testing. However, in July 2011, ACOG changed its breast cancer screening guidelines recommending that mammography screening be offered annually to women beginning at age 40 instead of 50. In October 2011, the USPSTF published draft guidelines for public comment on cervical cancer screening in which they have recommended less frequent testing and no HPV co-testing.  

Recently, there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The ongoing fluctuations of the value of the U.S. dollar, including the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time. Historically, a majority of our capital equipment sales to international dealers have been denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have seen a shift of more sales being denominated in the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar for our Euro zone dealers. In addition, we have international sales, principally in our Diagnostics segment, that are denominated in foreign currencies. The value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar. Given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets, foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future, and if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results.  

ACQUISITIONS  

Fiscal 2011 Acquisitions:  

TCT International Co., Ltd.  

On June 1, 2011, we acquired TCT, a privately-held distributor of medical products, including our ThinPrep Pap Test, related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products. TCTs operating subsidiaries are located in Beijing, China. Our acquisition of TCT enabled us to obtain an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in China as we execute on our strategy to expand internationally. The preliminary purchase price of $147.3 million is comprised of $135.0 million in cash, of which $100.0 million was paid up-front and $35.0 million plus a working capital adjustment, which has been preliminarily estimated to be $13.0 million, are deferred for one year. These amounts may be subject to further adjustment. The deferred payment has been recorded on a present value basis of $47.3 million in purchase accounting to reflect fair value and such payment is being accreted through interest expense over this one year period. In addition, the majority of the former shareholders of TCT will receive two annual contingent earn-out payments (subject to adjustment) not to exceed $200.0 million less the deferred payment. Subsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of TCT, which are primarily reported within our Diagnostics reporting segment and to a lesser extent within our GYN Surgical reporting segment. We accounted for the TCT acquisition as a purchase of a business under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations.  

The allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 1, 2011. The purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of customer relationships of $41.8 million, business licenses of $2.5 million and trade names of $1.9 million, based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of $77.9 million.   

The contingent earn-out payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth for the one year periods beginning January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012 as compared to the respective prior year periods, and are payable after the first and second anniversaries from the date of acquisition, respectively. Since these payments are contingent on future employment, they are being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the required service periods, the first and second year anniversaries from the date of acquisition. Based on our revenue projections for the TCT business, we recorded compensation expense of $17.6 million in fiscal 2011.

Interlace Medical, Inc.  

On January 6, 2011, we acquired Interlace, a privately-held company located in Framingham, Massachusetts. Interlace is the developer, manufacturer and supplier of MyoSure. The purchase price was comprised of $126.8 million in cash (Initial Consideration), which was net of certain adjustments, plus two annual contingent payments up to a maximum of an additional $225.0 million in cash. Subsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of Interlace, which has been integrated within our GYN Surgical reporting segment. We accounted for the Interlace acquisition as a purchase of a business under ASC 805.  

The allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of January 6, 2011. The purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of developed technology of $158.7 million and trade names of $1.8 million, based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of $88.3 million.  

In addition to the Initial Consideration, $2.1 million was paid to certain employees upon the completion of three and six months of service from the date of acquisition. Since these payments were contingent on future employment, they were recognized as compensation expense.  

The agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of a portion of legal expenses in defense of the Interlace intellectual property. We have the right to collect certain amounts set aside in escrow from the Initial Consideration and, as applicable, offset contingent consideration payments of qualifying legal costs.  

The contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during a two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. Pursuant to ASC 805, we have recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability based on future revenue projections of the Interlace business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes. As of the date of acquisition, these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of 15.6%. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non-performance risk related to the liability pursuant to ASC 820. This analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of $86.6 million, which will be adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in fair value of the liability driven by the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. As of September 24, 2011, there were no significant changes in the estimated outcomes for the contingent consideration recognized. In connection with updating the fair value calculation for accretion as of September 24, 2011, we recorded a charge of $6.3 million in fiscal 2011 to record the liability at its fair value of $92.9 million.  

Beijing Healthcome Technology Company, Ltd.  

On July 19, 2011, we completed our acquisition of Healthcome, a privately-held manufacturer of medical equipment, including mammography equipment, located in Beijing, China. The purchase price was $9.8 million in cash, subject to adjustment, which is estimated to include a working capital reduction of $1.7 million. In addition, we are obligated to make future payments to the shareholders, who remain employed, up to an additional $7.1 million over three years. Since these payments are contingent on future employment, they are being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the respective service periods. Based on the terms of the contingent consideration arrangements, we recorded $0.3 million of compensation expense in fiscal 2011.  

47  

Table of Contents 

The allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of July 19, 2011. The purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of developed technology of $2.8 million, in-process research and development of $0.8 million and trade names of $0.2 million, based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of $5.8 million.   

Fiscal 2010 Acquisitions:  

Sentinelle Medical Inc.  

On August 5, 2010, we acquired Sentinelle Medical, a privately held company located in Toronto, Canada. The purchase price was comprised of an $84.8 million cash payment, which was net of certain adjustments, plus three contingent payments over a two-year period up to a maximum of an additional $250.0 million in cash. Subsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of Sentinelle Medical, which is a component of our Breast Health reporting segment. We accounted for the Sentinelle acquisition as a purchase of a business under ASC 805.  

The allocation of the purchase price was based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of August 5, 2010. The purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets aggregating $67.6 million, primarily comprised of developed technology of $60.9 million and in-process research and development projects of $4.8 million, based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of $48.6 million.  

The amount allocated to acquired in-process research and development represented the estimated fair value of in-process projects based on risk-adjusted cash flows utilizing a discount rate of 17%. These in-process projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses as of the date of the acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products. The acquired in-process research and development assets are not subject to amortization until the projects are complete, at which time, they will be amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. These projects relate to a prostate MRI coil and certain software. We received FDA approval for both projects in fiscal 2011.  

The contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. Pursuant to ASC 805, we have recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability based on future revenue projections of the Sentinelle Medical business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes. As of the date of acquisition, these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of 16.5%. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non-performance risk related to the liability pursuant to ASC 820. This analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of $29.5 million, which will be adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in fair value of the liability driven by the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820.  

During each quarter in fiscal 2011, we have re-evaluated our assumptions and updated the revenue and probability assumptions for future earn-out periods and lowered our projections. As a result of these adjustments, which were partially offset by the accretion of the liability using a current discount rate of approximately 17.0%, we recorded a reversal of expense of $14.3 million in fiscal 2011 to record the contingent consideration liability at fair value. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the first earn-out period ended, and we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for actual results during the earn-out period. This payment of $4.3 million was made in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. At September 24, 2011, the fair value of the liability is $10.9 million.

Table of Contents 

Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 25, 2010  

Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2011, our product sales increased $63.4 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in revenues of $24.5 million from Breast Health, $17.8 million from GYN Surgical, $17.5 million from Diagnostics, and $3.7 million from Skeletal Health.  

Breast Health product sales increased 5% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in our breast biopsy products of $16.8 million, the inclusion of a full year of revenues from Sentinelle Medical (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010), which increased $12.9 million, and a favorable foreign currency impact of $3.4 million. The increase in breast biopsy products revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of Eviva biopsy devices sold with the largest increase in the U.S. Overall, our digital mammography systems revenues decreased $2.9 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. We experienced a decrease in the number of Selenia systems sold worldwide, and to a lesser extent, Selenia product mix and configuration differences resulted in lower revenues in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. We sold a greater number of our Selenia value-related models and a lesser amount of our full featured Selenia models in fiscal 2011. Our value-related models have lower average selling prices than our full featured Selenia models. In addition, we sold more Selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total Selenia systems and average selling prices are lower in our international markets compared to the domestic market. Mostly offsetting these decreases was an increase in the number of units sold of our new 2D/3D Dimensions products as these systems continue to gain traction. These systems also have higher average selling prices than our Selenia systems. We expect the shift in sales from our Selenia to our Dimensions products to continue as we received FDA approval of our 3D tomosynthesis capability in February 2011.  

Diagnostics product sales increased 3% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in revenues from our Cervista HPV tests, the inclusion of TCT (acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011) resulting in incremental revenues of approximately $10 million, a favorable foreign currency impact of $5.2 million and to a lesser extent an increase in the number of ThinPrep pap tests sold internationally, partially offset by a reduction in domestic sales. Cervista HPV revenues have increased as we continue to gain new customer accounts and unit sales to existing customers increase. We believe the decline in the number of ThinPrep pap tests sold domestically is due to the decline in patient visits year over year attributable to the lagging effects of unemployment, continuing economic uncertainty, recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines to extend the recommended intervals between such screenings, and to a lesser extent laboratory consolidation.  

GYN Surgical product sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in the number of Adiana systems sold and the inclusion of MyoSure system sales (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2011). NovaSure system sales were essentially flat year over year. While we experienced an increase in the number of NovaSure devices sold internationally and to a lesser extent a slight increase in average selling prices, these increases were offset by a decline in the number of NovaSure devices sold domestically. We believe the decline in units sold domestically is due to the lagging effects of unemployment and continuing economic uncertainty, which has resulted in patients delaying surgery and opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives.  

50  

Table of Contents 

Skeletal Health product sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in osteoporosis assessment product sales worldwide. Offsetting this increase in fiscal 2011 was a reduction in mini C-arm revenues of $2.1 million due to a decrease in the number of units sold domestically and slightly lower average selling prices in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.  

In fiscal 2011, 76% of product sales were generated in the United States, 13% in Europe, 6% in Asia-Pacific, and 5% in other international markets. In fiscal 2010, 79% of product sales were generated in the United States, 12% in Europe, 5% in Asia-Pacific, and 4% in other international markets.  

Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. Service and other revenues increased 18% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily in our Breast Health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our digital mammography systems, which are no longer under warranty.  

Cost of Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Product sales gross margin increased to 53% in fiscal 2011 compared to 45% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the significant intangible asset charge of $123.4 million recorded in fiscal 2010 related to MammoSite.  

Cost of Product Sales. The cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was 35% in fiscal 2011 compared to 34% in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased in Breast Health compared to fiscal 2010 and was relatively flat in Diagnostics, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health compared to fiscal 2010. The decline in Breast Health gross margin in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to $2.7 million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired Sentinelle Medical inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting, unfavorable absorption and higher production spend principally in the digital mammography product lines, and a mix shift in sales of our Selenia product line. Our Selenia value-related models have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our full featured Selenia models. In addition, we sold more Selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total Selenia systems, where our average selling prices are lower. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher sales of Dimensions 3D and 3D tomosynthesis software upgrades. The Dimensions 3D product has a higher average selling price and gross margin compared to  

51  

Table of Contents 

 our full-featured Selenia models. Within our breast biopsy products, the mix of products sold resulted in lower gross margins as we sold more Eviva disposables and less ATEC disposables as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2010. Eviva disposables have a lower gross margin than our ATEC disposables because they have a higher manufacturing cost and carry additional royalty charges.  

Cost of Product SalesAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8.5 and 20 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the inclusion of additional amortization expense related to the technology assets acquired from the Sentinelle Medical and Interlace acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and second quarter of fiscal 2011, respectively. In addition, there was an increase in amortization expense in the current year due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets, primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Offsetting this increase was a decline in amortization expense in fiscal 2011 related to our MammoSite reporting unit. We recorded an impairment charge for its developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, as discussed below, resulting in a reduced asset value and lower future amortization expense.  

Cost of Product SalesImpairment of Intangible Assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in connection with our Company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, we identified indicators of impairment in our MammoSite reporting unit due to changing market conditions for the breast brachytherapy market, including downward pressure on procedure volumes from the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and current trends in breast cancer management, as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies. These factors resulted in lowering our financial projections for MammoSite. We performed the first step in the long-lived assets impairment test and compared MammoSites forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets, which indicated that these cash flows were insufficient to recover MammoSites carrying value. Therefore, we determined the fair value of MammoSites long-lived assets, which are primarily intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow technique. Based on the fair value of the long-lived assets, we recorded an impairment charge of $123.4 million to developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For additional information, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Cost of Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues gross margin has improved to 46% in fiscal 2011 compared to 39% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the improved absorption of fixed service costs and the continued growth of service contract revenue, primarily in the Breast Health business. We have been able to convert a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon the expiration of the warranty period. In addition, warranty costs have decreased due to lower failure rates in certain of our products.

Operating Expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of additional expenses from Sentinelle Medical (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010) and Interlace (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2011). In the current year, compensation and benefits increased due to an increase in headcount, annual salary increases, and higher bonuses based on improved company performance compared to the prior year. In addition, there was an increase in clinical trials and research projects spend primarily attributable to next generation NovaSure and Adiana products, partially offset by a reduction in clinical trial and project spend on the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis product, which was approved by the FDA in February 2011. Research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary period to period.  

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 16% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of Sentinelle Medical, Interlace and TCT, expenditures for our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign for the NovaSure system, higher spending for other marketing and advertising initiatives including the Dimensions 3D product launch, increased compensation and benefits related to an increase in headcount, annual salary increases and higher bonuses based on improved company performance compared to the prior year, and medical education. Partially offsetting these increases were lower distributor and third-party commissions.  

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of Sentinelle Medical, Interlace and TCT, an increase in compensation and benefits primarily due to an increase in headcount, annual salary increases, higher bonuses due to improved company performance compared to the prior year, and additional expenses related to consummating our acquisitions and integrating them into our operations, including  

53  

Table of Contents 

 accounting and tax services. In the current year, these increases were partially offset by a decrease in litigation costs due to lower activity compared to fiscal 2010, in which a number of matters were resolved, primarily the Ethicon lawsuit.  

Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, business licenses and non-compete agreements related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. The increase in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is due to the addition of intangible assets from the Sentinelle Medical, Interlace and TCT acquisitions, and an increase in amortization due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets, primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  

Contingent ConsiderationCompensation Expense. In connection with our recent acquisitions, we are obligated to make contingent earn-out payments. Amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment. These payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones, typically incremental revenue growth, as is the case for TCT. The amounts recorded related to Interlace and Healthcome are solely related to continuing employment. In fiscal 2011, we recorded an aggregate charge of $20.0 million comprised of $17.6 million, $2.1 million and $0.3 million related to TCT, Interlace and Healthcome, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Contingent ConsiderationFair Value Adjustments. In connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisitions of Sentinelle Medical and Interlace, we recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for each acquisition as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This liability is not contingent on future employment and is based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes. This analysis is updated quarterly and changes to the fair value of this liability are recorded in the statements of operations. As a result, we recorded a net credit of $8.0 million in fiscal 2011 reflecting a net decrease in the fair values of these liabilities comprised of reduction in the fair value of the Sentinelle Medical liability of $14.3 million due primarily to changes in revenue assumptions offset by a charge of $6.3 million related to Interlace based primarily on the accretion of the liability to the expected payment amount. For additional information, refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Impairment of Goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, in connection with performing our Company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process, we determined that there were indicators of impairment related to our MammoSite reporting unit, and we recorded intangible asset impairment charges discussed above and below. The fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal 2009 primarily due to our reassessment of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and a reduction in long-term growth projections. After determining the fair values of MammoSites long-lived assets, other than goodwill, and writing these assets down to their fair values, we performed the 2-step goodwill impairment test for MammoSite. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a $76.7 million goodwill impairment charge. No other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal 2010. For additional information, refer to Note 2Intangible Assets and Goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Impairment of Intangible Assets. As noted above under Cost of Product SalesImpairment of Intangible Assets, in fiscal 2010, we determined that the long-lived assets in the MammoSite reporting unit were impaired. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a $20.1 million charge in fiscal 2010 to write down customer relationships and trade name intangible assets to their fair values. For additional information, refer to Note 2Intangible Assets and Goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.

Gain on Sale of Intellectual Property, Net. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we received FDA approval of Makena, formerly known as Gestiva, and all rights to Makena were transferred to K-V Pharmaceutical Company (KV) pursuant to our agreement in which we sold the exclusive worldwide rights of Makena to KV. Upon transfer, we received $12.5 million, and including the $79.5 million received in prior years, we recorded a gain on the sale of intellectual property, net of the write-off of certain assets, of $84.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. For additional information on this arrangement and amounts we may receive in the future, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Litigation Settlement Charges, Net. In fiscal 2011, we incurred a charge of $0.8 million relating to the settlement of three insignificant cases. In fiscal 2010, we incurred litigation settlement charges of $11.4 million primarily relating to our litigation with Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (Ethicon). We had been engaged in litigation in which Ethicon had alleged patent infringement by our ATEC biopsy system of certain of their patents, and Ethicon had made similar claims of our Eviva biopsy system. On February 17, 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with Ethicon, and all outstanding litigation between the parties was dismissed. In connection with the settlement agreement, we agreed to make a one-time payment to Ethicon of $12.5 million and ongoing royalties for sales of our ATEC and Eviva products, and Ethicon agreed to pay us ongoing royalties for sales of its Mammotome magnetic resonance imaging product.  

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired certain assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a $2.0 million charge within our Diagnostics segment.  

Restructuring and Divestiture Charges, Net. During the fourth quarter we terminated the employment of certain employees and recorded a severance benefits charge of $0.3 million, which was offset by a gain of $0.4 million related to the sale of an insignificant product line. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we terminated the employment of certain employees in connection with completing the Sentinelle Medical acquisition and recorded severance and related benefit costs of $0.9 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the capital stock of our organic photoconductor drum coating manufacturing operation in Shanghai, China for a net sales price of $3.8 million resulting in a loss on disposal of $0.3 million. As a result of previously closing this facility, we incurred additional net charges of $0.4 million in fiscal 2010.  

Interest Income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest income increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents.  

Interest Expense.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2011, interest expense consists primarily of the interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount of our Convertible Notes as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs. In fiscal 2010, in  

55  

Table of Contents 

 addition to the interest expense related to our Convertible Notes, we incurred interest costs and the amortization of deferred financing costs related to our senior secured credit agreement. The amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement were paid off in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, and we terminated the agreement.  

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, pursuant to separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements, we retired $450.0 million in aggregate principal of our Convertible Notes for $450.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037. This exchange enabled us to extend the first put date three years to December 15, 2016 from December 13, 2013 as well as the subsequent put dates as disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In consideration, the equity conversion price of the notes was reduced to $23.03 from $38.60, and we must pay the cash coupon for three more years, consistent with extending the first put date, instead of accreting the coupon to the principal as required under the original terms. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $29.9 million, which includes the write-off of the pro-rata allocation of deferred financing costs. For additional information, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

Other (Expense) Income, net.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2011, this account is primarily comprised of impairment charges of $2.4 million for cost-method investments, net foreign currency transaction losses of $1.1 million and a loss on cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) of $0.8 million, which is driven by the underlying changes in the stock market. In fiscal 2010, this account was primarily comprised of an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our DCP of $1.3 million and an increase related to non-income tax related government credits of $0.8 million partially offset by an impairment charge of $1.1 million for a cost-method investment.  

Provision for Income Taxes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 30.9% of pre-tax earnings compared to 14.2% of the pre-tax loss in fiscal 2010. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was less than the statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of income tax reserves, the Section 199 manufacturing deduction for domestic production activities, and U.S. and  

56  

Table of Contents 

 Canadian research and development tax credits. The reversal of $9.1 million of income tax reserves was due to the closure of the United States Internal Revenue Service federal audit for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the expiration of the statute of limitations in various domestic (federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was significantly impacted by the $76.7 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter, substantially all of which was not deductible for tax purposes.  

We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 48% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2012.  

Segment Results of Operations  

We report our business as four segments: Breast Health, Diagnostics, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss. Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.  

Breast Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a $45.5 million increase in service revenues that is substantially related to additional service contracts for the increased number of digital mammography systems in our installed base and the increase in product revenues of $24.5 million discussed above.  

Operating income for this business segment increased $281.6 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a $220.2 million intangible asset and goodwill impairment charge related to our MammoSite reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 discussed above. The balance of the increase in fiscal 2011, $61.4 million, was primarily due to increased gross margin on an absolute dollar basis as a result of higher product and service revenues as discussed above and lower operating expenses. Overall the gross margin rate as a percentage of revenues increased to 49.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to 30.7% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the $123.4 million impairment charge to MammoSites developed technology included in fiscal 2010. In addition, in fiscal 2011, there have been improvements in service gross margins and lower intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the write-off of MammoSite intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, overall gross margin, excluding the impact of the MammoSite impairment charge, was 47.0%.  

Operating expenses for this business segment decreased $108.8 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact of the goodwill and intangible asset charge of $96.8 million recorded in operating expenses in fiscal 2010. Other operating expense decreases in fiscal 2011 included a net credit of $14.3 million related to adjusting the Sentinelle Medical contingent consideration to fair value, lower clinical trials spending related to our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system, lower third-party commissions, lower intangible asset amortization from the write-off of MammoSite intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and a decrease in litigation costs. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a litigation settlement charge of $12.5 million as discussed above. Partially offsetting these operating expense decreases was the inclusion of a  

57  

Table of Contents 

 full year of expenses for Sentinelle Medical (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010), and higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel, annual salary increases, higher bonuses due to improved company performance and higher sales commissions for our breast biopsy business.  

Diagnostics.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

Operating income increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the net gain of $84.5 million on the sale of the Makena intellectual property to KV in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 discussed above and an increase in gross margin in absolute dollars due to higher revenues. Gross margin rates were 53.9% and 53.4% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to the inclusion of TCT (acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011) and related integration costs and contingent consideration compensation expense of $17.6 million, and higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel, annual salary increases, and higher bonuses due to improved company performance.  

GYN Surgical.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GYN Surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

Operating income decreased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the inclusion of Interlaces operations (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2011), including intangible asset amortization expense, a charge of $6.3 million to adjust the Interlace contingent consideration liability to fair value and a charge of $2.1 million to record Interlace contingent consideration compensation expense as payments were tied to continuing employment. Overall, gross margin in absolute dollars decreased slightly in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This segments gross margin rates declined to 56.8% compared to 61.0% in fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization expense. In addition, this segment incurred higher operating expenses, principally in sales and marketing for increased advertising of the Novasure system, including expenditures related to our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, an increase in compensation and benefits related to hiring additional personnel, annual salary increases, and higher bonuses due to improved company performance, increased amortization expense from intangible assets, and higher project expense on the development of next generation products. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2010 included the reversal of stock compensation due to the departure of a senior executive.

Skeletal Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Skeletal Health revenues increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

Operating income increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in revenues and improvement in gross margin rates to 43.5% compared to 42.4% in the prior year. Operating expenses remained relatively flat.  

Fiscal Year Ended September 25, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 26, 2009  

Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2010, our product sales decreased $12.1 million, or 1%, compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a decrease of $27.4 million in our Breast Health products and to a lesser extent a $7.5 million decline in Skeletal Health products partially offset by increases in GYN Surgical and Diagnostic products of $18.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively.  

Breast Health product sales decreased 5% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $13.9 million decline in digital mammography systems revenues principally due to product mix as we sold a greater number of defeatured Selenia systems, which have lower average selling prices than our full featured models, a shift to a higher level of international sales, and to a lesser extent, we experienced slight pressure on average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of units sold of our new 2D/3D Dimensions systems. The decline in revenue is also due to phasing out the supply of digital detectors to an OEM and closing our AEG organic photoconductor drum coatings manufacturing operations in Shanghai, which in aggregate accounted for $17.5 million in revenues in fiscal 2009. These decreases were partially offset by a $9.3 million increase in revenues due to higher volumes of our breast biopsy products, offset in part by a slight reduction in average selling prices for these products. We also generated $2.4 million in revenues from sales of MRI breast coils through our acquisition of Sentinelle Medical in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.  

Diagnostics product sales increased 1% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in sales of our Cervista HPV tests, and to a lesser extent other molecular tests. Partially offsetting these increases  

59  

Table of Contents 

 was a decrease in ThinPrep pap test volume domestically due to the decline in doctor visits, which we believe is attributable to the lagging effects of unemployment, continuing economic uncertainty and recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines to extend the recommended intervals between such screenings, and the discontinuance of certain molecular ASRs, which contributed $3.5 million of revenue in 2009. In addition, we have seen laboratory consolidation, which impacts our average selling prices due to volume purchase discounts to the larger laboratories.  

GYN Surgical product sales increased 7% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to growing sales of the Adiana system, which was approved by the FDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the number of NovaSure products sold. We also experienced a slight increase in the NovaSure system average selling prices.  

Skeletal Health product sales decreased 11% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a decrease in mini C-arms sales of $4.6 million as a result of a reduction in the number of units sold. In addition, there was a $3.6 million decrease in osteoporosis assessment product sales principally due to a decrease in the number of bone densitometry systems sold worldwide. This product line has experienced a difficult capital equipment environment worldwide and the ongoing effects of the reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis exams in the U.S.  

In fiscal 2010, approximately 79% of product sales were generated in the United States, 12% in Europe, 5% in Asia, and 4% in other international markets. In fiscal 2009, approximately 80% of product sales were generated in the United States, 12% in Europe, 4% in Asia, and 4% in other international markets.  

Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. Service and other revenues increased 26% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily in our Breast Health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our full field digital mammography systems.  

Cost of Product Sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Product sales gross margin decreased to 45% in fiscal 2010 compared to 56% in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the significant intangible asset impairment charge of $123.4 million recorded in fiscal 2010.  

60  

Table of Contents 

Cost of Product Sales. The cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal 2010 was 34% compared to 33% in fiscal 2009. Cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased across our business segments, except Skeletal Health which remained relatively flat with the prior year. The decline in gross margin in fiscal 2010 was driven by a shift in product mix of our Selenia digital mammography systems to lower margin configurations, a higher level of international sales, and a slight reduction in average selling prices in our Breast Health segment. In addition, we experienced unfavorable manufacturing variances related to our Adiana System and lower absorption of manufacturing costs.  

Cost of Product SalesAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. The increase in amortization in fiscal 2010 was due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets, and was primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  

Cost of Product SalesImpairment of Intangible Assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in connection with our Company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our MammoSite reporting unit due to changing market conditions for the breast brachytherapy market, including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and current trends in breast cancer management, as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies. These factors resulted in lowering our financial projections for MammoSite. We performed the first step in the long-lived assets impairment test and compared MammoSites forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets, which indicated that these cash flows were insufficient to recover MammoSites carrying value. Therefore, we determined the fair value of MammoSites long-lived assets, which were primarily intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow technique. Based on the fair value of the long-lived assets, we recorded an impairment charge of $123.4 million to developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we decided to discontinue selling a certain product acquired in the Third Wave acquisition, which was an indicator of impairment, and therefore, we performed an impairment test. Due to the insufficient cash flows to be generated, we determined that the related asset groups fair value was de minimus and recorded an impairment charge of $4.1 million comprised of developed technology of $2.6 million and capitalized license fees of $1.5 million.  

Cost of Service and Other Revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service and other revenues gross margin improved to 39% in fiscal 2010 from 25% in fiscal 2009 due in part to the improved absorption of fixed service costs as a result of the continued growth of service contract revenue, primarily in the Breast Health business. We have been able to convert a high percentage of our domestic installed base of full field digital mammography systems to service contracts upon the expiration of the warranty period.

Operating Expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to an increase in clinical trial costs, primarily related to our tomosynthesis product, the addition of expenses from Sentinelle Medical since August 5, 2010 (the acquisition date), compensation and benefits, and engineering programs for a number of projects for product enhancements and new products. These increases were offset in part by a reduction of pre-release production costs that were incurred in fiscal 2009 related to the Adiana System that are no longer being incurred due to its FDA approval and commercial release in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.  

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 4% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher distributor and third-party commissions, additional expenses related to recently released products, trade shows and website marketing partially offset by lower compensation and expenditures for advertising and medical education.  

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 5% primarily due to higher legal fees related to increased litigation related activities, principally the Ethicon and SenoRx lawsuits, and higher employee compensation and benefits principally due to a transition payment to the former CEO of $1.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and related continuing retention compensation, an increase in the value of our DCP, and increased bonuses, offset slightly by lower costs from the departure of certain employees that were not replaced. In addition, transaction costs related to acquisitions are now recorded as an expense and not capitalized as part of the purchase price, increasing general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by lower fees for accounting, tax and other consulting services, lower bad debt expense, and lower charges for the write-off of certain corporate-related fixed assets in fiscal 2010.  

Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed.  

Impairment of Goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, in connection with performing our Company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process, we determined that indicators of impairment existed in  

62  

Table of Contents 

 our MammoSite reporting unit and recorded intangible asset impairment charges. The fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal 2009 primarily due to our reassessment of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and a reduction in long-term growth projections. After determining the fair values of MammoSites long-lived assets, other than goodwill, and writing these assets down to their fair values, we performed the 2-step goodwill impairment test for MammoSite. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a $76.7 million goodwill impairment charge. No other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, based upon a combination of factors, including the deteriorating macro-economic environment, declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets, we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of December 27, 2008. As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of December 27, 2008. Step 1 of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain of our reporting units, acquired in connection with the Cytyc acquisition, exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units. As a result, we were required to complete Step 2 of the impairment analysis to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment charges. We completed Step 2 of this analysis during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.34 billion in the three month period ended March 28, 2009. Refer to Note 2Intangible Assets and Goodwill contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information.  

Impairment of Intangible Assets. As noted above under Cost of Product SalesImpairment of Intangible Assets, we determined that the long-lived assets in the MammoSite reporting unit were impaired. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a $20.1 million charge to write down customer relationships and trade name intangible assets to their fair values. Refer to Note 2Intangible Assets and Goodwill contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information.  

Litigation Settlement Charges, Net. These charges are primarily comprised of our litigation with Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. We had been engaged in litigation in which Ethicon had alleged patent infringement by our ATEC biopsy system of certain of their patents, and Ethicon had made similar claims of our Eviva biopsy system. On February 17, 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with Ethicon, and all outstanding litigation between the parties was dismissed. In connection with the settlement agreement, we agreed to make a one-time payment to Ethicon of $12.5 million and ongoing royalties for sales of our ATEC and Eviva products, and Ethicon agreed to pay us ongoing royalties for sales of its Mammotome magnetic resonance imaging product.  

Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired certain assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a $2.0 million charge within our Diagnostics segment.  

Restructuring and Divestiture Charges. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we terminated the employment of certain employees in connection with completing the Sentinelle Medical acquisition and recorded severance and related benefit costs of $0.9 million. The terminations occurred prior to September 25, 2010. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the capital stock of our organic photoconductor drum coating manufacturing operation in Shanghai, China for a net sales price of $3.8 million resulting in a loss on disposal of $0.3 million. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we closed this manufacturing operation due to Chinese government requirements to move the facility. In connection with this action, we recorded restructuring costs for severance benefits and other costs of $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we incurred clean-up and closure costs of $0.4 million, net.  

Interest Income.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

63  

Table of Contents 

Interest income increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in invested balances partially offset by a decline in interest rates.  

Interest Expense.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense consists primarily of the interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount of our 2.00% Convertible Notes as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs. In fiscal 2010, we adopted a new accounting standard, FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1) (codified within Accounting Standards Codification 470, Debt), that changed the accounting for convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features and required us to allocate a portion of our Convertible Notes to equity based on the relative fair value of the embedded conversion feature in our Convertible Notes. This component is recorded as a debt discount and is amortized to interest expense. This new accounting standard was retrospectively applied to prior periods (see Note 5(a) contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for additional information). In addition, we incurred interest costs and the related amortization of deferred financing costs of our senior secured credit agreement. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to paying down the outstanding principal amounts under our senior secured credit agreement, which were fully paid off in the third quarter of this year, partially offset by higher overall interest expense on our Convertible Notes due to using the effective interest method to amortize the debt discount.  

Other Income (Expense), net.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In fiscal 2010, this account was primarily comprised of an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our DCP of $1.3 million, which is driven by changes in stock market valuation, an increase related to non-income tax related government credits of $0.8 million partially offset by the write-off of a cost-method investment of $1.1 million due to an other-than-temporary impairment charge. In fiscal 2009, this account was primarily comprised of other-than-temporary impairment charges of cost-method investments of $2.2 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $2.3 million, offset by a $0.7 million increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our DCP.  

Provision for Income Taxes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 14.2% of the pre-tax loss compared to 2.9% of the pre-tax loss in fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was significantly impacted by the $76.7 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter, substantially all of which was not deductible for tax purposes.

Segment Results of Operations  

The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.  

Breast Health.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $54.1 million increase in service revenues that is substantially related to additional service contracts for the increased number of Selenia systems in our installed base partially offset by the decrease in product revenues of $27.4 million discussed above.  

The operating loss for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $220.2 million intangible asset and goodwill impairment charge related to our MammoSite reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the $265.9 million goodwill impairment charge related to our MammoSite reporting unit recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, operating income decreased $16.8 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the $12.5 million litigation settlement charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 for the settlement of the Ethicon matter discussed above. Overall, our gross margins declined significantly to 31% due to the intangible asset impairment charge to write down developed technology related to our MammoSite reporting unit. Excluding this impairment, gross margins were relatively flat at 47% in both fiscal 2010 and 2009. Gross margin was positively impacted by an improved service revenues gross margin as a result of our relatively fixed cost structure to support service contracts, which was partially offset by a reduction in product gross margin to 54% from 58% in fiscal 2009 primarily due to a shift in product mix of our Selenia digital mammography systems to lower margin configurations, a higher level of international sales, and slight pressure on average selling prices. In addition, the increase in service revenues, which have lower gross margins than product sales, resulted in overall lower gross margins. The fiscal 2010 operating loss included higher clinical trial expenses principally related to clinical trials for our tomosynthesis product, increased litigation costs and higher third-party commissions compared to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 also included Sentinelle Medical operating expenses and acquisition related transaction costs and charges aggregating approximately $5.0 million.

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to product sales discussed above.  

Operating income for this business segment in fiscal 2010 increased compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $908.3 million goodwill impairment charge and a $4.1 million intangible asset charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of these charges, operating income was essentially flat in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to lower operating expenses, which declined $7.5 million, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin to 53% from 55%. Gross margin declined primarily due to lower absorption of manufacturing costs as a result of lower volumes of ThinPrep, and higher intangible asset amortization expense. Gross margin in fiscal 2009 included a $4.1 million intangible asset charge. Operating expenses declined primarily due to lower legal expenses, lower employee compensation and benefits as a result of the departure of certain senior personnel. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 included an acquired in-process research and development charge of $2.0 million for the acquisition of certain assets which had no future alternative use.  

GYN Surgical.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GYN Surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above.  

The operating loss in this segment in fiscal 2009 included a $1.17 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, operating income in fiscal 2010 decreased $15.1 million compared to fiscal 2009 due to a reduction in gross margin to 61% from 67% and higher operating expenses of $10.6 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing variances related to the Adiana System, higher manufacturing and material costs related to our next generation NovaSure product and higher intangible asset amortization expense. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation costs for sales and marketing personnel as a result of an increase in headcount, higher commissions driven by an increase in revenues, and higher intangible asset amortization expense. In addition, we had higher Adiana System product launch activities as FDA approval was received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.  

Skeletal Health.

Skeletal Health revenues decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the decline in product sales discussed above.

Operating income for this business segment decreased primarily due to lower sales and higher operating expenses. Gross margin in fiscal 2010 was relatively flat at 42% compared to 41% in fiscal 2009.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

At September 24, 2011, we had $833.5 million of working capital, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $712.3 million. Our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $196.7 million during fiscal 2011 due to cash generated from our operations partially offset by cash used in investing activities primarily for the purchase of Interlace, TCT and Healthcome, capital expenditures and placement of equipment under customer usage agreements, and the payment of contingent consideration.  

Our operating activities provided us with $456.0 million of cash, which included net income of $157.2 million increased by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of an aggregate $304.7 million, non-cash interest expense of $76.8 million related to our convertible notes, the loss on extinguishment of debt of $29.9 million related to the exchange of convertible notes, and stock-based compensation expense of $35.5 million. These adjustments to net income were partially offset by the gain on the sale of intellectual property, net, of $84.5 million, a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $48.1 million primarily the result of amortization of intangible assets, and $8.0 million to record fair value adjustments to contingent consideration related to recent acquisitions. Cash provided by operations included a net cash outflow of $13.2 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in inventory of $32.2 million due to an increase in components on hand to support higher sales volume, the introduction of new products and last-time buys of certain components, an increase of accounts receivable of $17.1 million due to an increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, and a $6.2 million increase in prepaid income taxes. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was an increase in accrued expenses of $40.6 million primarily due to compensation accruals and timing of payments.  

During fiscal 2011, we used $266.6 million of cash in investing activities. This use of cash was primarily attributable to the purchase of Interlace, TCT and Healthcome aggregating net payments of $198.7 million, the payment of contingent consideration to the former shareholders of Adiana of $19.7 million and an aggregate of $55.7 million for the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchases of property and equipment, which consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment and computer hardware. In addition, we also purchased $5.3 million of life insurance contracts to fund future payments under our DCP. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $13.3 million of proceeds from the sale of intellectual property assets, primarily related to the finalization of the Makena sale to KV. We received $12.5 million from KV in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. For additional explanation of this arrangement, please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

During fiscal 2011, our financing activities provided us with $7.7 million of cash. This increase in cash was primarily attributable to proceeds of $25.4 million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the payment of $10.4 million of employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units, the payment of issuance costs of $5.3 million related to our $450 million Exchange Notes (discussed below) and contingent consideration of $4.3 million paid to the former shareholders of Sentinelle Medical. Under ASC 805, the payment of contingent consideration is treated as a financing activity to the extent of the amount recorded in purchase accounting.  

Debt  

We had total recorded debt outstanding of $1.49 billion at September 24, 2011, which is primarily comprised of our Convertible Notes (principal $1.725 billion).

Convertible Notes.  

Original Convertible Notes. On December 10, 2007, we issued and sold $1.725 billion, at par, of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (Original Notes). The net proceeds from the offering was approximately $1.69 billion, after deducting the underwriters discounts and estimated offering expenses and was used to repay a portion of our then outstanding senior secured indebtedness under our Credit Agreement. At September 24, 2011, the Original Notes are recorded at $1.49 billion, which is net of the unamortized debt discount attributed to the embedded conversion feature of the Original Notes in accordance with FSP APB 14-1. See Note 5(a) contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information. On November 18, 2010, we entered into separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements under which we retired $450.0 million in aggregate principal of our Original Notes for $450.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037 (Exchange Notes). Following these transactions, $1.275 billion in principal amount of the Original Notes remain outstanding.  

Holders may require us to repurchase the Original Notes on December 13, 2013, and on each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032, or upon a fundamental change, as described in the First Supplemental Indenture, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem any of the Original Notes beginning December 18, 2013, by giving holders at least 30 days notice. We may redeem the Original Notes either in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and liquidated damages, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.  

The Original Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2008, and ending on December 15, 2013 and will accrete principal from December 15, 2013 at a rate that provides holders with an aggregate annual yield to maturity of 2.00% per year. Beginning with the six month interest period commencing December 15, 2013, we will pay contingent interest during any six month interest period to the holders of Original Notes if the trading price, as defined, of the Original Notes for each of the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the accreted principal amount of the Original Notes. The holders of the Original Notes may convert the Original Notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately $38.60 per share, subject to adjustment, prior to the close of business on September 15, 2037, subject to prior redemption or repurchase of the Original Notes, under any of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2007 if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (3) if the Original Notes have been called for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these triggering events had occurred as of September 24, 2011.  

In lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the Original Notes, we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in cash, we will deliver cash in an amount as provided in the indenture for the Original Notes. If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, we will deliver up to a specified dollar amount of cash per $1,000 original principal amount of Original Notes, and will settle the remainder of our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock, in each case based on the daily conversion value calculated as provided in the indenture for the Original Notes. In addition, at any time on or prior to the 35th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the Original Notes, we may make an irrevocable election to settle conversions of the Original Notes either solely in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with a specified cash amount at least equal to the accreted principal amount of the Original Notes. This net share settlement election is in our sole discretion and does not require the consent of holders of the Original Notes. It is our current intent and policy to settle any conversion of the Original Notes as if we had elected to make the net share settlement election.

The Original Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and prior to all future subordinated debt. The Original Notes are effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries.  

Exchange Convertible Notes. On November 18, 2010, pursuant to separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements, we retired $450.0 million in aggregate principal of our Original Notes for $450.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037 (Exchange Notes).  

Holders may require us to repurchase the Exchange Notes on December 15, 2016, and on each of December 15, 2020, December 15, 2025, December 13, 2030 and December 14, 2035 or upon a fundamental change, as described in the Second Supplemental Indenture, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem any of the notes beginning December 19, 2016, by giving holders at least 30 days notice. We may redeem the Exchange Notes either in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and liquidated damages, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.  

The Exchange Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2010, and ending on December 15, 2016 and will accrete principal from December 15, 2016 at a rate that provides holders with an aggregate annual yield to maturity of 2.00% per year. Beginning with the six month interest period commencing December 15, 2016, we will pay contingent interest during any six month interest period to the holders of Exchange Notes if the trading price, as defined, of the Exchange Notes for each of the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the accreted principal amount of the Exchange Notes. The holders of the Exchange Notes may convert the Exchange Notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately $23.03 per share, subject to adjustment, prior to the close of business on September 15, 2037, subject to prior redemption or repurchase of the Exchange Notes, under any of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2010 if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (3) if the Exchange Notes have been called for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these triggering events had occurred as of September 24, 2011.  

In lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the Exchange Notes, we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in cash, we will deliver cash in an amount as provided in the indenture for the Exchange Notes.

Contingent Earn-Out Payments.  

In connection with our acquisitions, we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earnout payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period. In certain circumstances, such as a change of control, a portion of these obligations may be accelerated. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earnout obligations may include covenants to operate the businesses acquired in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us.  

Our contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments. Pursuant to ASC 805, contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration the Company expects to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date. This liability is remeasured each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded through a separate line item within the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in discount rates, and changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates. Contingent consideration arrangements from acquisitions completed prior to the adoption of ASC 805 (effective in fiscal 2010 for us) that are deemed to be part of the purchase price of the acquisition are not subject to the fair value measurement requirements of ASC 805 and are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill.  

We have an obligation to the former Adiana, Inc. shareholders to make contingent payments tied to the achievement of milestones. The contingent payments of up to $155.0 million are based on worldwide sales of the Adiana system in the first year following FDA approval and on annual incremental sales growth thereafter through December 31, 2012. FDA approval of the Adiana system occurred on July 6, 2009, and we began accruing contingent consideration in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 based on the defined percentage of worldwide sales of the product. Since this contingent consideration obligation arose from an acquisition prior to the adoption of ASC 805, the amounts accrued are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill and the obligation is not remeasured each reporting period through the statement of operations. The agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of qualifying legal expenses and liabilities associated with legal claims against the Adiana products and intellectual property, and we have the right to offset contingent consideration payments to the Adiana shareholders with these qualifying legal costs. We have been in litigation with Conceptus regarding certain intellectual property matters related to the Adiana product and are recording legal fees incurred for this litigation matter (described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report) as a reduction to the accrued contingent consideration payments, which will result in a lower payment to the Adiana shareholders. We made a payment of $19.7 million to the Adiana shareholders in October 2010, net of amounts withheld for the legal indemnification provision. At September 24, 2011, the accrued contingent consideration obligation is $27.4 million, which is net of qualifying legal costs incurred. On October 17, 2011, the jury returned a verdict in the Conceptus litigation matter in favor of Conceptus and awarded damages in the amount of $18.8 million. This amount is included within, and may be offset against, the $27.4 million accrued as of September 24, 2011.  

We also have contingent consideration obligations related to our Sentinelle Medical, Interlace, TCT and Healthcome acquisitions. Pursuant to ASC 805, contingent consideration pertaining to Sentinelle Medical and Interlace is required to be recorded as a liability at fair value and the adjustments to fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the Interlace acquisition, $2.1 million of the initial consideration was recorded as compensation expense and paid in fiscal 2011 based on continuing employment, and no further amounts of contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense related to this acquisition. Contingent consideration pertaining to TCT and Healthcome is contingent upon future employment and is being recorded as compensation expense as it is earned over the respective service periods. For additional information pertaining to the acquisitions, contingent consideration terms and the assumptions used to fair value contingent consideration, refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.

Table of Contents 

A summary of amounts recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2011 is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In connection with our acquisition of Sentinelle Medical, we have an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two-year period of up to a maximum of $250.0 million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. We made the first payment of $4.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, and at September 24, 2011, this liability is recorded at $10.9 million.  

In connection with our acquisition of Interlace, we have an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two-year period up to a maximum payout of $225.0 million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition. No amounts have been paid, and at September 24, 2011, this liability is recorded at $92.9 million.  

Under the sale and purchase agreement for TCT, $35.0 million of the purchase price is deferred for one year from the date of the acquisition, and any working capital adjustment, which is currently estimated to be $13.0 million (collectively, the Deferred Installment Payment) is due with the $35.0 million. In addition, we have an obligation to certain of the former shareholders, based on future employment, to make contingent payments over a two year period not to exceed $200.0 million less the Deferred Installment Payment. Each of the components of the purchase price, as well as thresholds, are subject to adjustment. At September 24, 2011, we have accrued $17.6 million for these contingent payments.  

In connection with our acquisition of Healthcome, we have an obligation to the former shareholders, who remain employed, to make contingent payments up to $7.1 million over three years. At September 24, 2011, we have accrued $0.3 million for these contingent payments.  

A summary of amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 24, 2011 is as follows:

Contractual Obligations  

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 24, 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Our Convertible Notes can first be put to us on December 13, 2013, and we have assumed for purpose of the above table that the remaining portion of the Original Notes will be paid off in fiscal 2014. On November 18, 2010, we exchanged Exchange Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million for Original Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million. The first put date on the Exchange Notes is December 15, 2016, and we have assumed for purposes of the above table that the Exchange Notes will be paid off in fiscal 2017.  

 (2) The financing leases represent two leases for an office building and a manufacturing facility, which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under US GAAP. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information.  

 (3) Amounts represent those recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Contingent Earn-Out Payments for a more complete description of our contingent earn-out obligations.  

 (4) Purchase obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, and to a lesser extent, other operating expense commitments.  

 (5) Pension obligations do not include our obligation under the DCP of $17.2 million, which is recorded as a current liability. The DCP benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.  

 (6) This represents a private equity investment commitment with a limited liability partnership.  

The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under FIN 48 (codified primarily in ASC 740, Income Taxes) totaling $11.2 million. Due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above.  

Future Liquidity Considerations  

We expect to continue to review and evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies, and strategic alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business. Subject to the Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and the general disclaimers set forth in our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report, we believe that cash flow from  

72  

Table of Contents 

 operations will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, contingent consideration obligations, acquisitions or other investments, or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities. The holders of the Original Notes in the principal amount of $1.275 billion may require us to repurchase the notes on December 13, 2013, and on each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, and the holders of the Exchange Notes in the principal amount of $450.0 million may require us to repurchase the notes on December 15, 2016, December 15, 2020, December 15, 2025, December 13, 2030 and December 14, 2035. These capital requirements could be substantial. Our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced Risk Factors as elsewhere in this report. These risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.  

Legal Contingencies  

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. In connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  

The following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

Inventory  

Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. As a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures on products and prices, reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions.  

73  

Table of Contents 

 We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product expiration or end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future. If inventory is determined to be overvalued, we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results. When recorded, our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value.  

Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. We record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of product revenue.  

Accounts Receivable Reserves  

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors, including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non-payment, and evaluation of the customers current financial situation. In the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us, we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customers current credit worthiness. We continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, for example as a result of the ongoing financial and economic uncertainty or otherwise, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  

We also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. If the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected.  

Business Combinations  

We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. As a result of our adoption of ASC 805 in fiscal 2010, contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, which are probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario. These cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate. Quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in-process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. As a result of our adoption of ASC 805, we capitalize these assets and record them in our consolidated balance sheet. Under ASC 805, in-process research and development assets are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill and once the project is complete, if at all, the asset is amortized over its remaining useful life. Prior to the adoption of ASC 805, we expensed the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result.  

We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects.  

We have also used the income approach, as described above, to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, customer relationships and trade names. Developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know-how. Customer relationships represent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. Trade names represent acquired company and product names. For business licenses, we use a combination of the lost profits method and replacement cost method to value such assets. Business licenses allow us to conduct business in a certain country, namely China.  

Intangible Assets and Goodwill  

Intangible Assets  

We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed. The economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 30 years. We review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write-down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. In assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. We generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, in connection with our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our MammoSite reporting unit, which is included in the Breast Health reportable segment, due to changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market, including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management, as well as competitive pricing pressures  

75

 and competition from existing and alternative new technologies. These factors resulted in us lowering the financial projections for MammoSite. As a result, we performed the first step in the long-lived assets impairment test pursuant to ASC 360 and compared MammoSites forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets. These undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover MammoSites carrying value. Therefore, we determined the fair value of MammoSites long-lived assets, which are primarily intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow technique. The expected future cash flows are Level 3 inputs under ASC 820 and are those expected to be generated by the market participants, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. Based on the fair value of the long-lived assets, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $143.5 million to write these intangible assets down to their fair value. The charge was comprised of $123.4 million related to developed technology, which was recorded in cost of product sales, $11.8 million related to customer relationships and $8.3 million related to trade names, which were recorded in impairment of intangible assets. In addition, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $76.7 million (see below for further discussion).  

Goodwill  

We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate or operational performance of the business, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.  

In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC 350. The first step requires a comparison of the reporting units carrying value to its fair value. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. The valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies. We base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of market participants. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value.  

We conducted our fiscal 2011 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We utilized discounted cash flow (DCF) and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 26, 2011, and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making its impairment test conclusions. We believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates. As a result of completing Step 1, all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required. For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each reporting unit been lower by 10%, each reporting unit would have still passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.  

We conducted our fiscal 2010 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We utilized DCF and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 27, 2010, and believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows and market multiples. As a result of completing Step 1, all of the Companys reporting units, except MammoSite, had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units. MammoSites fair value has declined from fiscal 2009 primarily due to a reduction in its long-term growth rates. The changes in MammoSites financial projections were a result of changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market, including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management, as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies. The DCF calculation of fair value was positively impacted by a reduction in the discount rate to 11.0% from 12.5% used in the fiscal 2009 annual impairment test.

We performed the Step 2 analysis for MammoSite, consistent with the procedures described above, and recorded a $76.7 million goodwill impairment charge. For illustrative purposes had the fair value of MammoSite been 10% lower, the charge would have been higher by $2.5 million. If the fair value of the Companys other reporting units had been lower by 10%, one reporting unit would have failed Step 1 requiring a Step 2 analysis. This reporting unit is in the Breast Health reportable segment and had a fair value at the annual impairment measurement date that exceeded its carrying value by 4% with goodwill of $256.5 million. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined by use of the DCF, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the WACC, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher WACC because market participants would require a higher rate of return. In the DCF as the WACC increases, the fair value decreases. The other significant factor in the DCF is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit. At September 25, 2010, for our other reporting units with goodwill aggregating $1.85 billion as of September 25, 2010, we believed that these reporting units were not at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.  

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, based upon a combination of factors, including the deteriorating macro-economic environment, declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets, we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of December 27, 2008. As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of December 27, 2008. Step 1 of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain reporting units, acquired in connection with the Cytyc acquisition, exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units. As a result, we were required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment charges for each of the applicable reporting units. The Step 2 analysis required us to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each of these reporting units to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill by reporting unit. Due to the complexities and time involved in preparing the Step 1 analysis, we had not commenced the Step 2 analysis as of February 5, 2009, the date we filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 27, 2008. As a result of the fact that we had not commenced the Step 2 analysis and the complexity of the analysis required to complete the Step 2 analysis, we were unable to determine that an impairment loss, in accordance with ASC 450, was both probable and reasonably estimable at December 27, 2008. We completed the Step 2 analysis during our second quarter of fiscal 2009, which resulted in an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of $2.34 billion. This impairment charge is comprised of $1.17 billion for GYN Surgical, $908.3 million for Diagnostics, and $265.9 million for Breast Health related to our MammoSite reporting unit acquired from Cytyc. We believe that our procedures and related assumptions for estimating the reporting units fair value are reasonable and consistent with the market conditions that existed at the time of the impairment test.  

For illustrative purposes, had the fair values of each reporting unit for which we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 been lower by 10% as of December 27, 2008, we would have recorded an additional impairment charge of $435.5 million. Based on our estimates as of December 27, 2008, the impact of reducing our fair value estimates for our other reporting units, for which we did not record any goodwill impairment charges, by 10% would have had no impact on the goodwill assessment for those reporting units.  

We conducted our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In order to complete the annual impairment test, we updated our interim impairment test results and performed detailed analyses estimating the fair value of most of our reporting units utilizing our fiscal 2010 forecast with updated long-term growth assumptions. For one reporting unit, we utilized the results of our interim impairment test. Pursuant to ASC 350-20-35-29, we concluded that it met the required criteria to use the estimated fair value determined from its interim impairment analysis for this reporting unit because 1) the composition of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit had not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination,  

77  

Table of Contents 

 2) the most recent fair value determination resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by a substantial margin, and 3) management concluded, based on an analysis of current events that had occurred and circumstances that had changed since the most recent fair value determination, that it is remote that the current fair value of the reporting unit would not exceed their carrying amounts.  

As a result of completing Step 1, all of our reporting units, except one, had a fair value exceeding their carrying value, and as such, Step 2 of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units. For the reporting unit that failed Step 1, we completed Step 2 and determined that an impairment charge was not required due to the fair value of the implied goodwill exceeding the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of this reporting unit at June 28, 2009 been lower by 10%, the Company still would not have recorded any impairment charge.  

The estimate of fair value requires significant judgment. Any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded.  

Conceptus Litigation. We have ongoing litigation with Conceptus regarding potential patent infringement of a Conceptus patent by our Adiana system. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Conceptus and awarded Conceptus $18.8 million in damages. Post trial motions will be filed addressing certain issues that could impact the ultimate outcome of this case. We also expect that Conceptus will seek to enjoin us from further sales of the Adiana system. A hearing on the post trial motions and injunctions request is scheduled for December 22, 2011. The jury verdict and any such determinations are subject to appeal by either party. If Conceptus is successful in upholding the verdict, we may be required to remove the Adiana system from the market. The jury verdict and subsequent litigation status may be an indicator of impairment for our GYN Surgical reporting unit. A reduction in the anticipated future cash flows of our GYN Surgical reporting unit could result in a material impairment charge that would have an adverse impact on our operating results. We will further evaluate this matter in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis and a long-lived asset impairment analysis, if required.  

Revenue Recognition  

We generate revenue from the sale of products, primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems.  

In September 2009, the FASB ratified ASC Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009-13). ASU 2009-13 amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards that are currently within the scope of ASC, Subtopic 605-25, which is the revenue recognition standard for multiple-element arrangements. ASU 2009-13 provides for three significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance as follows:  

   1) Removed the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement. This may result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting.  

   2) Modified the manner in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separately identified deliverables. ASU 2009-13 requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using its best estimate of selling prices (ESP) of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) or third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), if VSOE is not available. Each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price, which can be based on managements estimate when there is no other means (VSOE or TPE) to determine the selling price of that deliverable. The arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative selling prices.  

78  

Table of Contents 

   3) Eliminated use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method, which results in the discount in the transaction being evenly allocated to the separate units of accounting.  

In September 2009, the FASB ratified ASU No. 2009-14, Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements (ASU 2009-14). ASU 2009-14 amends the existing revenue recognition accounting standards to remove tangible products that contain software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance.  

As permitted, we elected to early adopt these new accounting standards at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2010 on a prospective basis for transactions originating or materially modified on or after September 27, 2009. These accounting standards generally do not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions, and most products and services qualify as separate units of accounting. The impact of adopting these new accounting standards was not material to our financial statements for the year ended September 25, 2010, and if they were applied in the same manner to fiscal 2009 would not have had a material impact to revenue recorded in fiscal 2009, or any of the interim periods therein.  

We recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance, the sales price is fixed or determinable, no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Generally, our product arrangements for capital equipment sales, primarily in our Breast Health and Skeletal Health reporting segments, are multiple-element arrangements, including services, such as installation and training, and multiple products. In accordance with ASC 605-25, based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements, we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as revenue as such services are performed. The relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered. There is no customer right of return in our sales agreements.  

Service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty, installation and training, and shipping and handling costs billed to customers. Service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed.  

We typically determine the selling price of our products and services based on VSOE and determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution, and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining VSOE. We typically have had VSOE for our products and services.  

If VSOE cannot be established, which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent, or product pricing is not within a narrow range, we attempt to establish the selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.  

When we cannot determine VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross margin objectives, method of distribution, information gathered from experience in customer negotiations, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies.

Some of our products have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-14, we had determined that except for our CAD products and Dimensions 2D/3D full field digital mammography products (Dimensions), the software element in our other products was incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules and were not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, ASC 985-605, SoftwareRevenue Recognition. We had determined that given the significance of the software components functionality to our CAD systems and Dimensions products, which are in the Breast Health segment, these products were within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules.  

ASC 985-605 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative VSOE of fair value. If VSOE does not exist for a delivered element, the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on VSOE with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements. For multiple-element software arrangements where VSOE of fair value of Post-Contract Customer Support (PCS) has been established, we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  

Upon the release of the Dimensions product in fiscal 2009, we completed an evaluation of the software component in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules. As a result, we had determined that the Dimensions product contained software that was more than incidental to the product as a whole and should be accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules.  

In connection with the adoption of ASU 2009-14, we re-evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our products and determined that the Dimensions products, which have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality (i.e., it is a tangible product), are scoped out of ASC 985-605, however, our CAD products will continue to be subject to ASC 985-605. Dimensions transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2010 will continue to be accounted for under ASC 985-605.  

Under customer usage agreements, we install certain equipment (for example, a ThinPrep Processor or a ThinPrep Imaging System) at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price (generally including a usage fee for the equipment) over a defined contract term, which is typically between three and five years. Revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as disposable products are delivered. We also rent certain equipment to customers and revenue from rental agreements is recorded over the term of the rental agreements.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

We recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units issued to our employees. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisors model. The model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:  

Expected volatilityWe are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility, which is weighted based on a number of factors.  

Expected termWe use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.  

80  

Table of Contents 

Risk-free interest rateThe yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.  

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. ASC 718, Stock Compensation, requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on an analysis of historical forfeitures, we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 5% as of September 24, 2011 depending on the specific employee group. This analysis is re-evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.  

We recognized $35.5 million, $34.2 million and $32.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of September 24, 2011, there was $30.8 million and $32.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years and 2.4 years, respectively.  

Income Taxes  

We use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.  

We have recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $917.8 million at September 24, 2011 and $882.8 million at September 25, 2010. The liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and the debt discount and original issuance discount on our Convertible Notes. The tax assets relate primarily net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.  

We had gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, of $30.6 million as of September 24, 2011 and $33.5 million as of September 25, 2010. At September 24, 2011, $30.6 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate. In the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $2.6 million due to expiration of statute of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities, all of which would reduce our effective tax rate.  

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Presentation of Comprehensive Income  

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which requires an entity to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 does not change any of the components of comprehensive income, but it eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2013 and should be applied retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2011-05 on our consolidated financial statements.  

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements  

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is effective for us in our second quarter of fiscal 2012 and should be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2011-04 on our consolidated financial statements.  

Business Combinations  

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805)Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. ASU 2010-29 requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior year. It also requires a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported revenue and earnings. The new disclosure will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of ASU 2010-29 will require additional disclosure in the event of a business combination but will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350). ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. ASU 2010-28 is effective for us in fiscal 2012. We do not believe that ASU 2010-28 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011-08 allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. ASU 2011-08 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2013, although early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that ASU 2011-08 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
