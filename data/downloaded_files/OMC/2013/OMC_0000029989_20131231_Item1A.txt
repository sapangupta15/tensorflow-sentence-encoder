Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our entry into the Business Combination Agreement with Publicis may have adverse impacts.

In order to complete the Business Combination with Publicis, customary closing conditions must be satisfied, including receipt of approvals by governmental regulators and authorities, including approvals under applicable competition laws, approval by our and Publicis shareholders of the Transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the listing of the Publicis Omnicom Group shares on the applicable stock exchanges, and the absence of a material adverse effect on either our business or the Publicis business. It is not certain that these conditions will be met or waived, that we and Publicis will be able to obtain the necessary approvals, or that we will be able to resolve all open issues, complexities and challenges necessary to consummate successfully the business combination as provided for under the Business Combination Agreement, or at all.

We face risks and uncertainties due both to the pendency of the business combination as well as the potential failure to consummate the business combination, including:

•we may not realize any or all of the potential benefits combining the businesses of Omnicom and Publicis;

•even if the business combination is not consummated, we will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting, and other costs relating to the business combination;

• we may have to pay a termination fee of $500 million in cash to Publicis under some circumstances if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated before we complete the business combination;

•the pending business combination could have an adverse impact on our relationships with employees, clients and suppliers, and prospective clients or other third parties may delay or decline entering into agreements with us as a result of the announcement of the proposed business combination; and

•the attention of our management and employees may be diverted from our day-to-day operations.

The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business and cash flows, results of operations and financial position.

Global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position.

Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. In particular, current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services. If domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. There can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective.

A reduction in client spending, a delay in client payments or conditions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

Global economic uncertainty, turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses, including us, to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us, and could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. We could need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements in such circumstances. There is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable.

In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services.

Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

In addition, methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn. 

Companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

The markets we operate in are highly competitive and are expected to remain so. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. While many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. We have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

The success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, the retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce.

Our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

Our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, including highly skilled technically proficient personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Approximately 51% of our revenue in 2013 came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. It is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. A significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We rely extensively on information technology systems.

We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. While we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business.

Government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. Any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. Such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Additionally, government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. These actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position and liquidity.

We face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. The operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. We also must comply with applicable U.S. local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For financial information on our operations by geographic region, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

We are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries and high-growth markets.

We conduct business in numerous developing countries and high-growth markets around the world. Our operations outside the United States are also exposed to risks that include: slower receipt of payments; social, political and economic instability, currency fluctuation and currency repatriation restrictions. In addition, commercial laws in developing countries and high-growth markets can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced or frequently changed. If we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in countries and markets where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries and markets could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us.

Standard and Poor’s Rating Service, or S&P, rates our long-term debt BBB+ and Moody’s Investors Service, or Moody's, rates our long-term debt Baa1. Our short-term debt ratings are A2 and P2 by the respective rating agencies. Our outstanding Senior Notes, Convertible Notes due July 31, 2032, or the 2032 Notes, and $2.5 billion Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. However, the interest rates and fees on our Credit Agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. Also, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. Our 2032 Notes would become convertible into shares of our common stock if the credit ratings assigned to the 2032 Notes are downgraded to BBB or lower by S&P or Baa3 or lower by Moody’s.

We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions.

We regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

Our goodwill may become impaired, which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions.

Generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise; although, our businesses could be in the future. However, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. Further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. At this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position.
