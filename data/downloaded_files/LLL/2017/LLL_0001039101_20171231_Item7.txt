Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Overview and Outlook  

L3s Business  

L3 is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications and fleet management of special mission aircraft), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment, and security and detection systems. L3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of communication, electronic and sensor systems used on military, homeland security and commercial platforms. Our customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), foreign governments, and domestic and foreign commercial customers.  

We have the following four reportable segments: (1) Electronic Systems, (2) Aerospace Systems, (3) Communication Systems and (4) Sensor Systems. Financial information for our segments is included in Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 

Electronic Systems provide a broad range of products and services, including components, products, subsystems, systems and related services to military and commercial customers. These products and services serve niche markets such as, aircraft simulation and training, power and distribution, cockpit avionics, airport security and precision weapons. The Electronic Systems business areas are Total Training Solutions, Power & Propulsion Systems, Aviation Products, Precision Engagement Systems and Security & Detection Systems. 

Aerospace Systems provide products and services for the global ISR and Command, Control and Communications (C3) markets, specializing in signals intelligence (SIGINT) and multi-intelligence platforms, including engineering, modernization and sustainment solutions for military and various government aircraft, ground support equipment and other platforms. These strategic and tactical products and services provide warfighters with the ability to detect, collect, identify, analyze and disseminate information from command centers, communication nodes and air defense systems for real-time situational awareness and response. Aerospace Systems sells these products and services primarily to the DoD and select foreign governments. The Aerospace Systems business areas are Mission Integration, MAS, Aerostructures and Advanced Systems. 

Communication Systems provide network and communication systems, secure communications products, radio frequency (RF) components, satellite communication terminals and space, microwave and telemetry products. These products include secure data links that are used to connect a variety of space, airborne, ground and sea-based communication systems and are used in transmission, processing, recording, monitoring and dissemination functions of these communication systems. Communication Systems sells these products and services primarily to the DoD and select foreign governments. The Communications Systems business areas are Broadband Communication Systems, Space & Power Systems and Advanced Communications.

The Sensor Systems business areas are Space & Sensor Systems, Airborne Sensor Systems, Warrior Sensor Systems, Maritime Sensor Systems, Intelligence & Mission Systems and Advanced Programs.  

On October 16, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a plan to explore strategic alternatives to sell or otherwise divest the Vertex Aerospace business. We expect to complete a sale in 2018. The divestiture of the Vertex Aerospace business represents a strategic shift by us to exit the logistics solution and maintenance services business for military aircraft where we do not provide complex ISR systems integration and modification. The Vertex Aerospace business generated sales of $1.4 billion in 2017, $1.3 billion in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2015. The assets and liabilities and results of operations of the Vertex Aerospace business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

On December 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our National Security Solutions (NSS) segment to CACI International Inc. The transaction was completed on February 1, 2016. NSS provided cybersecurity solutions, high-performance computing, enterprise IT services, analytics and intelligence analysis to the DoD, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, federal civilian agencies and foreign governments. The results of operations of NSS are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

All references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to L3s continuing operations, unless specifically noted.  

We generated sales of $9,573 million and $9,210 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and our primary customer was the DoD. See Part I — Item 1 — Business — Major Customers for additional information regarding a summary of our sales by end customer and the percent contributed by each to our total sales. 

Most of our contracts (revenue arrangements) with the U.S. Government are subject to U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency audits and various cost and pricing regulations and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. Multiyear U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable. Foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government.  

Business Environment 

U.S. Government Markets. Sales to U.S. Government customers represented 70% of our 2017 sales and were primarily to DoD customers, which comprised 66% of our sales. Therefore, our annual sales are generally highly correlated to changes in U.S. Government spending levels, especially DoD budget levels.  

The total DoD budget for FY 2016 was $581 billion, an increase of 4% compared to FY 2015. The increase was due to a higher base budget of $522 billion, representing an increase of $25 billion compared to FY 2015. The FY 2016 OCO budget declined slightly to $59 billion compared to $63 billion for FY 2015. 

On May 4, 2017, Congress passed the FY 2017 Appropriations Bill, which provides for a $606 billion total FY 2017 DoD Budget ($523 billion base budget, $83 billion OCO), an increase of 4% compared to the appropriated FY 2016 DoD budget. President Trump signed the FY 2017 Appropriations Bill into law on May 5, 2017. 

On May 23, 2017, the Trump Administration submitted its FY 2018 DoD budget request (Budget Request) to Congress. The Budget Request included a $574 billion base budget and a $65 billion OCO budget for a total FY 2018 DoD budget of $639 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the total FY 2017 DoD Budget. On July 14, 2017, the House of Representatives and, separately on September 18, 2017, the Senate each passed their own versions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Both the House and Senate versions of the FY 2018 NDAA included authorization spending levels higher than the Budget Request, and such authorized spending would represent an increase of at least 10% compared to the total FY 2017 DoD Budget. The FY 2018 Budget Request and both the  

24  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

House and Senate versions of the FY 2018 NDAA exceed the statutory budget cap for defense spending as specified by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which mandates a DoD base budget of approximately $522 billion for FY 2018. Accordingly, in order to appropriate funds as submitted by the Budget Request or House and Senate versions of the FY 2018 NDAA, Congress must provide relief from the BCA spending caps through law enacted by Congress. The House and Senate versions of the FY 2018 NDAA were reconciled via the conference process and signed into law by the President on December 12, 2017. The enacted FY 2018 NDAA authorizes a total of $699.9 billion for all Defense spending, including a $634.2 billion base budget and an additional $65.7 billion for OCO.  

Because the FY 2018 DoD Appropriations bill was not enacted into law prior to start of fiscal year 2018 (October 1, 2017), DoDs FY 2018 funding was addressed through a series of Continuing Resolutions (CR), the latest of which is due to expire on March 23, 2018. However, on February 9, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), a bipartisan two-year budget and debt ceiling agreement that provides a level of stability in the U.S. Government budget process over the next two fiscal years (FYs 2018 and 2019). The BBA included a short-term CR extension to March 23, 2018, to allow for completion of the FY 2018 appropriations process (including enactment of the FY 2018 DoD Appropriations bill). While 2018 BBA does raise the spending caps for FY 2018 and FY 2019 previously constrained by the BCA and temporarily suspends the statutory debt ceiling through March 1, 2019, it does not modify the BCAs spending caps or sequestration mechanism beyond FY 2019.  

On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY 2019 DoD budget request to Congress. The table below presents the FY 2011 through FY 2017 DoD enacted budgets and the FY 2018 Budget Request for DoD and the FY 2019 DoD Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), as proposed within the FY 2019 DoD Budget Request. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Source: United States Department of Defense FY 2019 Budget Request. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

While the BBA provides a level of stability, future DoD budgets and spending levels are determined by a number of factors beyond our control, including changes to U.S. procurement policies, current and future domestic and international budget conditions, presidential administration priorities and changing national security and defense requirements. Furthermore, the U.S. Governments overall fiscal challenges remain, including uncertainties regarding BCA sequestration cuts after FY 2019 and, therefore, future DoD budgets and spending levels are difficult to predict. Although, uncertainty exists, we believe that L3 will benefit from several of the DoDs focus areas such as ISR, unmanned systems, undersea warfare, precision strike, secure communications, missile defense and space programs, electronic warfare, aircraft readiness and the ability to project power in denied environments. For more information on the risks and uncertainties related to our U.S. Government contracts, see Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

International and Commercial Markets. Sales to end customers other than the U.S. Government represented 30% of our 2017 sales. We expect sales to international and commercial customers to continue to represent approximately 30% of our consolidated 2018 sales. These sales are generally affected by global economic conditions,  

25  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

geopolitical and security conditions and commodity prices, as well as our competitive success in winning new business and increasing our market share. We believe that L3 will benefit from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and under Foreign Military Sales agreements between the U.S. Government and foreign governments. Although our international sales are experiencing near-term softness, we believe the focus of our international markets in areas such as ISR, simulators, communication systems, night vision products and sensors systems will benefit L3 in the long-term. We also believe that the commercial markets in which we participate such as aviation products, security and screening, simulation and training, and radio frequency microwave and power have long-term favorable fundamentals.  

Key Performance Measures  

The primary financial performance measures that we use to manage our businesses and monitor results of operations are (i) sales, (ii) operating income and (iii) net cash from operating activities (Operating Cash Flow). Management believes that these financial performance measures are the primary growth drivers for our earnings per share and cash flow per common share. Generally, in evaluating our businesses and contract performance, we focus on net sales, operating income, operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of sales, and the financial performance measure of Operating Cash Flow, and not the type or amount of operating costs.  

One of our primary business objectives is to increase sales organically and through select business acquisitions. We define organic sales as net sales excluding the sales impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Sales declines related to business divestitures are sales from divestitures that are included in our actual results for a twelve-month period prior to the divestitures. Sales increases related to acquired businesses are sales from acquisitions that are included in our actual results for less than a twelve-month period. We expect to supplement, strengthen and enhance our existing businesses by selectively acquiring businesses that: (1) add important new technologies and products, (2) provide access to select customers, programs and contracts and (3) provide attractive returns on investment. Another important financial performance measure that we use is operating margin, because sales growth combined with operating margin levels determine our operating income levels. Operating Cash Flow is also an important financial performance measure because Operating Cash Flow measures our ability to convert operating income into cash after paying income taxes and interest expenses and investing in working capital.  

Sales Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated net sales of $9,573 million increased by 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales increased $213 million, or 2%, and net sales from business acquisitions was $204 million, or 2%. These increases were partially offset by divestitures of $54 million, or 1%. Our average annual sales declined for the five years ended December 31, 2017 by 2% primarily due to a decline in average annual organic sales of approximately 1%. See Results of Operations, including segment results below for a further discussion of sales.  

We derived approximately 66% of our 2017 sales from DoD customers; as a result, our sales are highly correlated to DoD budget levels. DoD budgets are a function of several factors and uncertainties beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, U.S. military engagements, changing national security and defense requirements, geo-political developments, actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for defense budgets, and sequestration and other DoD budget reductions. Any of these factors could result in a significant increase, decrease or redirection of DoD budgets and impact L3s future results of operations, including our sales and operating income growth rates. Additionally, L3s future results of operations will be affected by our ability to retain our existing business, including our revenue arrangements with DoD customers, and to successfully re-compete for existing business and compete for new business, which largely depends on: (1) our successful performance on existing contracts, (2) the effectiveness and innovation of our technologies and research and development activities, (3) our ability to offer better program performance than our competitors at an affordable cost and (4) our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones, particularly those employees who have U.S. Government security clearances and those with clearances of top-secret and above. We expect our 2018 consolidated sales to increase by approximately 4% compared to 2017, including an organic sales increase of 3%. We expect organic sales to the DoD and U.S. Government to increase by approximately 4% and organic international sales to decline by approximately 4% due to the completion of certain contracts with foreign governments. We expect organic commercial sales to increase by approximately 9%, primarily for commercial aviation products.  

Operating Income and Margin Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our operating income was $1,020 million, an increase of 7% from $957 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our operating margin  

26  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

was 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 30 basis points from 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Results of Operations, including segment results below, for a further discussion of operating margin.  

Our effective management of labor, material, subcontractor and other direct costs is an important element of cost control and favorable contract performance. We believe that proactively re-sizing our businesses to their anticipated sales, combined with continuous cost improvement, will enable us to increase our cost competitiveness. While we continue to undertake cost management actions, such as reducing our indirect costs, curtailing pension benefits for salaried employees, resizing select business units and improving our productivity and contract performance in an effort to maintain or even increase operating margin, these efforts may not be successful and may be partially or fully offset by other cost increases. Furthermore, as a U.S. Government contractor, we do not retain the benefit of all cost management actions, particularly on cost-plus type contracts or on contracts where we are the sole-source provider. Although we expect our 2018 annual consolidated and segment operating margin to increase as compared to 2017, changes in the competitive environment and DoD procurement practices and changes in annual pension expense, including related assumptions such as the benefit obligation discount rates, among other factors, could result in lower operating margin. Furthermore, select business acquisitions and new business, including contract renewals and new contracts, could have lower future operating margins compared to our operating margins on existing contracts and could reduce future operating margins.  

Operating Cash Flow Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Operating Cash Flow was $985 million, a decrease of 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Operating Cash Flow was primarily driven by higher income tax payments.  

U.S. Tax Reform 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), which made significant changes to the U.S. tax system. Significant changes under U.S. Tax Reform include, among other things, the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the implementation of a modified territorial tax system, and the imposition of a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S. owned foreign subsidiaries (Toll Charge). 

We recognized the income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implication of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB 118), in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. SAB 118 provides guidance for the application of income tax accounting standards related to U.S. Tax Reform. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements reflect the income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined. We recorded an estimated tax benefit of $79 million from U.S. Tax Reform, which includes a $101 million estimated tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes partially offset by an estimated tax provision of $22 million related to the Toll Charge. The preliminary net tax benefit recorded may differ in the future due principally to changes to the interpretations of U.S. Tax Reform, legislative action to clarify the interpretation of U.S. Tax Reform and changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the tax benefit. We expect to finalize the tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform with the filing of our tax return and record the difference between the final benefit and the provisional benefit recorded in the 2018 fourth quarter, if any, at that time. 

Discontinued Operations  

Vertex Aerospace. On October 16, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a plan to explore strategic alternatives to sell or otherwise divest the Vertex Aerospace business. We expect to complete a sale in 2018. The divestiture of the Vertex Aerospace business represents a strategic shift by us to exit the logistics solution and maintenance services business for military aircraft where we do not provide complex ISR systems integration and modification. The Vertex Aerospace business generated sales of $1.4 billion in 2017, $1.3 billion in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2015. The assets and liabilities and results of operations of the Vertex Aerospace business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

National Security Solutions (NSS). On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our NSS segment to CACI International Inc. for a sales price of $547 million.  

See Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table below presents the statements of operations data for Vertex Aerospace and NSS. The amounts presented in discontinued operations include allocated interest expenses for debt not directly attributable or related to L3s other operations. Interest expense was allocated in accordance with the accounting standards for discontinued operations and were based on the ratio of their net assets to the sum of: (1) total L3 consolidated net assets and (2) L3 consolidated total debt. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $1 million of trailing expenses related to the sale of NSS. The year ended December 31, 2016 included a gain of $64 million (before and after income taxes) on the sale of NSS.   

  (2) Due to a decline in estimated fair value, we recorded goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015. The impairment charge of $187 million recorded during 2017 relates to Vertex Aerospace. The impairment charge of $909 million recorded during 2015 consists of: (i) $571 million related to NSS and (ii) $338 million related to Vertex Aerospace.   

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures  

As discussed above, one aspect of our strategy is to selectively acquire businesses that add new products and technologies or provide access to select customers, programs and contracts. We intend to continue acquiring select businesses for reasonable valuations that will provide attractive returns to L3. Our business acquisitions, depending on their contract-type, sales mix or other factors, could reduce L3s consolidated operating margin while still increasing L3s operating income, earnings per share and net cash from operating activities. In addition, we may also dispose of certain businesses if we determine that they no longer fit into L3s overall business strategy and we are able to receive an attractive price. 

Acquisitions. We regularly evaluate potential business acquisitions. The table below summarizes the acquisitions that we have completed during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 referred to herein as business acquisitions. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used net cash of $316 million for business acquisitions. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All of our business acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from their dates of acquisition. 

Divestitures. We regularly evaluate potential business divestitures. Below summarizes the divestitures that we have completed during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business divestitures.  

2017 Divestitures 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sales of the CTC Aviation Jet Services Limited (Aviation Jet Services) business, the L3 Coleman Aerospace (Coleman) business and the Display Product Line. The table below presents pre-tax (loss) gain recognized, the proceeds received and net sales included in continuing operations from these divestitures. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Aviation Jet Services Divestiture. On March 1, 2017, we divested our Aviation Jet Services business for a sales price of £1 million (approximately $1 million). Aviation Jet Services provided non-core aircraft management and operational services as part of commercial training solutions based in the United Kingdom and was included in the Electronic Systems segment.  

Coleman Divestiture. On February 24, 2017, we divested our Coleman business for a sales price of $15 million. Coleman provided air-launch ballistic missile targets and was included in the Electronic Systems segment.  

Display Product Line Divestiture. On February 23, 2017, we divested our Display Product Line for a sales price of $7 million. The Display Product Line provided cockpits to various military aircraft and was included in the Electronic Systems segment.

Klein Divestiture. On December 31, 2015, we divested our Klein business for a sales price of $10 million. Klein provided side scan sonar equipment and waterside security and surveillance systems and was included in the Sensor Systems segment. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and cost of sales during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions for L3 relate to contract revenue, profit and loss recognition, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, pension and post-retirement benefit obligations, income taxes, including the valuations of deferred tax assets, litigation reserves, useful lives and valuation of recorded amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Changes in estimates are reflected in the periods during which they become known. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and could differ materially. We believe that our critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and require judgment at the time of the estimate, (2) use of reasonably different assumptions could have changed our estimates, particularly with respect to estimates of contract revenues and costs, and recoverability of assets, and (3) changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Contract Revenue Recognition and Contract Estimates. Approximately 59% of our consolidated net sales are generated from contracts (revenue arrangements) that require us to design, develop, manufacture, modify, upgrade, test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment and to provide related engineering and technical services according to the buyers specifications. These revenue arrangements or contracts are generally fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material type and are covered by contract accounting standards. Substantially all of our cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts are with the U.S. Government, primarily the DoD. Certain of our contracts with the U.S. Government are multi-year contracts that are funded annually by the customer, and sales on these multi-year contracts are based on amounts appropriated (funded) by the U.S. Government. Our remaining sales are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers.  

Sales and profits on fixed-price type contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards are substantially recognized using percentage-of-completion (POC) methods of accounting. Sales on such contracts represent approximately 49% of our consolidated net sales. Sales and profits on fixed-price production contracts under which units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their contractual selling prices (the units-of-delivery method). Sales and profits on each fixed-price production contract under which units are not produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process, or under which a relatively few number of units are produced, are recorded based on the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative sales recognized in prior periods (the cost-to-cost method). Under both POC methods of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance, which can exceed one year.  

Accounting for the sales and profits on these fixed-price contracts requires the preparation of estimates of the: (1) total contract revenue, (2) total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work and (3) measurement of progress towards completion. The estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion. Under the units-of-delivery method, sales on a fixed-price type contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period based on their contractual selling prices. Under the cost-to-cost method, sales on a fixed-price type contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by (i) the total estimated contract revenue, less (ii) the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units-of-delivery method or cost-to-cost method is equal to (i) the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized, less (ii) the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract. In the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenues, a loss arises, and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that the loss becomes evident. The unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded as a component of other current liabilities entitled Estimated cost in excess of estimated contract value to complete contracts in process in a loss position.  

Revisions or adjustments to estimates for a contracts revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. Revisions or adjustments may also be required if contract modifications occur. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured. The impact of revisions in profit (loss) estimates for all types of contracts subject to POC accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. Revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as reduce the valuations of receivables and inventories, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Aggregate net changes in contract estimates amounted to increases of $184 million, or 18%, of consolidated operating income ($1.48 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2017, increases of $149 million, or 16%, of consolidated operating income ($1.23 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016, and increases of $52 million, or 7%, of consolidated operating income ($0.45 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Sales and profits on cost-plus type contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. Sales on such contracts represent approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales. The estimated  

31  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

profit on a cost-plus contract is fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement types. Incentive and award fees are our primary variable fee contractual arrangement types. Incentive and award fees on cost-plus type contracts are included as an element of total estimated contract revenues and recorded as sales when a basis exists for the reasonable prediction of performance in relation to established contractual targets and we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates for them. Sales and profits on time-and-material type contracts are recognized on the basis of direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour, plus the actual costs of material and other direct non-labor costs. On a time-and-material type contract, the fixed hourly rates include amounts for the cost of direct labor, indirect contract costs and profit. Cost-plus type or time-and-material type contracts generally contain less estimation risks than fixed-price type contracts.  

Sales on arrangements for (1) fixed-price type contracts that require us to perform services that are not related to the production of tangible assets (Fixed-Price Service Contracts) and (2) certain commercial customers are recognized in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers. Sales for our businesses whose customers are primarily commercial business enterprises are substantially all generated from single element revenue arrangements. Sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been performed, the selling price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales for Fixed-Price Service Contracts that do not contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual service period, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned, or obligations fulfilled, in a different manner. Sales for Fixed-Price Service Contracts that contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized when the units of work are completed. Sales and profit on cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts within the scope of accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers are recognized in the same manner as those within the scope of contract accounting standards, except for incentive and award fees. Cost-based incentive fees are recognized when they are realizable in the amount that would be due under the contractual termination provisions as if the contract was terminated. Performance based incentive fees and award fees are recorded as sales when objective evidence exists that the fees have been earned.  

For contracts with multiple deliverables, we apply the separation and allocation guidance under the accounting standard for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, unless all the deliverables are covered by contract accounting standards, in which case we apply the separation and allocation guidance under contract accounting standards. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables should be separated into more than one unit of accounting. We recognize revenue for each unit of accounting based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above.  

Sales and cost of sales in connection with contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government that contain collection risk, because the contracts are incrementally funded and subject to the availability of funds appropriated, are deferred until the contract modification is obtained, indicating that adequate funds are available to the contract or task order.  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, As Amended (commonly referred to as ASC 606), which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers and significantly expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of our efforts to evaluate and implement the new standard along with our evaluation of the expected impact of the standard on our audited consolidated financial statements. 

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. In accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation). Identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. However, we do not recognize separate intangible assets for the assembled workforces of our business acquisitions.  

Generally, the largest separately identifiable intangible asset from the businesses that we acquire is the value of their assembled workforces, which includes the human capital of the management, administrative, marketing and business development, scientific, engineering and technical employees of the acquired businesses. The success of our  

32  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

businesses, including their ability to retain existing business (revenue arrangements) and to successfully compete for and win new business (revenue arrangements), is primarily dependent on the management, marketing and business development, contracting, engineering and technical skills and knowledge of our employees, rather than on productive capital (plant and equipment, and technology and intellectual property). Additionally, for a significant portion of our businesses, our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with top-secret and above clearances, is critical to our success and is often a prerequisite for retaining existing revenue arrangements and pursuing new ones. Generally, patents, trademarks and licenses are not material for our acquired businesses. Furthermore, our U.S. Government contracts (revenue arrangements) generally permit other companies to use our patents in most domestic work performed by such other companies for the U.S. Government. Therefore, because intangible assets for assembled workforces are part of goodwill, the substantial majority of the intangible assets for our acquired business acquisitions are recognized as goodwill. Additionally, the value assigned to goodwill for our business acquisitions also includes the value that we expect to realize from growth expectations and cost reduction measures that we implement for our acquired businesses. Goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the fair value of identifiable acquired assets, both tangible and intangible, less the fair value of liabilities assumed. At December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $6,615 million and identifiable intangible assets of $292 million.  

The most significant identifiable intangible asset that is separately recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP for our business acquisitions is customer contractual relationships. All of our customer relationships are established through written customer contracts (revenue arrangements). The fair value for customer contractual relationships is determined, as of the date of acquisition, based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after-tax earnings and cash flows (including cash flows from working capital) arising from the follow-on sales on contract (revenue arrangement) renewals expected from customer contractual relationships over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales, less a contributory asset charge, all of which is discounted to present value. All identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives as the economic benefits are consumed. We review customer contractual relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with the accounting standards for long-lived assets. If any such event or change in circumstances occurs, and, if our revised estimates of future after-tax cash flows are significantly lower than our estimates at the date we acquired the customer contractual relationships, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write-down these intangible assets to their realizable values. We also review and update our estimates of the duration of our customer contractual relationships, at least annually. If such estimates indicate that the duration of our customer contractual relationships has decreased compared to the estimates made as of the date we acquired these intangible assets, then we accelerate the amortization period for our customer contractual relationships over their remaining useful lives.  

We review goodwill for impairment annually as of November 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The accounting standards for goodwill allow for the assessment of qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and entity relevant events or circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We did not utilize a qualitative assessment approach for the November 30, 2017 goodwill impairment test, as we chose instead to complete the quantitative testing process for each reporting unit.  

A reporting unit is an operating segment, as defined by the segment reporting accounting standards, or a component of an operating segment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by operating segment management. Two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes if the components have similar economic characteristics.  

L3 had 13 reporting units at December 31, 2017 and at November 30, 2017 when our annual goodwill impairment assessment was completed. L3 had 9 reporting units at December 31, 2016. The change in reporting units was a result of the segment realignment; effective March 1, 2017, we realigned our Electronic Systems segment, which was separated into two segments named (1) Electronic Systems and (2) Sensor Systems. Our annual impairment tests at November 30, 2017 and 2016 did not result in impairments to goodwill. In addition, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets of those reporting units by more than 20% at November 30, 2017. 

33  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

L3s aggregate balance of goodwill from continuing operations increased by $241 million to $6,615 million at December 31, 2017 from $6,374 million at December 31, 2016 due to increases of $200 million for business acquisitions, net of divestitures and $93 million for foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by $52 million reclassified to assets held for sale. The table below presents the number of reporting units and the associated goodwill at December 31, 2017 for each of our reportable segments.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

To test goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. To the extent the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized. Our methodology for determining the fair value of a reporting unit uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation approach, and is dependent on estimates for future sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income tax payments, working capital changes and capital expenditures, as well as expected long-term growth rates for cash flows. All of these factors are affected by economic conditions related to the industries in which we operate (predominantly the U.S. defense industry), as well as conditions in the U.S. capital markets.  

We performed an interim impairment test during the quarterly period ended September 29, 2017 for the Vertex Aerospace reporting unit and as a result of a decline in the estimated fair value, we recorded an impairment charge of $187 million ($133 million after income taxes) in 2017. The impairment charge is included in the Vertex Aerospace results of operations which are classified as discontinued operations. We performed an interim impairment test in 2015 for the NSS and the Vertex Aerospace reporting units and due to a decline in the estimated fair values we recorded aggregate goodwill impairment charges of $955 million ($46 million classified in continuing operations, for the retained businesses, and $909 million classified in discontinued operations).  

The more significant assumptions used in our DCF valuations to determine the fair values of our reporting units in connection with the goodwill valuation assessment at November 30, 2017 were: (1) detailed three-year cash flow projections for each of our reporting units, (2) the expected long-term cash flow growth rates for each of our reporting units (commonly known as Terminal Growth Rates), which approximate the expected long-term nominal growth rate for the U.S. DoD budget, the U.S. economy and the respective industries in which the reporting units operate, expected inflation rates, and specific circumstances for each reporting unit, including contracts or programs ending and expected new business and (3) risk adjusted discount rates, which represent the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each reporting unit and include the estimated risk-free rate of return that is used to discount future cash flow projections to their present values. There were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2017 as compared to the prior year DCF valuations of our reporting units.  

The WACC for each reporting unit was comprised of: (1) an estimated required rate of return on equity, based on publicly traded companies with business and economic risk characteristics comparable to each of L3s reporting units (Market Participants), including a risk free rate of return of 2.65% on the 20-year U.S. Treasury Bond at November 30, 2017 (2.73% as of November 30, 2016) and an equity risk premium of 6% (unchanged compared to November 30, 2016), and (2) an after-tax rate of return on Market Participants debt, which was derived from a selected corporate bond index having a Baa debt rating, consistent with the credit rating of the Market Participants. Each of the estimated required rate of return on equity and the after-tax rate of return on Market Participants debt is weighted by the relative market value percentages of the Market Participants equity and debt. The WACC assumptions for each reporting unit are based on a number of market inputs that are outside of our control and are updated annually to reflect changes to such market inputs as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessments, including changes to: (1) the estimated required rate of return on equity based on historical returns on common stock of Market Participants and the Standard & Poors 500 Index over the prior five-year period, (2) the risk free rate of return based on the prevailing market yield on the 20 year U.S. Treasury Bond, (3) the rate of return on corporate bonds having a debt rating consistent with the credit rating of the Market Participants and (4) the relative market value percentages of Market Participants equity and debt.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table below presents the weighted average risk adjusted discount rate assumptions in the WACC used in our DCF valuation for each of our reportable segments for our goodwill impairment assessments at November 30, 2017 and 2016.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) The weighted average risk adjusted discount rate in WACC for the Electronic Systems reportable segment is comprised of separate discount rates for each reporting unit within the segment that range from 7.05% to 7.78% for 2017 and 6.98% to 8.06% for 2016.   

  (2) The weighted average risk adjusted discount rate in WACC for the Sensor Systems reportable segment is comprised of separate discount rates for each reporting unit within the segment that range from 7.05% to 8.31% for 2017 and 6.98% to 8.01% for 2016.   

As presented in the table below, L3s historical three-year average annual cash flow growth rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 for our reportable segments ranged from a negative 9% to a positive 8%. The annual cash flows generated by each of our reporting units vary from year to year, and, therefore, the annual cash flow growth rates do not result in linear trends due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) variability of annual sales volume and sales growth rates, (2) increases and decreases in working capital, including customer advance payments and billings on multi-year contracts (revenue arrangements) with long-term performance periods (exceeding one year), (3) the timing of invoicing and cash collections between fiscal years from receivables due from customers on multi-year contracts (revenue arrangements), (4) the timing of increases and decreases of select inventories procured and produced in anticipation of future product sales, which frequently overlap the ending and beginning of fiscal years, (5) the timing of the receipt of award fee and incentive fee payments from customers on contracts (revenue arrangements), (6) variability in annual cash outlays for research and development costs, (7) changes in cash outlays for capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and (8) increases in annual sales and costs and expense volumes of a reporting unit resulting from business acquisitions. As a result of the factors discussed above and the varying sizes of our reporting units, the annual cash flow levels and growth rates at the reporting unit level tend to fluctuate significantly from year to year.  

The 2017 cash flow amount and the cash flow growth rate for each of the last three years for each of our segments are presented in the following table.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) Reportable segment estimated cash flow excludes interest payments on debt and other corporate cash flows.   

  (2) The increase in 2017 cash flows for Electronic Systems was primarily due to higher cash flows from operations and lower working capital requirements at Power & Propulsion Systems in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2016 cash flows was primarily due to lower working capital requirements and lower capital expenditures primarily at Power & Propulsion Systems. The increase in 2015 cash flows was primarily due to increases in working capital requirements at Aviation Products during 2014 that did not recur in 2015.   

  (3) The increase in 2017 cash flows for Aerospace Systems was primarily due to lower working capital requirements at Mission Integration. The increase in 2016 cash flows was primarily due to higher cash flows from operations compared to 2015 and lower working capital requirements at Mission Integration in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2015 cash flows was due to lower cash flows from operations compared to 2014 at Mission Integration due to cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts and higher working capital requirements at Mission Integration.   

  (4) The increase in 2017 cash flows for Communication Systems was due to improved cash flows from operations and lower working capital requirements at Broadband Communication Systems. The decrease in 2016 cash flows was primarily due to higher working capital requirements in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2015 cash flows was due to an increase in capital expenditures.   

  (5) The decrease in 2017 cash flows for Sensor Systems was primarily due to higher working capital requirements primarily at Maritime Sensor

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Systems. The increase in 2016 cash flows was primarily due to lower working capital requirements in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in 2015 cash flows was primarily related to Warrior Sensor Systems which was negatively impacted by costs related to alleged performance issues with EoTechs holographic weapons sight products and working capital reductions for night vision products in 2014 that did not recur in 2015. 

We consider several factors to determine expected future annual cash flows for our reporting units, including historical multi-year average cash flow trends by reporting unit and the expected future cash flow growth rates for each of our reporting units primarily based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and working capital changes. Furthermore, the substantial majority of our reporting units are primarily dependent upon the DoD budget and spending. Sales from DoD customers generate a significant portion of our annual sales and have historically represented approximately 66% or more of our total sales. Accordingly, to determine expected future annual cash flows for our reporting units we also consider: (1) the DoD budget and spending priorities, (2) expansion into new markets, (3) changing conditions in existing markets for our products, systems and services, (4) possible termination of certain government contracts, (5) expected success in new business competitions and re-competitions on existing business and (6) anticipated operating margins and working capital requirements, which vary significantly depending on the stage of completion (early, mature, ending) of contracts (revenue arrangements). We closely monitor changes in these factors and their impact on the expected cash flow of our reporting units. In addition to these factors that were relevant and specific to each of our reporting units, our goodwill impairment assessments at November 30, 2017 assumed 3.0% nominal growth in the base budget beginning with FY 2019, which is slightly less than the base budget cumulative average growth rate during the five year period from FY 2018 to FY 2023, as shown in the DoD budget table presented with our discussion of the business environment on page 25.  

Additionally, our actual cash flows may be higher than our projections, and the DCF valuation does not reflect actions that we may take to increase the profitability and cash flows of our reporting units. Actions we may take include consolidating and streamlining select business operations, creating future synergies with other L3 businesses or pursuing incremental targeted growth opportunities. Additionally, the DCF valuations do not assume future business acquisitions or divestitures.  

The table below presents the estimated: (1) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of cash flow for 2018 – 2022 and (2) terminal cash flow growth rates after 2022 for each of our reportable segments. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) Aerospace Systems projected cash flow is expected to decrease from $241 million in 2017 to $208 million in 2022. We expect a decrease primarily due to higher working capital requirements at Mission Integration for a foreign military contract.    

  (2) Sensor Systems projected cash flow is expected to increase from $140 million in 2017 to $268 million in 2022. We expect projected cash flow levels to increase due to: (1) expected improvements in cash conversion rates at Warrior Systems due to timing of collection from international programs, (2) forecasted average annual sales growth of approximately 4%, primarily at Advanced Programs due to higher expected demand for lightweight unmanned undersea vehicles and (3) expected improvement in forecasted operating margins of approximately 90 basis points.   

A decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment and a related non-cash impairment charge against earnings if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  

As discussed above, the more significant assumptions used in our DCF valuations for each of our reporting units were detailed three-year undiscounted cash flow projections, risk adjusted discount rates, or WACC, used to discount the cash flow projections to their present value and expected Terminal Growth Rates. The current year (2018-2020) consolidated three-year undiscounted cash flow projections increased 21% compared to the prior year (2017-2019), with the changes by each reporting unit ranging from a decline of 13% to an increase of 93%. The risk adjusted  

36  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

discount rate, or WACC, increased by an average of 10 basis points compared to the prior year valuations primarily due to changes in the capital structure of business area-specific guideline public companies. The expected Terminal Growth Rates utilized in the current year valuations remain flat when compared with those utilized in the prior year valuations for all reporting units.  

As part of our annual impairment test, we evaluated the sensitivity of the DCF fair value estimates for each reporting unit, which were used for our goodwill impairment assessment, by separately assessing the impact on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by: (1) increasing the risk adjusted discount rate (WACC) by 50 basis points or (2) reducing the Terminal Growth Rate by 50 basis points, compared to those used in our estimated fair value calculations, while holding all other assumptions unchanged. All of our reporting units would have had a fair value in excess of their carrying value under both scenarios. In addition, we applied hypothetical decreases to the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units. We determined that a decrease in fair value of at least 30% would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value. 

As discussed previously, in addition to the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill may not be recoverable. Accordingly, depending on their outcomes, certain circumstances, such as the ability of the reporting units to: (1) achieve 2018 projected sales, operating income and cash flow and (2) win contract re-competitions and new business pursuits, may require us to review goodwill for impairment prior to the next annual assessment (November 30, 2018).  

Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations. The obligations for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long-term assumptions, including discount rates and expected mortality for employee benefit liabilities, rates of return on plan assets, expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants in the case of pension plans, and expected annual increases in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of postretirement benefit obligations. These long-term assumptions are subject to revision based on changes in interest rates, financial market conditions, expected versus actual returns on plan assets, expected participant mortality and other actuarial assumptions, including future rates of salary increases, benefit formulas and levels, and rates of increase in the costs of benefits. Changes in the assumptions, if significant, could materially affect the amount of annual net periodic benefit costs recognized in our results of operations from one year to the next, the liabilities for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans. Our pension expense for 2018 is expected to decrease by $11 million to $99 million from $110 million in 2017. Our discount rate assumption decreased from a weighted average rate of 4.40% at December 31, 2016 to 3.78% at December 31, 2017. The expected decrease in our 2018 pension expense is primarily due to higher expected asset returns due to an increase in plan asset balances compared to the prior year, partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average discount rate. 

In 2016, we changed the approach utilized to measure the service and interest cost components of expense for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Historically, we measured the service and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to use a spot rate approach for our plans in the measurement of the components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation. The estimated weighted average discount rates used to measure pension service and interest costs were 4.55% and 3.84% in 2017, respectively, compared to 4.83% and 3.95% in 2016, respectively. The previous method would have used a weighted average discount rate for both pension and service costs of 4.40% for 2017 and 4.67% for 2016, which represented the weighted average discount rate used to determine our benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change resulted in a reduction to pension expense of approximately $21 million in 2017 and $28 million in 2016 compared to the prior approach. This change did not result in a material impact to postretirement medical expense. See — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Pension Plans for a further discussion of our estimated 2018 pension expense. 

Discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense in any given period. The discount rate assumptions used to determine our pension and postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were based on a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the yield curve is required to have a rating  

37  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

of AA or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and/or Standard & Poors. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curve. For a sensitivity analysis projecting the impact of a change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense, see — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Pension Plans.  

Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had deferred tax assets of $493 million, a valuation allowance of $10 million and deferred tax liabilities of $638 million. The deferred tax assets included $12 million for loss carryforwards and $5 million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods. Deferred income taxes are determined separately for each of our tax-paying entities in each tax jurisdiction. The future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and, to a lesser extent, our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies. Based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income and tax planning strategies, we believe that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets, except for certain U.S. Federal, foreign and state net operating losses. A change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income, or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies, could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our deferred tax assets, and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and, if significant, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period.  

Liabilities for Pending and Threatened Litigation. We are subject to litigation, government investigations, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business or assumed in connection with certain business acquisitions. In accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies, we accrue a charge for a loss contingency when we believe it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is within a range of specified amounts, the most likely amount is accrued, and we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range represents a better estimate. Generally, we record the loss contingency at the amount we expect to pay to resolve the contingency and the amount is generally not discounted to the present value. Amounts recoverable under insurance contracts are recorded as assets when recovery is deemed probable. Contingencies that might result in a gain are not recognized until realizable. Changes to the amount of the estimated loss or resolution of one or more contingencies could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our litigation matters.  

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets. In addition to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with our business acquisitions, our long-lived assets also include property, plant and equipment, capitalized software development costs for software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, and certain long-term investments. At December 31, 2017, the consolidated carrying values of our property, plant and equipment were $1,110 million, capitalized software development costs were $57 million and certain long-term investments were $12 million. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment represented 9% of total assets, and the carrying value of our capitalized software development costs and certain long-term investments each represented less than 1% of total assets. We review the valuation of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value or net realizable value expected to result from the assets use and eventual disposition. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Long-lived assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, and other factors depending on the asset, including estimated future sales, profits and related cash flows, estimated product acceptance and product life cycles, changes in technology and customer demand, and the performance of invested companies and joint ventures. Changes in estimates and judgments on any of these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Consolidated Results of Operations  

The table below provides selected financial data, excluding discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2017 Compared with 2016  

Net Sales: For the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated net sales of $9,573 million increased $363 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales increased by $213 million, or 2%, to $9,369 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic sales exclude $204 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions and $54 million of sales declines related to business divestitures. For the year ended December 31, 2017, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $288 million, or 5%, to $6,642 million, and organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $75 million, or 3%, to $2,727 million. 

Sales from products increased by $280 million to $6,733 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6,453 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Product sales represented 70% of consolidated net sales for both of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Sales from products increased by: (1) $147 million primarily driven by Broadband Communication Systems due to increased deliveries of secure networked communication systems primarily for the U.S. DoD, (2) $120 million due to business acquisitions, net of divestitures, (3) $98 million for Total Training Solutions primarily due to higher volume on commercial flight simulators and training systems for the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and (4) $73 million for Precision Engagement Systems primarily due to increased deliveries of fuzing and ordnance products and higher volume for guidance and control products to the U.S. Army and U.S. USAF. These increases were partially offset by decreases of (1) $90 million for Mission Integration due to lower volume for international aircraft modifications, primarily international head-of-state aircraft and the procurement and delivery of two aircraft for a foreign military customer in 2016 compared to one for the USAF Compass Call Recap in the 2017, (2) $43 million due to reduced deliveries for UH-1Y aircraft cabin assemblies and (3) $25 million primarily due to fewer deliveries of enhanced night vision goggle products to the U.S. Army as contracts near completion. 

Sales from services increased by $83 million to $2,840 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2,757 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Service sales represented 30% of consolidated net sales for both of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Sales from services increased primarily by: (1) $37 million

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

for Total Training Solutions due to increased support services primarily to the USAF, (2) $31 million due to business acquisitions, net of divestitures and (3) $12 million due to higher volume of mission management software upgrades for the USAF. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of our segment sales trends. 

Operating income and operating margin: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $63 million, or 7%, to $1,020 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating margin was driven by: (1) 60 basis points primarily due to improved contract performance for Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and Sensor Systems and (2) 30 basis points at Sensor Systems for a settlement of the class action litigation and product return allowances recorded in 2016 that did not recur. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points due to severance and restructuring costs of $59 million, including a $12 million non-cash loss on the sale of a building in Sensor Systems and a $4 million pension curtailment charge in connection with the decision to discontinue future service accruals for substantially all salaried employee defined benefit plans effective January 1, 2019 (Pension Curtailment). See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends. 

Interest expense and other: Interest expense and other for the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by $4 million, primarily due to the absence of $7 million of debt retirement charges related to the redemption of: (1) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due November 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) in the second quarter of 2016 and (2) $350 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Senior Notes due May 28, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) in the fourth quarter of 2016. This decline was partially offset by higher average interest rates on outstanding debt. 

Effective income tax rate: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 11.7% from 21.3% for year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by: (1) $79 million of estimated tax benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform and (2) $30 million of tax benefits from a realignment of foreign legal entities to conform with our segment reporting structure. These increases were partially offset by $21 million for the reversal of previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters in 2016 that did not recur. 

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations: Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 increased 22% to $753 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $619 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 20% to $9.46 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.86 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted EPS for 2017 included $0.99 of estimated tax benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform. 

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding: Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to changes in the dilutive impact of common share equivalents, primarily caused by a higher L3 stock price. 

2016 Compared with 2015  

Net Sales: For the year ended December 31, 2016, consolidated net sales of $9,210 million decreased $21 million, or 0.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $95 million, or 1%. Organic sales exclude $209 million related to business divestitures and $93 million from business acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $270 million, or 4%, to $6,382 million, and organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $175 million, or 6%, to $2,735 million. 

Sales from products decreased by $147 million to $6,453 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6,600 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Product sales represented 70% and 71% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales from products declined by $156 million due to the divestiture of MSI on May 29, 2015 and $86 million in the Space & Power Systems sector primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial satellites. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $49 million in the Broadband Communication Systems sector primarily due to increased volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems for the DoD and $46 million primarily at Security & Detection Systems due to deliveries of airport security screening systems to international customers and commercial aviation recorders products. 

Sales from services increased by $126 million to $2,757 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2,631 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Service sales represented 30% and 29% of  

40  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales from services increased by $72 million due to the CTC Aviation Group (L3 CTC), L3 ForceX and Aerosim business acquisitions and $54 million primarily for Broadband Communication Systems due to increased volume for logistics support services for the DoD. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of our segment sales trends. 

Operating income and operating margin: Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $172 million to $957 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $95 million, or 11%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Segment operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Segment operating margin increased by: (1) 90 basis points due to losses in 2015 at Aerospace Systems on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts which did not recur and (2) 50 basis points due to lower pension expense of $45 million. These increases were partially offset by sales mix changes. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

Interest expense and other: Interest expense and other for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7 million of debt retirement charges related to the redemption of: (1) $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes in the second quarter of 2016 and (2) $350 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Effective income tax rate: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to 21.3% from 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the effective income tax rate was driven by lower foreign tax benefits and lower Federal Research and Experimentation tax credits in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by a benefit of $17 million due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard related to income tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation awards.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and diluted EPS from continuing operations: Net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $619 million, compared to $492 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $7.86 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.01 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations: Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 increased 11% to $619 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 16% to $7.86.  

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding: Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 declined by 4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to repurchases of L3 common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, partially offset by additional shares issued in connection with various employee stock-based compensation programs and contributions to employee savings plans made in common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table below presents a reconciliation of: (1) net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 to adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L3 and (2) diluted EPS from continuing operations to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (3) Adjusted diluted EPS is diluted EPS attributable to L3's common stockholders, excluding the goodwill impairment charges and charges or credits relating to business divestitures. Adjusted net income attributable to L3 is net income attributable to L3, excluding the goodwill impairment charges and charges or credits relating to business divestitures. These amounts are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that the goodwill impairment charges and charges or credits relating to business divestitures affect the comparability of the results of operations for 2017 and 2016 to the results of operations for 2015. We also believe that disclosing net income and diluted EPS excluding the goodwill impairment charges and charges or credits relating to business divestitures will allow investors to more easily compare the 2017 and 2016 results to the 2015 results. However, these measures may not be defined or calculated by other companies in the same manner.   

  (4) Amounts may not recalculate directly due to rounding.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

2016 Compared with 2015  

Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $17 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Sales increases at Mission Integration were due to: (1) $107 million primarily due to the procurement and delivery of two business jets to foreign military customers in the 2016 second quarter, (2) $74 million due to higher volume for special mission aircraft and large ISR aircraft systems primarily for the U.S. Government, (3) $40 million due to higher volume for small ISR aircraft systems primarily for the U.S. Army and (4) $35 million primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016 on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. These increases were partially offset by decreases at Mission Integration of: (1) $148 million for large ISR aircraft systems for foreign military customers as contracts near completion and (2) $91 million for small ISR aircraft fleet management services to the USAF due to reduced demand resulting from the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $62 million, or 32%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating margin increased by 210 basis points to 8.7%. Operating margin increased by: (1) 370 basis points primarily due to net aggregate unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015, which included $101 million of cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016 and (2) 50 basis points due to improved performance on the Army C-12 contract due to better terms on the new contract which began August 1, 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases of (1) 140 basis points due to net aggregate favorable contract performance adjustments primarily for large ISR systems in the year ended December 31, 2015 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016 and (2) 70 basis points primarily due to sales mix changes for ISR systems. 

Communication Systems  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2017 Compared with 2016  

Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $176 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by Broadband Communication Systems due to increased deliveries of secure networked communication systems primarily for the U.S. DoD. 

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $17 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating margin remained the same at 9.5%. Improved contract performance, primarily at Broadband Communication Systems, increased operating margin by 160 basis points. These increases were partially offset by 130 basis points due to mix changes primarily for Space & Power Systems. Consolidation activities primarily related to the traveling wave tube businesses further reduced operating margin by 30 basis points consisting of severance and restructuring costs of $48 million partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $42 million on the sale of the companys property in San Carlos, California in the second quarter of 2017. 

2016 Compared with 2015  

Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $11 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales decreased by $4 million, or 0.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales exclude $15 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. The decrease was due to: (1) $88 million in the Space & Power Systems, primarily due to reduced demand for power devices for commercial satellites, and (2) $64 million in the Broadband Communication Systems due to fewer deliveries on a satellite communications (SATCOM) land terminals contract for the ADF, which was completed in the second quarter of 2016. These decreases were largely offset by increases of $109 million in the Broadband Communication Systems primarily due to increased volume and deliveries of secure networked communication systems for the DoD and $39 million primarily for increased volume and deliveries to the DoD of mobile and ground-based SATCOM systems for the U.S. military. 

45  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 9.5%. Operating margin increased by 60 basis points due to lower pension expense of $13 million, partially offset primarily due to sales mix changes.  

Sensor Systems  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2017 Compared with 2016  

Sensor Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $79 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales increased by $53 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales exclude $26 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions. Organic sales increased primarily due to increased task order volume on U.S. Government contracts, higher volume for space electronics products and increased deliveries of airborne turret systems to the USAF. These increases were partially offset by fewer deliveries of enhanced night vision goggle products to the U.S. Army as contracts near completion. 

Sensor Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $48 million, or 33%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating margin increased by 260 basis points to 12.6%. Operating margin increased by: (1) 180 basis points for a settlement of the class action litigation and product return allowances recorded in 2016 that did not recur at EoTech, (2) 120 basis points primarily for improved contract performance at Maritime Sensor Systems, (3) 30 basis points due to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory recorded in 2016 that did not recur and (4) 20 basis points primarily due to higher sales volume. These increases were partially offset by 70 basis points due to a $12 million loss on the sale of a building during the 2017 fourth quarter in anticipation of consolidating two focal plane array foundries during 2018 and 2019 and 20 basis points due to severance costs of $3 million. 

2016 Compared with 2015  

Sensor Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $22 million, or 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales increased $30 million, or 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Organic sales exclude $16 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions and $24 million of sales declines related to business divestitures. Organic sales increased primarily due to increased deliveries for infrared detection and space electronics products to the USAF and higher volume for hybrid electric drive contracts and photonics masts products to the USN.  

Sensor Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 10.0%. Operating margin increased by 90 basis points primarily for improved contract performance at Space & Sensor Systems and Airborne Sensor Systems. This increase was partially offset by 40 basis points for a settlement of the class action litigation and product returns allowance recorded in 2016 at EoTech and 30 basis points due to lower margins related to acquisitions and divestitures.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Anticipated Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  

At December 31, 2017, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $662 million. While no amounts of the cash and cash equivalents are considered restricted, $286 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of cash held in non-U.S. jurisdictions is subject to local capital requirements. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations, cash on hand and our five-year unsecured $1 billion revolving credit facility (Credit Facility), which we entered into on October 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, we had the full availability of our Credit Facility. We generated $985 million of net cash from operating activities from continuing  

46  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, and we received net cash proceeds of $74 million substantially all from the sale of the property in San Carlos, California, and $18 million primarily from the divestitures of Coleman and Aviation Jet Services. Significant cash uses during the year ended December 31, 2017 included $316 million related to the business acquisitions, $236 million related to the payment of dividends, $224 million related to capital expenditures and $180 million related to repurchasing shares of our common stock.  

We currently believe that our cash from operating activities generated during the year, together with our cash on hand and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, defined benefit plan contributions, commitments, contingencies, research and development expenditures, select business acquisitions (depending on the size), program and other discretionary investments, interest payments, income tax payments, L3 dividends and share repurchases. 

Balance Sheet  

Billed receivables increased by $23 million to $723 million at December 31, 2017, from $700 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the timing of billings and collections for Total Training Solutions and Broadband Communication Systems, $13 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and $10 million for business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by decreases for Warrior Sensor Systems and Advanced Communications and $14 million for assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017. 

Contracts in process increased by $75 million to $1,933 million at December 31, 2017, from $1,858 million at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, contracts in process increased: (1) $32 million for business acquisitions, (2) $15 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and (3) $70 million comprised of: 

  • increases of $47 million in inventoried contract costs primarily due to the timing of deliveries for Space & Power Systems and Airborne Sensor Systems, and   

  • increases of $23 million in unbilled contract receivables primarily due to sales exceeding billings for Total Training Solutions and Broadband Communication Systems, partially offset by billings exceeding sales for Mission Integration and Power & Propulsion Systems.   

These increases were partially offset by $33 million for assets classified as held for sale, and $10 million due to the Coleman divestiture. 

L3s receivables days sales outstanding (DSO) was 70 at December 31, 2017, compared with 69 at December 31, 2016. We calculate our DSO by dividing: (1) our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables by (2) our trailing 12-month sales adjusted, on a pro forma basis, to include sales from business acquisitions and exclude sales from business divestitures that we completed as of the end of the period, discontinued operations and sales from our Aerostructures and Doss Aviations Aviation Services businesses, which are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017, multiplied by the number of calendar days in the trailing 12-month period (365 days at December 31, 2017 and 366 days at December 31, 2016). Our trailing 12-month pro forma sales were $9,508 million at December 31, 2017 and $9,354 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in DSO during 2017 was primarily due to an increase in billed and unbilled receivables, which is discussed above, partially offset by the increase in our trailing 12-month pro forma sales. 

Inventories increased by $59 million to $389 million at December 31, 2017 from $330 million at December 31, 2016, due to acquisitions, primarily the ETD business acquisition and for Warrior Sensor Systems and Security & Detection Systems to support customer demand. 

The increase in other current assets was primarily due to an advance payment by Mission Integration for long lead material on a foreign military contract and income tax receivable benefits due to restructuring of international subsidiaries and additional depreciation deductions from U.S. Tax Reform. 

The increase in property, plant and equipment was primarily due to capital expenditures and $27 million for business acquisitions, primarily Doss Aviation and G-Air, barely exceeding depreciation expense, $43 million of dispositions, primarily the sale of the property in San Carlos, California and a $41 million decrease primarily for assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Goodwill increased by $241 million to $6,615 million at December 31, 2017 from $6,374 million at December 31, 2016. The table below presents the changes in goodwill by segment.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) Business acquisitions for the Electronic Systems segment included the acquisitions of the ETD, Doss Aviation and G-Air businesses and the purchase price allocation adjustments for the MacH and Aerosim business acquisitions. Business acquisitions for the Sensor Systems segment included primarily the Adaptive Methods, Open Water Power, OceanServer and Kigre business acquisitions.   

  (2) The decrease for the Electronic Systems segment was due to the divestitures of Coleman and Aviation Jet Services during the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017.   

  (3) The Aerostructures businesses from the Aerospace Systems segment are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2017.   

The increase in identifiable intangible assets was due to $114 million of intangible assets recognized related to the business acquisitions, primarily the Open Water Power, ETD, Doss Aviation, Adaptive Methods, Kigre, OceanServer and G-Air business acquisitions, partially offset by the Aviation Jet Services business divestiture, as well as amortization expense.  

The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of when invoices for purchases from third party vendors and subcontractors were received and payments were made.  

Accrued employment costs increased primarily due to increased severance as a result of headcount reductions and $7 million from business acquisitions. 

Other current liabilities decreased primarily due to the payment related to the securities class action settlement of $14 million in the third quarter of 2017 and the resolution of contractual offset obligations, partially offset by $11 million of estimated contingent purchase price payable for the Open Water Power business acquisition. 

The decrease in deferred tax liabilities was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred taxes for U.S. Tax Reform, partially offset by increases for the acquisition of non-deductible in-process research and development during 2017 and the amortization of certain goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for tax purposes.  

The increase in other liabilities was due to a $27 million increase in non-current income taxes payable related to uncertain income tax positions and $15 million related to the Toll Charge in accordance with U.S. Tax Reform. 

Pension Plans  

L3 maintains defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 24% of employees. At December 31, 2017, L3s projected benefit obligation (PBO), which includes accumulated benefits plus the incremental benefits attributable to projected future salary increases for covered employees, was $4,228 million and exceeded the fair value of L3s pension plan assets of $3,047 million by $1,181 million. At December 31, 2016, L3s PBO was $3,758 million and exceeded the fair value of L3s pension plan assets of $2,721 million by $1,037 million. The $144 million increase in our unfunded status was primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average discount rate from 4.40% at December 31, 2016 to 3.78% at December 31, 2017, partially offset by an increase in plan asset balances due to asset returns. 

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption represents the average rate that we expect to earn over the long-term on the assets of our benefit plans, including those from dividends, interest income and capital appreciation. We utilize a third party consultant to assist in the development of the expected long-term return on plan assets, which is based on expectations regarding future long-term rates of return for the plans investment portfolio, with consideration given to the allocation of investments by asset class and historical and forward looking rates of return for each individual asset class. With respect to the determination of our expected long-term return on plan assets assumption for the year ended December 31, 2017, we considered: (1) a 20-year forward looking return on plan  

48  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

assets as developed with the assistance of our third party consultant, which is currently 8.03% for our U.S. plans and 7.25% for our Canadian plans, and (2) our historical returns. While we review historical rates of return on our plan assets, the substantial volatility in any one year can result in historical data that is less indicative of future returns. Accordingly, we give greater consideration toward forward looking returns in developing our expected long-term return on plan assets assumption. In reviewing our historical returns, we noted that the average annual return on our U.S. pension plan assets over the period since L3s formation in 1997 through 2016, net of investment management fees and determined on an arithmetic basis, was 7.00%. Arithmetic annual averages represent the simple average returns over independent annual periods. In addition, the actual annual returns have exceeded our long-term return on plan assets assumption in 13 of the past 20 years since L3s formation. The long-term return on plan assets assumption of 8.00% for our U.S. plans and 7.25% for our Canadian plans did not change. Based on the forward looking and historical returns on our plan assets discussed above and an allotment for active management, we believe our weighted average long-term return on plan assets assumption in 2017 of 7.92% continues to be within a reasonable range.  

We recorded net actuarial losses of $200 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average discount rate, which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Actuarial gains and losses in a period represent the difference between actual and actuarially assumed experience, primarily due to discount rates and pension plan asset returns. Actuarial gains and losses that our pension plans experience are not recognized in pension expense in the year incurred, but rather are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The accumulated gains and losses in excess of a corridor, defined as the greater of 10% of the fair value of a plans assets and 10% of its projected benefit obligation, are generally amortized to pension expense in future periods over the estimated average remaining service periods of the covered employees. See Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans.  

Our pension expense for 2017 was $110 million, including a $4 million curtailment charge in connection with managements decision to discontinue future service accruals for substantially all salaried employee pension plans effective January 1, 2019. We currently expect pension expense for 2018 to decrease $11 million to approximately $99 million primarily due to higher asset returns caused by an increase in plan asset balances compared to the prior year, partially offset by the decrease in our weighted average discount rate.  

Our pension expense for 2018 may be different from our current expectations when finalized due to a number of factors, including the effect of any future business acquisitions and divestitures for which we assume liabilities for pension benefits, changes in headcount at our businesses that sponsor pension plans, actual pension plan contributions and changes (if any) to our pension assumptions for 2018, including the discount rate, mortality rates, expected long-term return on plan assets and salary increases.  

We expect our pension expense to decrease significantly in 2019 and future years due to the elimination of future service accruals for substantially all salaried employee pension plan participants and reduced amortization of actuarial losses due to an expected change in the amortization period from the estimated remaining service periods to the estimated remaining expected lifetime of the covered employees. The actual decrease in pension expense will be based on the same factors discussed above, including changes (if any) to our pension assumptions for 2019 and future years.  

Our cash pension contributions for 2017 were $97 million, and we currently expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans in 2018. Actual 2018 pension contributions could be affected by changes in the funded status of our pension plans during 2018. A substantial portion of our pension plan contributions for L3s businesses that are U.S. Government contractors are recoverable as allowable indirect contract costs at amounts generally equal to the annual pension contributions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Our projected benefit obligation and annual pension expense are significantly affected by, holding all other assumptions constant, certain actuarial assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a change in certain assumptions for our pension plans and resulting increase (decrease) to the 2018 expected pension expense and PBO at December 31, 2017.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Statement of Cash Flows  

The table below provides a summary of our cash flows from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities — Continuing Operations  

2017 Compared with 2016. We generated $985 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $37 million compared with $1,022 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by higher income tax payments. The net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities is further discussed above under Balance Sheet.  

2016 Compared with 2015. We generated $1,022 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $13 million compared with $1,035 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to primarily refund payments in connection with the product return allowances at EoTech.  

Interest Payments. Our cash from operating activities included interest payments on debt of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our interest expense also included amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond discounts, which are non-cash items.  

Investing Activities — Continuing Operations  

During 2017, we used $453 million of cash from investing activities, which included $316 million for business acquisitions discussed above under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and $224 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $74 million of cash generated primarily from the sale of the property in San Carlos, California and $18 million from business divestitures.  

During 2016, we used $10 million of cash from investing activities, which included $388 million for business acquisitions discussed above under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and $210 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $561 million of cash received from business divestitures (primarily NSS). 

During 2015, we used $190 million of cash primarily to: (1) acquire three businesses discussed above under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures for $320 million and (2) pay $195 million for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds received of $318 million from the MSI, BSI, Tinsley Product Line and Klein divestitures.

Financing Activities — Continuing Operations  

Debt  

At December 31, 2017, total outstanding debt was $3,330 million, compared to $3,325 million at December 31, 2016, all of which was senior debt. At December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility. Accordingly, we had the full availability of our $1 billion facility for future borrowings. We also had $416 million of outstanding standby letters of credit with financial institutions covering performance and financial guarantees per contractual requirements with certain customers at December 31, 2017. These standby letters of credit may be drawn upon in the event that we do not perform on certain of our contractual requirements. At December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt matures between October 15, 2019 and December 15, 2026. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the components of our debt at December 31, 2017.  

We consider our credit rating as an important element of our capital allocation strategy and, while no assurances can be given, we intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our senior unsecured credit rating from both Standard and Poors and Fitch Ratings is BBB- with a stable outlook, and our senior unsecured credit rating from Moodys Investors Service is Baa3 with a stable outlook. 

Repurchases, Redemptions, and Maturities of Senior Notes 

The repurchases, redemptions and maturities of Senior Notes are presented in the table below. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the redemption provisions of our outstanding Senior Notes. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) The 1.50% Senior Notes due 2017 were redeemed at a price equal to 100.323% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Interest ceased to accrue on and after the redemption date.   

  (2) The 3.95% Senior Notes due 2016 were redeemed at a price equal to 101.475% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest ceased to accrue on and after May 20, 2016, and the only remaining right of holders of such Notes was to receive payment of the redemption price and accrued interest.   

Debt Covenants and Other Provisions. The Credit Facility and Senior Notes contain financial and/or other restrictive covenants. See Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt, related financial covenants and cross default provisions. We were in compliance with our financial and other restrictive covenants at December 31, 2017.  

Guarantees. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L3 and by substantially all of the material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries of L3 on an unsecured senior basis. The payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured senior basis, jointly and severally, by L3s material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of its other indebtedness. The guarantees of the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes rank pari passu with each other.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Equity  

During 2017 and 2016, L3s Board of Directors authorized the following quarterly cash dividends:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $236 million of cash dividends. Payments of previously accrued dividends for employee held stock awards were offset by accrued dividends to be paid in future periods.   

  (2) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $220 million of cash dividends. Payments of previously accrued dividends for employee held stock awards were offset by accrued dividends to be paid in future periods.   

L3 repurchased $180 million, or 1.0 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2017, $373 million, or 3.0 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $740 million, or 6.4 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

On February 12, 2018, L3 announced that its Board of Directors had increased L3s regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.75 per share to $0.80 per share, or 7%, payable on March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2018.  

The number of holders of record of L3s common stock on February 16, 2018 was approximately 197,000. On February 16, 2018, the closing price of L3s common stock as reported by the NYSE was $212.89 per share.  

Contractual Obligations  

The table below presents our estimated total contractual obligations from our continuing operations at December 31, 2017, including the amounts expected to be paid or settled for each of the periods indicated below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) Represents principal amount of debt and only includes scheduled principal payments.   

  (2) Represents expected interest payments on L3’s debt balance at December 31, 2017 using the stated interest rate on our fixed rate debt, assuming that current borrowings remain outstanding to the contractual maturity date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

  (3) Non-cancelable operating leases are presented net of estimated sublease rental income.    

  (4) Includes the residual value guarantee for three real estate lease agreements, expiring on August 31, 2020, that are accounted for as operating leases. We have the right to exercise options under the lease agreements to renew the leases, to purchase the properties for $45 million or sell the properties on behalf of the lessor. If we elect to sell the properties, we must pay the lessor a residual value guarantee of $39 million. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases.    

  (5) Represents open purchase orders at December 31, 2017 for amounts expected to be paid for goods or services that are legally binding.   

  (6) Represents the portion of the $22 million estimated Toll Charge that is payable as of December 31, 2017. Under U.S. Tax Reform, the Toll Charge will be paid over an eight-year period.   

  (7) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of workers compensation and deferred compensation for the years ending December 31, 2019 and thereafter and also include pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions that we expect to pay in 2018.   

  (8) Our pension and postretirement benefit plan funding policy is generally to contribute in accordance with cost accounting standards that affect government contractors, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereon. For 2018, we expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans and approximately $10 million to our postretirement benefit plans. Due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension and postretirement benefit plan funding, we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of one year and we may decide or be required to contribute more than we expect to our pension and postretirement benefit plans.   

  (9) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits in connection with uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken on our income tax returns as of December 31, 2017 since we cannot determine the time period of future tax consequences. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements.   

We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. The costs to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The ability to recover investments that we make are generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2017, the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled $1.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aerospace Systems segment, some of which extend through 2028. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2017 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $89 million at December 31, 2017, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The table below presents our estimated total contingent commitments and other guarantees at December 31, 2017, including the amounts expected to be paid or settled for each of the periods indicated below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (3) The total amount does not include residual value guarantees for two real estate lease agreements, expiring on August 31, 2020, that are accounted for as operating leases. We have the right to exercise options under the lease agreements to purchase both properties for $45 million on or before August 31, 2020. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases.    

  (4) The total amount does not include the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the future potential earn-out payments related to the MacH and Open Water Power acquisitions. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value of the contingent consideration.   

  (5) The total does not include future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases.    

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  

We are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the U.S. Government and, to a lesser degree, under foreign government contracts, some of which are funded by the U.S. Government. All such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, and, periodically, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations, an indictment by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. A conviction, or an administrative finding that satisfies the requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We are currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations, none of which we anticipate will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. Also, we have been periodically subject to litigation, government investigations, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business. We accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For a description of our legal proceedings and contingencies, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

We continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost that we will incur to comply with these laws, based upon available internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries, if any, there are no environmental loss contingencies that, in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Derivative Financial Instruments and Other Market Risk  

Included in our derivative financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts. All of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading.  

Interest Rate Risk. Our Credit Facility is subject to variable interest and is therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. The interest rates on the Senior Notes are fixed-rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates. Additional data on our debt obligations and our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we would pay on borrowings under the Credit Facility, if any, are provided in Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. Our U.S. and foreign businesses enter into contracts with customers, subcontractors or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. To protect the functional currency equivalent cash flows associated with certain of these contracts, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are generally designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2017, our foreign currency forward contracts had maturities ranging through 2023, a notional value of $307 million and a corresponding net fair value that was an asset of $10 million.  

Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented  

For a discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Inflation  

The effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant. Although a majority of our sales are made under long-term contracts (revenue arrangements), the selling prices of such contracts, established for deliveries in the future, generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods. In addition, some of our contracts provide for price adjustments through cost escalation clauses.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations, cash flows, financial position, economic performance and financial condition, including in particular, the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.  

All statements other than historical facts may be forward-looking statements, such as may, will, should, likely, projects, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. We caution investors that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: our dependence on the defense industry; backlog processing and program slips resulting from delayed awards and/or funding from the DoD and other major customers; the U.S. Government fiscal situation; changes in DoD budget levels and spending priorities; U.S. Government failure to raise the debt ceiling; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of customers and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding many of our contracts; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts; our ability to successfully compete for and win new business; or, identify, acquire and integrate additional businesses; our ability to maintain and improve our operating margin; the availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; the outcome of litigation matters; results of audits by U.S. Government agencies and of ongoing governmental investigations; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements and actions taken by rating agencies that could result in a downgrade of our debt; our ability to continue to recruit, retain and train our employees; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and equity based compensation, as well as the market performance of benefit plan assets; our collective bargaining agreements; our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; the risk that our commercial aviation products and services businesses are affected by a downturn in global demand for air travel or a reduction in commercial aircraft OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) production rates; the DoDs Better Buying Power and other efficiency initiatives; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our ability to perform contracts on schedule; our international operations including currency risks and compliance with foreign laws; our extensive use of fixed-price type revenue arrangements; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in which our businesses participate; risks relating to technology and data security; our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; the impact on our business of improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners; goodwill impairments and the fair values of our assets; and the ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations.  

In addition, for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors and Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements, in each case included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and any material updates to these factors contained in any of our future filings.  

Readers of this document are cautioned that our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.  

As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions
