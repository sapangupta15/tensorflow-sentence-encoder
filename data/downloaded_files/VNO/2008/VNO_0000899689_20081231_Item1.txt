 OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

   

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;    

   

Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;    

   

Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;    

   

Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;    

   

Investing in fully-integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and    

   

Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value.     

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. 

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

In the second half of 2007 the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub-prime mortgages, declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide. In 2008, the credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets. We are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses, including ours. During the past year, real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen. Our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies, which may result in lower average occupancy rates and effective rents, and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. In addition, the value of our assets, including investments in joint ventures, marketable securities, and mezzanine loans may also decline, and may result in impairment charges and/or valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations.  

ACQUISTIONS 

There were no material real estate acquisitions or investments in partially owned entities and mezzanine loans during 2008.

DISPOSITIONS 

On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment, for $220,000,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000.  

On June 6, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex located in Tysons Corner, Virginia for approximately $152,800,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000.  

Pursuant to the sale of GMH Communities L.P. (GMH) military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc (ACC) (NYSE: ACC), in June 2008 we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACCs then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH. We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares. The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000. The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its disposition was $77,000,000. 

FINANCING ACTIVITIES 

During 2008 we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $241,000,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds. In addition, we purchased $81,540,000 (aggregate face amount) of our 4.50% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009, for $80,408,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $783,000. We also purchased $10,200,000 and $17,300,000 (aggregate face amounts) of our 3.63% and 2.85% convertible senior debentures, respectively, for an aggregate of $18,080,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $9,037,000.  

The net proceeds we received from dispositions and financings above were used primarily for general corporate purposes. We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future.

 DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 

We are currently engaged in various development/redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.2 billion. Of this amount, $393.4 million was expended prior to 2008 and $411.5 million was expended during 2008. Substantially all of the estimated costs to complete our development projects are anticipated to be expended during 2009, of which $266.1 million is expected to be funded by existing construction loans. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We are evaluating other development opportunities for which final plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined.  

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget.

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter-by-quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.  

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. 

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES 

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long-term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

EMPLOYEES  

As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately 3,529 employees, of which 340 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 106 employees and an additional 2,054 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services to New York Office properties. The Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart segments have 222, 190 and 585 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 523 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexanders, in which we own 32.7% and 32.5%, respectively.

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys.
