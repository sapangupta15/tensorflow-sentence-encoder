Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. 

VorNADO CAPITAL PARTNERS REAL ESTATE FUND (The “FUND”) 

In February 2011, the Fund’s subscription period closed with an aggregate of $800,000,000 of capital commitments, of which we committed $200,000,000. We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund, which has an eight-year term and a three-year investment period. During the investment period, which concludes in July 2013, the Fund is our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit within its investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such investments; (v) non-controlling interests in equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North America. The Fund’s investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis of accounting.  

During 2012, the Fund made four investments (described below) aggregating $203,700,000. As of December 31, 2012, the Fund has nine investments with an aggregate fair value of $600,786,000, or $67,642,000 in excess of cost, and has remaining unfunded commitments of $217,676,000, of which our share was $54,419,000.

On August 20, 2012, the Fund acquired 501 Broadway, a 9,000 square foot retail property in New York for $31,000,000. The purchase price consisted of $11,000,000 in cash and a $20,000,000 mortgage loan. The three-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a floor of 3.50%, and has two one-year extension options. 

 1100 Lincoln Road 

On July 2, 2012, the Fund acquired 1100 Lincoln Road, a 167,000 square foot retail property, the western anchor of the Lincoln Road Shopping District in Miami Beach, Florida, for $132,000,000.

ACQUISITIONS and investments 

Independence Plaza 

In 2011, we acquired a 51% interest in the subordinated debt of Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,328 unit residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan which has 54,500 square feet of retail space and 550 parking spaces, for $45,000,000 and a warrant to purchase 25% of the equity for $1,000,000. On December 21, 2012, we acquired a 58.75% interest in the property as follows: (i) buying one of the equity partners’ 33.75% interest for $160,000,000, (ii) exercising our warrant for 25% of the equity and (iii) contributing the appreciated value of our interest in the subordinated debt as preferred equity. In connection therewith, we recognized income of $105,366,000, comprised of $60,396,000 from the accelerated amortization of the discount on the subordinated debt immediately preceding the conversion to preferred equity, and a $44,970,000 purchase price fair value adjustment upon exercising the warrant. The current transaction values the property at $844,800,000. The property is currently encumbered by a $334,225,000 mortgage. We expect to refinance the $334,225,000 mortgage in 2013, substantially decreasing our cash investment. We manage the retail space at the property and Stellar Management, our partner, manages the residential space. 

666 Fifth Avenue - Retail  

On December 6, 2012, we acquired a retail condominium located at 666 Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street for $707,000,000 in cash.

Marriott Marquis Times Square - Retail and Signage 

On July 30, 2012, we entered into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) (“Host”), under which we will redevelop the retail and signage components of the Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel. The Marriott Marquis with over 1,900 rooms is one of the largest hotels in Manhattan. It is located in the heart of the bow-tie of Times Square and spans the entire block front from 45th Street to 46th Street on Broadway. The Marriott Marquis is directly across from our 1540 Broadway iconic retail property leased to Forever 21 and Disney flagship stores. We plan to spend over $140,000,000 to redevelop and substantially expand the existing retail space, including converting the below grade parking garage into retail, and creating six-story, 300 foot wide block front, dynamic LED signs. During the term of the lease we will pay fixed rent equal to the sum of $12,500,000, plus a portion of the property’s net cash flow after we receive a 5.2% preferred return on our invested capital. The lease contains put/call options which, if exercised, would lead to our ownership. Host can exercise the put option during defined periods following the conversion of the project to a condominium. We can exercise our call option under the same terms, at any time after the fifteenth year of the lease term.

Development and Redevelopment Projects  

In 2012, we commenced the re-tenanting and repositioning of 280 Park Avenue (50% owned), and the renovation of the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall, both of which are expected to be substantially completed in 2014. We budgeted approximately $285,000,000 for these projects, of which $31,000,000 was expended in 2012 and $132,000,000 is expected to be expended in 2013 and the balance is expected to be expended in 2014. 

During 2012, we completed the demolition of the existing residential building down to the second-level, at 220 Central Park South. 

In addition, we continued lobby renovations at several of our office buildings in New York and Washington, as well as the re-tenanting and repositioning of a number of our strip shopping centers.  

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, including the Hotel Pennsylvania and in Washington, including 1900 Crystal Drive, Rosslyn and Pentagon City. 

In 2010, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district. The County is funding the development of the Facility, using the proceeds it received from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $418,000,000 and maintains effective control of the property. During the 17-year development and operating period, our subsidiaries will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which are net of a $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County. Our subsidiaries’ obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by our subsidiaries only to the extent that they first receive at least an equal payment from the County. Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013. As of December 31, 2012, $379,658,000 of the $418,000,000 development budget was expended.  

There can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget. 

sTop & SHop settlement  

On February 6, 2013, we received $124,000,000 pursuant to a settlement agreement with Stop & Shop for our claim under a 1992 agreement which provided for additional annual rent of $6,000,000 for a period potentially through 2031. The settlement terminates our right to receive this rent under the 1992 agreement and ends litigation between the parties, which started ten years ago. In prior years, we recognized $47,900,000 of rental income under the agreement. This settlement will result in $59,000,000 of net income that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013.

SEGMENT DATA 

We operate in the following business segments: New York, Washington, DC, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart and Toys “R” Us (“Toys”). Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is set forth in Note 26 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Toys segment has 651 locations internationally.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income. 

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. 

Certain Activities 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2012, we have approximately 4,428 employees, of which 327 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,308 employees, including 2,641 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 516 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart segments have 456, 110 and 227 employees, respectively. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.6% and 32.4%, respectively.
