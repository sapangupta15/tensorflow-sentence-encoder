Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (IPG, we, us or our). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. Our MD&A includes the following sections:  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds and debt ratings.  

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2010 and certain accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our future operations.  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

During 2010, we have seen economic recovery in various key markets and an increase in spending from many of our clients in multiple business sectors. As a result, we have experienced growth across our marketing disciplines. Where we see strategic opportunity, we are continuing to invest in talent to support growth. We have achieved improved operating leverage in 2010 as a result of higher revenues while maintaining our ongoing cost discipline. A degree of caution on the part of marketers continues to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services, particularly in light of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy. However, we continue to derive benefits from our diversified client base, global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on growth. The following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the same periods in 2009 and 2008.

When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. The performance metrics that we use to analyze our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector, where we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitutes approximately 55%-60% of our consolidated revenues. We also analyze revenue by geographic region.  

The change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk. As a result, both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. The primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2010 include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar and Euro. During 2010, the U.S. Dollar weakened against several foreign currencies as compared to the prior-year period, which had a net positive impact on our 2010 consolidated results of operations. This effect was partially offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro and Pound Sterling during 2010. For 2010, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 1% in revenues, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses, which contributed on a net basis to an increase in operating income of approximately 3% compared to the prior-year period. For 2009, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 4% in revenues and operating expenses, which contributed to a net decrease in operating income of approximately 4% compared to the prior-year period.  

For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. During the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. For 2010 and 2009, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the respective prior-year period. For additional information on our acquisitions, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Revenue Recognition  

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising, marketing and communications programs in various media around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts  

15  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.  

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.  

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred.  

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs. We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing) where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses. Revenue is generally reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.  

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.  

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned. Income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2004 Restatement). In these situations, and given the historical nature of these liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or expense as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results.

Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes.  

We are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings. A valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. In circumstances where there is significant negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance. Conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings. In 2010 and 2008 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of $2.4 and $48.0, respectively. In 2009 we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of $12.4.  

The authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.  

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

We have accounted for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method beginning in 2009, while we utilized the purchase accounting method in prior years. Both accounting methods require us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.  

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 11 reporting units that were subject to the 2010 annual impairment testing. Our reporting unit structure changed from 2009 due to the movement of four reporting units into other existing reporting units based on operational decisions by management during 2010. Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1, 2010 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units.  

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. These assets  

17  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.  

The authoritative guidance for goodwill specifies a two-step process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.  

The fair value of a reporting unit for 2010 and 2009 was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We primarily applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.  

These estimates and assumptions vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For 2010, the discount rates we used for our reporting units were between 11.5% and 13.0%. The terminal value growth rates for our reporting units were between 3.0% and 3.5%. The terminal value growth rates represent the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy. For 2010, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 5.0% and 6.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.  

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 0.5% and increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 0.5% and decreases discount rates by 0.5%. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test.

The following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2010 and 2009 annual impairment reviews and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end, average and high end of the valuation range for a) fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10%, b) fair values exceeding carrying values between 10% and 20%, c) fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20% and d) carrying values that exceed fair value.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1 We did not test five reporting units in 2010 because we determined we could carry forward the fair value of the reporting unit from previous annual tests, as the fair value significantly exceeded the book value.  

 2 We did not test two reporting units in 2009 because we determined we could carry forward the fair value of the reporting unit from the previous annual test, as the fair value significantly exceeded the book value.  

 3  We used the average fair value for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test.   

The table above displays the information related to our 2010 and 2009 annual impairment tests. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test. In 2010, our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair value. For 2010, using the average fair value there was one reporting unit whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, and there was $150.0 of goodwill associated with this reporting unit. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the low and high end of the valuation range. Using the low end of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair values. There were two reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%, and there was $589.2 of goodwill associated with these reporting units. Using the high end of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair values or whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%.  

In 2009, our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that one reporting units carrying value exceeded its fair value, and there was $6.1 of goodwill associated with that reporting unit. As

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 a result, we were required to perform the second step of the impairment test. Under the second step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated among its assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. We did not record an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009, as we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was greater than the carrying value for this reporting unit. Additionally, no carrying value adjustment was made to the intangible assets for this reporting unit as the estimated cash flows were greater than the carrying value of these assets on an undiscounted basis. For 2009, using the average fair value there were six reporting units whose fair value exceeded their carrying value by less than 10%, and there was $615.3 of goodwill associated with these reporting units. Using the low end of the valuation range, the carrying values for five reporting units exceeded their respective fair values, and there was $341.8 of goodwill associated with these reporting units that would be subject to the second step of a goodwill impairment review. There were three reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%, and there was $715.0 of goodwill associated with these reporting units. Using the high end of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair values. There were five reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%, and there was $430.4 of goodwill associated with these reporting units.  

Pension and Postretirement Benefits  

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. Management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events. 

The discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. At December 31, 2009, we determined our discount rates based on a bond-yield curve approach, which uses discount rate models that apply a consistent methodology to constructing a universe of high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds. Utilizing each countrys bond universe, AA spot rate yield curves are derived, and the plans cash flows are applied to those spot rate yield curves to calculate a discount rate. In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate. Weighted-average discount rates of 5.51%, 5.50% and 5.50% were used in the calculation of 2010 net pension and postretirement benefit costs for the domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and the postretirement plan, respectively. A lower discount rate would increase our net pension and postretirement benefit costs. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2010 net pension and postretirement cost by approximately $2.0 and $1.0, respectively.  

On December 31, 2010 we changed from using a bond-yield curve approach, as described above, to a bond selection/settlement approach for our domestic pension and postretirement plans, as well as for our foreign pension plans located in the United Kingdom. We believe the new approach provides a better estimate of the discount rate because it reflects the approach the company would use if actually acquiring a portfolio of bonds to immunize or effectively settle our obligation. Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of AA-rated corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. For our domestic plans, this change in our discount rate selection process resulted in a decrease in our pension and postretirement obligation of $8.6 and an increase in other comprehensive income of $5.0, net of tax. For our foreign plans, this change resulted in a decrease of $18.3 to our pension obligation and an increase in other comprehensive income of $18.3, net of tax. This change did not impact our pension and postretirement benefit costs for 2010. We do not expect that this change will have a significant impact to our consolidated results of operations in future years.  

At December 31, 2010, we used a discount rate of 5.50% for the domestic pension and postretirement plans and a weighted-average discount rate of 5.45% for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2010 benefit obligation by approximately $20.0 and $21.0, respectively.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.  

Net pension costs included in our 2010 consolidated results of operations were calculated using weighted-average expected rates of return of 7.49% and 5.84% for the domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2011, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 7.50% for the domestic pension plan and a weighted-average rate of return of 5.88% for the foreign pension plans. Changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. A lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2010 net pension cost by approximately $1.0. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Consolidated Results of Operations  

REVENUE  

Our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. Additionally, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects in the events marketing business, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. We generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

During 2010, our revenue increased by $504.3, or 8.4%, compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $424.0, or 7.0%, and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $63.3. Our organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in nearly all sectors of our business and throughout most geographic regions. The sectors which contributed the most to the organic revenue increase were auto and transportation, financial services and health and personal care. The auto and transportation, financial services and technology and telecom sectors were the primary sectors that were negatively impacted by the global recession in 2009. Although our technology and telecom sector experienced a slight organic revenue decrease for the full year 2010, this sector had an organic revenue increase in the second half of 2010 as the impact of certain lost assignments in the prior year diminished. Regionally, the largest organic revenue increase was in our domestic market, primarily related to the factors noted above. Our international organic revenue increase was most notably in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil, in our Other region, which includes South Africa, Canada and the Middle East, and in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and India. The United Kingdom was essentially flat as the organic revenue increase in the second half of the year offset declines in the first half of 2010. This organic revenue increase in the United Kingdom, as well as the increase in Brazil, was partially attributable to growth in the packaged goods sector. There was an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Italy, Germany and Spain, which includes the impact of a continued weakened economic climate in certain European countries.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2009, our revenue decreased by $935.1, or 13.4%, compared to 2008, primarily consisting of an organic revenue decrease of $752.6, or 10.8%, and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $251.6. Our organic decrease was primarily attributable to spending declines and lost assignments as a result of the negative impact of global economic conditions on nearly all sectors of our business throughout all geographic regions. The sectors that primarily contributed to the organic revenue decrease were technology and telecom, auto and transportation and financial services. Two other significant sectors, health and personal care and food and beverage, were relatively stable in 2009 as they only had slight organic revenue decreases. Additionally, a small percentage of our organic revenue decrease was related to prior-year project assignments in our events marketing discipline that, due to economic conditions, did not recur or were substantially curtailed. These projects are reflected in various sectors and geographic regions.  

Refer to the segment discussion later in this MD&A for information on changes in revenue by segment.

Salaries and Related Expenses  

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards. Additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have decreases in operating performance. Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. Factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, the change in our stock price and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related expenses in 2010 increased by $155.8 compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $116.2 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $32.6. Salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased to 63.0% in 2010 from 65.7% in the prior year. The organic increase was due to higher temporary help of $54.8 incurred to support business growth (organic revenue increase of $424.0). We had higher incentive award expense of $67.7 and, to a lesser extent, other discretionary bonus awards, primarily due to improved operating results in 2010. This is in contrast to the prior year, where we had lower incentive award expense due to lower operating performance, primarily as a result of difficult economic conditions. The organic increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily in our domestic market and certain international regions with improved operating results. In locations where we had organic revenue decreases, such as various countries in the Continental Europe region, we had lower salaries and related expenses due to large workforce reductions taken in 2009 as well as additional actions taken in 2010. The increases in salaries and related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in severance expense of $67.6 compared to the prior year.  

Salaries and related expenses in 2009 decreased by $381.4 compared to 2008, primarily consisting of an organic decrease of $279.2 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $150.0. Salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased to 65.7% in 2009 from 62.4% in the prior year. The organic improvement was due to lower base salaries and benefits of $221.5 and lower temporary help of $45.2, primarily related to work force reductions across all networks during 2009 to respond to the difficult economic conditions. Our work force reductions resulted in an organic increase in severance charges of $79.9 in 2009 when compared to the prior year, primarily related to our advertising and media businesses in the Integrated Agency Networks (IAN) segment, predominantly in the U.S. and Continental Europe regions. Due to severance actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 through 2009, we reduced our workforce by approximately 14%. The organic decrease also included a reduction in incentive award expense of $55.9, resulting from lower annual bonus awards due to lower operating results and lower long-term incentive award expense attributable to an increase in our forfeiture rate and changes in our assumptions on achieving certain performance targets. These reductions were partially offset by higher expense due to increases in our stock price in 2009 as compared to 2008.  

The following table details our salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue.

Our staff cost ratio, defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, decreased in 2010 to 63.0% from 65.7% in 2009, primarily driven by higher revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower severance expense, partially offset by an increase in incentive expense and temporary help. Our staff cost ratio increased in 2009 to 65.7% from 62.4% in 2008, primarily driven by lower revenues and increased severance expense, partially offset by lower base salaries, benefits, temporary help and incentive award expense.  

Office and General Expenses  

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff, and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Office and general expenses in 2010 increased by $141.8 compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $115.0 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $20.9. The primary driver for the organic increase was higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2010 as compared to the prior year. The remainder of the organic increase was due to higher discretionary spending to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 related to our Venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of January 1, 2010. The organic increase was partially offset by lower occupancy costs, which was partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009.  

Office and general expenses in 2009 decreased by $292.8 compared to 2008, primarily consisting of an organic decrease of $238.5 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $79.2. The organic improvement was largely due to our cost containment efforts, which resulted in lower discretionary spending. Additionally, approximately one-third of the organic decline was attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that did not recur or decreased in size during 2009. These reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, higher rent charges in 2009 due to lease terminations and other exit costs.  

The following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. All other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses and, to a lesser extent, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, foreign currency gains (losses) and other expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our office and general expense ratio, defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, remained unchanged in 2010 at 28.5% when compared to 2009. During 2010 our office and general expense ratio

 was benefited by higher revenues offset by higher production expenses. Our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2009 to 28.5% from 28.9% in 2008, primarily driven by the major expense categories that had reductions listed above, partially offset by lower revenue.  

Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges, net  

The components of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges, net is listed below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Restructuring charges (reversals), net relate to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at Lowe during the third quarter of 2007. Included in these net charges (reversals) are adjustments primarily resulting from changes in managements estimates relating to sublease rental income assumptions, prior severance and termination related actions and accelerated leasehold amortization.  

Other reorganization-related charges, net were separated from the rest of our operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations because they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business. These charges primarily relate to the integration of our recent acquisition of Delaney Lund Knox Warren (DLKW) into our Lowe London operations in 2010, the alignment of Deutsch and Lowe in 2009 and the realignment of our media businesses into a management entity called Mediabrands in 2008. Charges relate to severance and termination costs and lease termination and other exit costs for these activities. The actions associated with the integration of DLKW, the alignment of Deutsch and Lowe, and the establishment of Mediabrands are complete. As a result of the alignment of DLKW into our Lowe London operations, we believe Lowe is strengthened by the addition of a premier full-service communications agency in its London operations, and DLKW benefits from the multinational reach of Lowe. The combined agencies, called DLKW Lowe, serve as the United Kingdom hub for Lowe and Partners Worldwide.  

EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Interest Expense  

For 2010, net interest expense decreased by $9.6 as compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in non-cash interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The reduction in non-cash interest expense was due to no longer

 amortizing deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs that were associated with our $750.0 Three-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2006 (the 2006 Credit Agreement), which expired in June 2009. Interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower domestic interest rates compared to 2009.  

For 2009, cash interest expense, largely related to our short-term obligations, and interest income both decreased as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates, mostly in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States. The majority of the change in non-cash interest expense resulted from a decline in amortization of deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs in connection with the expiration of our 2006 Credit Agreement. The decrease in non-cash interest expense was partially offset by changes in the value of obligations to purchase noncontrolling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries. The value of these obligations may fluctuate depending on projected future operating performance of these subsidiaries.  

Other Income, net  

Results of operations include certain items which are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  During 2009, we recorded a net charge of $25.1 primarily related to the settlement of our tender offers for our 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 (the 2009 Notes), our 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and our Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010 (the 2010 Notes).  

Sales of Businesses and Investments  This item primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses, cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our Rabbi Trusts. During 2010, we recognized a gain relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our Constituency Management Group (CMG) segment, which was partially offset by a loss recognized relating to the sale of one our European businesses within our IAN segment. During 2009, we realized a gain of $15.2 related to the sale of an investment in our Rabbi Trusts, which was partially offset by losses realized from the sale of various businesses.  

Vendor Discounts and Credit Adjustments  We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established during the 2004 Restatement. These adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed.  

Litigation Settlement  During May 2008, the SEC concluded its investigation that began in 2002 into our financial reporting practices, resulting in a settlement charge of $12.0.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income. In 2010, our effective tax rate of 38.0% was positively impacted by reversals of valuation allowances in Canada and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the taxation of foreign operations, which included an income tax assessment in Latin America.  

In December 2010, we effectively settled with the United Kingdom tax authorities for the 2007 and 2008 tax years. The settlement resulted in no cash payment. In September 2010, we effectively settled our New York State examination for the 1999-2001 tax years. The settlement resulted in a cash payment of $11.7 consisting of $5.4 of tax and $6.3 of interest, which was previously reserved.  

In 2009, our effective tax rate of 38.8% was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, net, which includes the recognition of tax benefits on partially worthless securities of $10.7. Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in the Asia Pacific region and the write-off of deferred tax assets related to restricted stock.  

During 2009, we finalized our proceedings with the IRS appeals division for the 1997-2002 and 2003-2004 audit cycles. We also finalized our IRS examination for the 2005-2006 audit cycle. As a result, we recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $50.1 related to various items of income and expense, including transfer pricing adjustments and adjustments relating to the 2004 Restatement.  

In 2008, our effective tax rate of 33.2% was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances, the non-deductible SEC settlement provision and additional net tax reserves for uncertain tax positions. Our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2008 by the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against taxable profits and by the net reversal of certain valuation allowances in jurisdictions where entities have demonstrated a sustained period of profitability and future projections indicate that the trend will continue. Additionally, we recognized tax benefits from tax law and other changes in certain U.S. states, which impacted the effective tax rate.  

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic earnings per share available to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $0.57 $0.20 and $0.57, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $0.47, $0.19 and $0.52, respectively.  

Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a benefit from the repurchase of a portion of our 5 1/4% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock). We declared dividends of $15.6, $27.6 and $27.6 on our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Segment Results of Operations  

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2010: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the Corporate and other group.

IAN  

REVENUE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2010, IAN revenue increased by $405.5 compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $330.5 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $58.4. The IAN segment represents 84% of consolidated revenues and accounted for 78% of the organic increase in consolidated revenues. The reasons for the organic increase are similar to those described in the consolidated revenue section. The organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in most sectors of our business, primarily in the auto and transportation, financial services and health and personal care sectors, and in nearly all regions, across our advertising and media businesses. The international organic increase was primarily in the Latin America region, mostly in Brazil, and in our Other region, which includes South Africa, Canada and the Middle East. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by organic decreases in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Italy, Germany and Spain, which includes the continued effect of a weakened economic climate in certain European countries.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2009, IAN revenue decreased by $758.2 compared to 2008, primarily consisting of an organic revenue decrease of $610.7 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $216.6. The domestic and international organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by a pullback of existing client spending throughout all agencies within IAN, primarily due to challenging economic conditions and lost assignments from certain existing clients. The international organic decrease occurred throughout all regions, with the largest impacts in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Spain and France, the United Kingdom, and the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and Japan. The decrease was most predominant in the technology and telecom, auto and transportation and financial service sectors.  

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in revenue of $405.5 partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $126.2 and in office and general expenses of $85.9. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to higher temporary help across most of the agencies within IAN to support their business growth, as well as higher incentive award expense attributable to improved operating results in 2010. These increases were partially offset by lower severance expense compared to the prior year. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher discretionary spending and employment costs to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 related to our

 Venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of January 1, 2010. The increase in office and general expenses was partially offset by lower occupancy costs, which were partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009.  

Operating income decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to a decrease in revenue of $758.2 partially offset by decreases in salaries and related expenses of $286.3 and office and general expenses of $207.0. The decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to lower base salaries, benefits and temporary help related to work force reductions in 2009 across all agencies within IAN. Incentive award expense decreased during 2009, primarily due to reduced annual bonus awards consistent with the explanations provided in the consolidated Salaries and Related Expenses section. These reductions were partially offset by higher severance charges resulting from the work force actions taken during 2009, which affected all regions, with the largest impact in the U.S. and Continental Europe. Office and general expenses decreased primarily due to cost containment measures that reduced discretionary spending. These reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009.  

CMG  

REVENUE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2010, CMG revenue increased by $98.8 compared to 2009, primarily due to an organic revenue increase of $93.5. The CMG segment represents 16% of consolidated revenues and accounted for 22% of the organic increase of consolidated revenues. The organic revenue increase was due to net client wins and increases in client spending in all major disciplines, primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses, and predominantly in the domestic market. These increases include the impact of higher revenue related to certain projects where we act as principal, primarily in our events marketing business. The international organic increase occurred primarily in the Asia Pacific region, most notably in China and in our public relations and events marketing businesses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2009, CMG revenue decreased by $176.9 compared to 2008, primarily due to an organic revenue decline of $141.9 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $35.0. The domestic and international organic revenue decreases were primarily due to the completion of several projects with existing clients in 2008 that did not recur or were substantially curtailed in 2009 in our events marketing business and the pullback of existing client spending in certain of our public relations and branding businesses due to broader economic difficulties. The international organic decrease occurred primarily in the United Kingdom and the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and Australia.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in revenue of $98.8, partially offset by increases in office and general expenses of $58.5 and salaries and related expenses of $32.3. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses. Increases in salaries and related expenses were primarily due to higher base salaries, benefits and temporary help in all major disciplines commensurate with regional growth and related increased headcount, as well as an increase in incentive award expense due to improved operating results.  

Operating income decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to a decrease in revenue of $176.9, partially offset by decreases in office and general expenses of $84.2 and salaries and related expenses of $76.7. Office and general expenses decreased primarily due to lower production expenses and, to a lesser extent, reductions in certain discretionary expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009. Salaries and related expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in base salaries, benefits and temporary help as a result of lower headcount from severance actions, as well as a decrease in incentive award expense driven by lower annual bonus awards due to reduced operating results.  

CORPORATE AND OTHER  

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives awards, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services, which are engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition, office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of these expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. Allocation methodologies in 2010 are consistent with prior years.  

Corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during 2010 by $5.3 to $145.3 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower base salaries, benefits and temporary help as a result of work force reductions in 2009, and decreases in various other corporate expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in incentive award expense driven by improved consolidated operating results.  

Corporate and other expenses decreased during 2009 by $20.0 to $150.6 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower long-term incentive award expense and reductions in professional fees. The reduction in long-term incentive award expense primarily related to the vesting in the first quarter of 2009 of a one-time performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives and to changes in our assumptions on achieving certain performance targets. The decline in professional fees is primarily due to reduced audit and legal fees.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW  

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1 Reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation and deferred income taxes.  

 2 Reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was $817.3, which is an improvement of $276.5 as compared to 2009, as a result of an increase in net income of $137.8 as well as an improvement in working capital of $164.3. An important component of net cash provided by operating activities consists of net cash provided by working capital of $263.2. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year, with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters. The increased generation of working capital in 2010 was primarily attributable to business growth, most notably at our media businesses.  

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers.  

Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily reflects payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by net proceeds from the sales of businesses and investments. Capital expenditures of $96.3 relate to  

31  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (continued)  

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

 leasehold improvements, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures. Payments for acquisitions of $61.9 relate to new acquisitions, primarily DLKW, as well as deferred payments on prior acquisitions.  

Net cash provided by investing activities during 2009 includes sales and maturities of short-term marketable securities, partially offset by deferred payments on prior acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net sales and maturities of short-term marketable securities of $158.5 primarily relates to the redemption of a time deposit.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash used in financing activities during 2010 includes the repurchase of a portion of our Series B Preferred Stock for $265.9 in cash, payments of long-term debt of $217.3, primarily as a result of the maturity of our 2010 Notes, distributions to noncontrolling interests of $21.5 and dividend payments of $19.6 on our Series B Preferred Stock. Additionally, we paid $22.8 for a capped call transaction related to our 4.75% Notes. See Financing and Sources of Funds below for further information.  

Net cash used in financing activities during 2009 primarily reflects proceeds, uses and fees related to our debt transactions. We issued $600.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 10.00% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017. We settled the tender offers of our 2009 Notes, 2011 Notes and 2010 Notes with a cash payment of $734.7. Additionally, we paid $36.0 in cash to redeem the remaining 2009 Notes, we paid $8.0 in cash to retire the remaining 4.50% Notes and we made certain other cash payments relating to long-term debt. Amounts related to accrued and unpaid interest for these transactions are reflected in Operating Activities. Cash used related to these debt transactions and other debt repayments, including issuance costs and discounts, was $214.9, net of cash proceeds from the new issuance.  

Foreign Exchange Rate Changes  

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in an increase of $19.4 during 2010. This increase primarily reflects the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against several foreign currencies, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro during this period.  

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in an increase of $84.8 during 2009. This increase primarily reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Euro during this period.  

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  

We expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We also have a committed corporate credit facility available to support our operating needs. While we believe the economic climate has improved in many of our key markets, we believe macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain and if conditions deteriorated it could challenge our level of cash generation from operations. We continue to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures and cash used for new acquisitions. We are maintaining our cost discipline as we continue to position ourselves for growth.  

From time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Funding Requirements  

Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, common share repurchases, dividends, taxes, debt service and contributions to pension and postretirement plans. Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options arising from prior acquisitions to sell us their interests. Notable funding requirements include:  

       Acquisitions  We paid cash of $47.1 for acquisitions completed in 2010. In relation to acquisitions completed in previous years, we paid $20.9 of deferred payments as well as $24.7 of payments related to transactions with consolidated subsidiaries where we increased our ownership interests in 2010. We expect to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and to increase our ownership interests in current investments, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets. In addition to cash expenditures for new acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately $62.7 in 2011 related to acquisitions we completed in 2010 and in previous years. We may also be required to pay approximately $46.8 related to put options that are exercisable over the next twelve months.  

       Common share repurchase program  On February 24, 2011 our Board of Directors (Board) authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0 of our common stock. We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases under the authorization will depend on market conditions and our other funding requirements. The share repurchase program has no expiration date.  

       Dividends  On February 24, 2011 our Board declared a dividend of $0.06 per share on our common shares, payable on March 25, 2011 to holders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2011, and we intend to resume quarterly common stock dividend payments thereafter. As of February 16, 2011, we had 489.2 shares outstanding, which would correspond to an aggregate March 2011 dividend payment of approximately $29.4. We also pay regular quarterly dividends of $2.9, or $11.6 annually, on our Series B Preferred Stock.  

       Debt service  During 2010 we paid $213.7 in cash as our 2010 Notes matured. Our $36.3 aggregate principal amount of 2011 Notes outstanding mature on August 15, 2011 and we expect to use available cash to retire the outstanding notes. The remainder of our debt is primarily long-term, with maturities through 2023. See the table below for the maturity schedule of our long-term debt.  

       Contributions to pension plans  Our funding policy regarding our pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus such additional amounts as we consider appropriate to improve the plans funded status. During 2010, we contributed $9.6 and $28.1 to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2011, we expect to contribute $12.1 and $22.8 to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively.  

The following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1 Amounts represent maturity at par. Holders of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 may require us to repurchase their notes for cash at par in March 2012 and holders of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 may require us to repurchase their notes for cash, stock or a combination, at our election, at par in March 2013. All of these notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.  

 2 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements.  

 3 We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations based on the future performance of the acquired entity. See Note 5 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS  

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries. Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1 We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. These letters of credit have historically not been drawn upon.  

 2 We also maintain uncommitted credit facilities with various banks throughout the world. As of December 31, 2010, our aggregate borrowing capacity under these uncommitted facilities was $455.2. At that date $114.8 in borrowings under these facilities was outstanding and letters of credit in the amount of $0.1 were issued.  

Credit Facilities  

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility. In April 2010, we amended and restated our credit agreement originally dated as of July 18, 2008 (as amended and restated as of April 23, 2010, the Credit Agreement). The amendments increased commitments of the lenders to $650.0 from $335.0, added five new lenders and extended the Credit Agreements expiration to July 18, 2013. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $650.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a limit on letters of credit of $200.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. We have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003, although we use them for letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries.  

The Credit Agreement includes covenants that, among other things, limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limit subsidiary debt. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants, that subject to certain exceptions, restrict us from making cash acquisitions, making capital expenditures, repurchasing our common stock and declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock, in excess of an aggregate basket of $600.0 in any fiscal year, of which we may carry forward unused amounts of up to $200.0 to the next fiscal year, provided that (a) if we have a leverage ratio of greater than 2.75 to 1 at the end of any fiscal year, we may not carry forward unused amounts, and cash common stock dividends and net share repurchases not otherwise permitted will be restricted to $400.0 for the next fiscal year, and (b) if we have a leverage ratio of 2.75 to 1 or less at the end of any fiscal year, in the next fiscal year the aggregate basket will be $800.0 and cash common stock dividends and net share repurchases not otherwise permitted may not exceed $600.0. In addition, the aggregate basket in any fiscal year, but not the amount for cash common stock dividends and net share repurchases, may be increased, subject to certain limitations, by up to $100.0 of net cash proceeds from dispositions made during such fiscal year.  

We were in compliance with all applicable restrictive and financial covenants in the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2010. The table below sets forth the financial covenants applicable as of December 31, 2010.

If we were unable to comply with these financial covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. If we do not comply with these financial covenants and were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the Credit Agreement could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement.  

In December 2009, we entered into a letter of credit agreement (the 2009 LC Agreement) to provide for the issuance of standby letters of credit denominated in Pound Sterling. The face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the 2009 LC Agreement is subject to an aggregate limit at any one time of £45.0 (equivalent as of December 31, 2010 to $69.2). In January 2010, we transferred letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement to this facility to provide additional liquidity under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2010 we did not have any letters of credit outstanding under the 2009 LC Agreement. We terminated the 2009 LC Agreement as of December 31, 2010 as we were no longer required to issue letters of credit associated with various projects in the United Kingdom.  

We also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the United States, and the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $114.8 and $93.4, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately 5.0% and 4.0%, respectively.  

Capped Call  

We purchased capped call options in November 2010 to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the 16.1 shares of our common stock into which our 4.75% Notes are convertible. The options give us the right to purchase up to 16.1 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $12.42 per share (subject to adjustments upon certain events with respect to us or our common stock), except that the economic value of the net proceeds of exercising the options will not exceed the difference between the strike price and a cap price of $18.26 per share. Subject to certain limitations, we may elect settlement of the options to occur in cash or in shares. The options will expire on April 2, 2013. Our capped call transaction meets the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement per Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).  

Investments  

From time to time, we make investments in privately held companies that we believe may be of interest to the advertising and marketing sectors. These investments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost. Certain of these investments, the most significant of which is Facebook, have significantly appreciated compared to their cost, but there can be no assurance as to the terms on which we would be able to dispose of any such investments.  

Cash Pooling  

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the amounts netted were $916.1 and $946.5, respectively.

DEBT RATINGS  

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 16, 2011 are listed below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The most recent changes in our credit ratings occurred in November 2010 when Standard and Poors changed our outlook from stable to positive. Additionally, in October 2010 Fitch Ratings upgraded our rating from BB+ to BBB, which is an investment grade rating, and changed our outlook from positive to stable. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, including, among other things, because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise. For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid.  

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2010 and certain accounting standards that we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our future operations.
