CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  

OPERATIONS (MD&A)  

WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS MD&A  

Our MD&A includes the following major sections:  

     real estate investment trust (REIT) conversion;  

     economic and market conditions affecting our operations;  

     financial performance summary;  

     results of our operations  consolidated and by segment;  

     liquidity and capital resources  where we discuss our cash flows;  

     off-balance sheet arrangements;  

     environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and  

     accounting matters  where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.  

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) CONVERSION  

Our board of directors has determined that conversion to a REIT best supports our strategic direction. For tax purposes, this change was effective January 1, 2010.  

We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sale contracts. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. A significant portion of our timberland segment earnings will receive this favorable tax treatment. We will, however, be subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We also will continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRS, which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and our non-qualified timberland segment income. Following are points related to our conversion:  

     We received shareholder approval on April 15, 2010 to issue a significant number of shares to enable the payout of earnings and profits to shareholders. On July 13, 2010, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC covering the issuance of the additional shares of stock. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 2: Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Conversion for more information.  

     To implement our decision to be taxed as a REIT, we distributed to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits, determined under federal income tax provisions, as a Special Dividend. The Special Dividend of $5.6 billion was paid September 1, 2010, and included the regular quarterly dividend of approximately $11 million. At the election of each shareholder, the Special Dividend was paid in cash or Weyerhaeuser common shares. The aggregate amount of cash distributed was $560 million and the number of common shares issued was approximately 324 million.  

     The stock portion of the Special Dividend is treated as the issuance of new shares for accounting purposes and affects our earnings (loss) per share only for periods after the distribution. Prior periods are not restated. The required treatment results in earnings (loss) per share that is less than would have been the case had the common shares not been issued.  

     We reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities, which resulted in a benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010 of approximately $1,064 million. Our 2010 effective income tax rate also decreased due to lower taxes on REIT qualifying timberlands income.  

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS  

The U.S. economy has gradually begun its recovery from the most severe recession since the 1930s. However, the housing market continues to lag other sectors in the recovery and remains burdened by excess inventory and a diminished pool of qualified homebuyers. The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects our Real Estate, Wood Products and Timberlands segments. Real Estate focuses on building single family homes. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for logs from our Timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products. Cellulose Fibers is primarily affected by global demand and the value of the U.S. dollar.  

HOUSING MARKET  

We track certain indicators such as employment, consumer confidence, housing starts, home sales, foreclosures, home prices, mortgage interest rates and the number of homes for sale to assess housing market conditions.  

Throughout 2010 the unemployment rate has remained well above 9 percent but as of December had fallen to 9.4 percent, the lowest level for the year. Weak employment growth contributed to weak consumer confidence, limiting any growth in demand for housing and wood products. Total U.S. housing starts for 2010 were 586 thousand units with single family  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2010 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      33   

Table of Contents 

 units accounting for 472 thousand of the total. This represents a modest 6 percent gain in total starts over 2009, but remains well below the 1992 through 2007 annual levels of over 1 million single family starts. The number of mortgages in default remains very large and the number of foreclosures is expected to remain high relative to historic trends. This will continue to contribute to the inventory of existing homes which limits demand for new homes. New home sales in the U.S. totaled 321 thousand units in 2010. This low level of new home sales last occurred in 1963 and is a decrease of 14 percent from 2009, the previous record low. At the peak in 2005, new home sales were 1.28 million.  

Demand for wood products continued to be affected by the depressed level of new home construction in 2010. Overall demand levels for lumber increased 4 percent from 2009 while demand for oriented strand board (OSB), which is more heavily dependent on residential construction, declined 3 percent from 2009 levels. Demand for both lumber and OSB remain 36 percent to 38 percent below peak levels. As a result, industry operating rates for lumber and OSB averaged between 70 and 80 percent of capacity. Product prices were subject to significant fluctuations in 2010 as a result of low inventories and relatively weak demand. Most prices peaked in the second quarter coinciding with the strongest quarter of construction, only to decrease to levels closer to their costs of production for much of the year. Demand for logs increased as lumber production increased slightly. In the western region, weak domestic demand for logs was offset somewhat by demand from Japan, China and Korea, resulting in increases for western log prices.  

U.S. DOLLAR/GLOBAL DEMAND  

The U.S. dollar has weakened relative to most developed world currencies over 2010. Cellulose Fibers benefitted from the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, as our pulp mills became more competitive compared to European, Canadian and South American producers.  

The combination of the weaker dollar, steady global demand and decreased capacity resulted in a 41 percent increase in the key indicator northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp price in 2010 over 2009. Pulp prices started the year above 2009 levels and increased further as global supplies were strained by production interruptions in Chile, due to earthquakes. The combination of re-started Chilean mills and the production response to higher prices led to a gradual retreat in the key NBSK indicator price in fourth quarter.  

The weaker dollar compared to the Yen resulted in U.S. logs being cheaper. Total housing starts in Japan increased 2 percent from 2009 levels; however, wooden housing starts, a key factor influencing demand for export logs, increased almost 8 percent on a year over year basis. The export log market was affected by increased demand from China. Chinese imports of softwood logs from the U.S. are estimated at 2.4 million cubic meters for 2010, an increase of 400 percent from 2009.  

WHERE WE ARE HEADED  

The U.S. economy has continued to grow through fourth quarter 2010 and into 2011, but there has been no meaningful job growth in the first quarter of 2011. Single-family starts are expected to be higher in the first quarter, as a result of the record low inventory of new homes for sale. Demand for wood products is expected to increase seasonally, however some of this is expected to result from the rebuilding of inventories by dealers and wholesalers. Sustainable demand growth is expected to be modest in 2011. Log prices are expected to rise as a result of the increased seasonal domestic demand for wood products and increasing off-shore demand. The U.S. dollar is expected to remain weak by comparison to the Euro and the Canadian dollar, which will increase the competitive position of U.S. market pulp producers.

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Timberlands  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2010 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      37   

Table of Contents 

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009  

In 2010:  

     Net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers increased $160 million  22 percent.  

     Intersegment sales increased $66 million  12 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $56 million  17 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  Unaffiliated Customers  

The $160 million increase in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted primarily from the following:  

     Western log sales increased $85 million due to increased price realizations of 26 percent.  

     Land exchanges, dispositions of non-strategic timberlands and sales of higher and better-use lands increased $54 million.  

     Sales from our International operations increased $21 million due to improvement in prices across most products and increased sales volumes.  

Intersegment Sales  

The $66 million increase in intersegment sales resulted primarily from the following:  

     $49 million increase due to increased Canadian log and chip sales volumes and  

     $17 million increase due to increase in U.S. log prices.  

Net contribution to earnings  

The $56 million decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted primarily from the following:  

     $163 million pre-tax gain on the third quarter 2009 sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon;  

     $24 million decrease due to decreased harvest levels of 9 percent in the South and 12 percent in the West;  

     $30 million decrease resulting from increased incentive compensation and increased allocations of corporate costs to the business segments; and  

     $17 million increase in operating costs, which includes higher road maintenance, and increased fuel costs.  

These items were partially offset by:  

     $125 million increase primarily due to higher domestic and export prices;  

     $27 million increase due to land exchanges, dispositions of non-strategic timberlands and sales of higher and better-use lands; and  

     $25 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net log sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers decreased $178 million  27 percent.  

     Sales of other products to unaffiliated customers decreased $7 million  3 percent.  

     Intersegment sales decreased $497 million  48 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $46 million  12 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  Unaffiliated Customers  

The $185 million decrease in net sales and revenues to unaffiliated customers resulted from:  

     $218 million decrease  40 percent  in log sales in the West as sales volumes decreased 36 percent and price realizations decreased 6 percent due to weaker domestic and export markets;  

     $7 million decrease  35 percent  in log sales in Canada as sales volume in Canada decreased 23 percent and price realizations decreased 15 percent primarily due to weaker demand; and  

     $7 million decrease  3 percent  in other sales and revenues from unaffiliated customers primarily due to lower timberlands exchange revenues.  

These decreases were partially offset by $47 million  48 percent  increase in log sales in the South as sales volumes increased 51 percent, primarily due to sales of fiber logs to International Paper for use at locations that previously were owned by Weyerhaeuser and higher grade log sales to domestic customers.  

Intersegment Sales  

The $497 million decrease in intersegment sales primarily resulted from:  

     fewer Weyerhaeuser mills in operation as a result of closures and curtailments of Wood Products operations in the United States; and  

     sales to Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling operations became third-party sales after we sold the business to International Paper in August 2008.  

Net contribution to earnings  

The $46 million decrease in net contribution to earnings primarily resulted from:  

     $146 million due to a 40 percent reduction in harvest in the West and 27 percent reduction in harvest in the South;  

     $113 million due to lower domestic and export prices in the West and South; and  

     $15 million due to asset impairments.  

 38     

Table of Contents 

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $163 million pretax gain on a sale of 140,000 acres of non-strategic timberland in northwestern Oregon in third quarter 2009;  

     $44 million reduction of operating costs, including lower salvage logging costs, lower fuel costs and reduced spending on silviculture; and  

     $21 million reduction in selling, general and administrative costs as a result of cost cutting measures.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

Excluding the disposition of non-strategic timberlands, we expect higher earnings in first quarter compared with the fourth. The company expects higher selling prices for western logs and seasonally higher harvest volumes. A sale of approximately 82,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands in southwest Washington that occurred subsequent to year end, will contribute approximately $150 million in pre-tax earnings.  

WOOD PRODUCTS  

HOW WE DID IN 2010  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Wood Products business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Wood Products.   

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009  

In 2010:  

     Restructuring, closures and impairments decreased $63 million  36 percent.  

     Net sales and revenues increased $357 million  16 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings improved $423 million  58 percent.  

 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2010 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      39   

Table of Contents 

Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments  

During fourth quarter 2010, we recognized $92 million of impairment charges in the Wood Products segment primarily related to the decision to permanently close three Wood Products facilities that were previously indefinitely closed. These include an engineered wood products facility in Deerwood, Minnesota, a sawmill in Pine Hill, Alabama and an oriented strand board mill in Wawa, Ontario. Total restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges in 2010 for the segment were $114 million. This compares with total Wood Products restructuring, closures and asset impairment charges of $177 million in 2009.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $357 million increase in net sales and revenues was primarily due to the following:  

     Structural lumber average price realizations increased 22 percent.  

     OSB average price realizations increased 27 percent and shipment volumes increased 12 percent.  

     Softwood plywood average price realizations increased 8 percent and shipment volumes increased 17 percent.  

     Hardwood lumber shipment volumes increased 8 percent.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $423 million improvement in net contribution to earnings was primarily due to the following:  

     $276 million increase due to sales price realizations, primarily OSB and structural lumber;  

     $63 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairment;  

     $59 million decrease in manufacturing and other costs of sales as a result of increased operating efficiencies and cost reductions;  

     $52 million increase in the net pretax gain on the sale of assets and operations, including the sale of certain British Columbia forest licenses and associated rights;  

     $35 million decrease in selling and administrative costs, primarily due to staff reductions in 2009; and  

     $13 million decrease in litigation charges, primarily due to the settlement of Alder litigation in 2009.  

These improvements were partially offset by a $64 million increase in log costs.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $1.5 billion  41 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $814 million.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased $1.5 billion primarily due to the following:  

     Structural lumber average price realizations remained flat and shipment volumes decreased 29 percent.  

     Engineered solid section average price realizations decreased 3 percent and shipment volumes decreased 41 percent.  

     Engineered I-joists average price realizations decreased 7 percent and shipment volumes decreased 39 percent.  

     Oriented strand board (OSB) average price realizations decreased 4 percent and shipment volumes decreased 41 percent.  

     Softwood plywood average price realizations decreased 17 percent and shipment volumes decreased 53 percent.  

     Hardwood lumber average price realizations decreased 9 percent and shipment volumes decreased 22 percent.  

     Sales of other products purchased for resale decreased 46 percent as a result of the sale of Canadian and selected U.S. distribution centers and overall decline in demand for building products.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings improved $814 million primarily due to the following:  

     $714 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closures and asset impairments, primarily related to a decrease in impairments of goodwill and other assets;  

     $137 million decrease in raw materials, mainly due to decreased log costs;  

     $107 million decrease in selling and administrative charges resulting from staff reductions and continued focus on reducing costs;  

     $57 million decrease in manufacturing and other cost of sales due to mill optimizations and production efficiencies; and  

     $38 million decrease in warehousing and delivery costs as a result of lower shipment volumes and closures of distribution center facilities.  

These improvements were partially offset by the following:  

     $206 million decrease due to lower sales price realizations and  

     $25 million decrease in contributions from other products purchased for resale as a result of reduced market demand and closed distribution facilities.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

Excluding the effect of fourth quarter special items, Weyerhaeuser anticipates a smaller loss from the segment in first quarter due to improved operating rates, higher selling prices, and continued cost reductions.

CELLULOSE FIBERS  

HOW WE DID IN 2010  

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Cellulose Fibers business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Cellulose Fibers.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Cellulose Fibers  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009  

In 2010:  

     Net sales and revenues increased $400 million  26 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $32 million  7 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues increased $400 million primarily due to the following:  

     Pulp price realizations increased $192 per ton  28 percent  primarily due to tight global softwood pulp inventories, due in part to lower industry production in the first half of 2010 as a result of the Chilean earthquake that occurred in February 2010.  

     Sales volumes for pulp increased 17,000 tons  1 percent.  

     Liquid packaging board price realizations increased $80 per ton  8 percent  primarily due to a favorable mix shift toward coated board.  

     Sales volumes for liquid packaging board increased approximately 23,000 tons  8 percent.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings decreased $32 million primarily due to the following:  

     $344 million decrease due to alternative fuel mixture credits, see Liquidity and Capital Resources  Other Liquidity Related Disclosures for more information related to the alternative fuel mixture credits;  

     $69 million increase in operating costs, freight and the effect on Canadian operating costs of the weakening U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar; and  

     $11 million increase in general and administrative cost.  

Partially offsetting these decreases in earnings were the following increases:  

     $330 million increase due to higher pulp price realizations,  

     $24 million increase in other product realizations,  

     $25 million increase due to higher liquid packaging board price realizations and  

     $12 million in other non operating income.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $254 million  14 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $297 million  202 percent.

Table of Contents 

Net Sales and Revenues  

The effects of the global economic recession  weaker pulp demand and a stronger U.S. dollar  resulted in decreased sales realizations from fourth quarter 2008 through first half 2009. Pulp prices improved in the second half as the U.S. dollar weakened and demand strengthened. The $254 million decrease in net sales and revenues for the full year 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the following:  

     Pulp price realizations decreased $120 per ton  15 percent;  

     Sales volume of pulp decreased approximately 7,000 tons;  

     Sales volume of liquid packaging board decreased approximately 14,000 tons  5 percent; and  

     Sales price of liquid packaging increased $46 per ton  5 percent.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings increased $297 million primarily due to the following:  

     $344 million increase due to alternative fuel mixture credits, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information related to alternative fuel mixture credits;  

     $94 million goodwill impairment charge in fourth quarter 2008, which did not recur in 2009;  

     $80 million decrease in fiber, freight and energy costs, primarily related to lower prices for chips and fuel;  

     $46 million decrease in other operating and maintenance costs, primarily as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. exchange rate on Canadian operating costs year over year;  

     $13 million increase in liquid packaging board price realizations; and  

     $12 million decrease in administrative costs as a result of cost reduction activities.  

These increases were partially offset by the following decreases:  

     $203 million due to lower pulp prices and lower pulp sales volumes, as global market demand decreased from the prior year;  

     $40 million as a result of lower production, primarily due to maintenance downtime and market downtime in the first half of the year;  

     $26 million due to lower other product realizations; and  

     $23 million in other non operating income and earnings from our interest in our newsprint joint venture due to lower newsprint market prices.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

We expect Cellulose Fibers earnings to decline in first quarter due to an increase in the number scheduled annual maintenance outages.

We report single-family unit statistics for our Real Estate business segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate.   

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Real Estate  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009  

In 2010:  

     Net sales and revenues increased $19 million  2 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $390 million.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $19 million increase in net sales and revenues resulted primarily from:  

     $10 million increase in single-family housing revenues primarily due to a shift in product mix; and  

       The average price of homes closed improved to $396,000 in 2010 from $382,000 in 2009.  

       This was partially offset by a 2 percent decline in home closings  2010 included closings of 2,125 compared to 2,177 in 2009.  

     $9 million net increase in land and other revenues primarily related to the sale of an apartment building in 2010.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $390 million increase in net contribution to earnings resulted primarily from:  

     $240 million decrease in impairments and other related charges;  

 42     

Table of Contents 

     $56 million increase  37 percent  in contribution from single-family closings. The net contribution reflects a $60 million benefit as a result of improved margins due to the mix of homes closed, partially offset by a $4 million decrease as a result of fewer closings;  

     $24 million decrease in restructuring and other related charges;  

     $24 million increase in contributions from sales of partnership interests  2010 included gains of $33 million on sales compared to $9 million in 2009;  

     $23 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales;  

     $19 million decrease in selling and general and administrative expenses due to cost cutting measures, including reductions in headcount; and  

     $4 million increase in contributions from partnership income  2010 included income of $12 million compared to $8 million in 2009.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $504 million  36 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings increased $1.1 billion  78 percent.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $504 million decrease in net sales and revenues resulted from:  

     Single-family revenues decreased $462 million  36 percent. This included:  

       $410 million due to a 32 percent decrease in single-family home closings and  

       $52 million due to a 6 percent decrease in the average sales price of homes closed.  

     Land and lot sales decreased $31 million  31 percent.  

     Other revenue decreased $11 million.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.1 billion increase in net contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $815 million decrease in impairments and write-offs of preacquisition and abandoned community costs;  

     $233 million increase in contribution from land and lot sales;  

     $73 million benefit from lower selling, general and administrative costs, primarily due to lower sales volumes, a reduction in the number of open communities, and general cost cutting measures, including a reduction in headcount.  

Offsetting the increase was:  

     $56 million decrease in single-family gross margin, primarily the result of fewer closings at lower prices; and  

     $17 million increase in restructuring charges, primarily related to vacated office space and headcount reductions.  

OUR OUTLOOK  

We expect a small loss from single-family homebuilding operations in first quarter due to fewer home sale closings and lower margins.

CORPORATE AND OTHER  

We report what our Corporate and Other segment includes in Our Business/What We Do/Corporate and Other.  

Here is a comparison of net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for the last three years:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contributions to Earnings for Corporate and Other  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

HOW WE DID IN 2010  

The segments results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates primarily related to our Canadian operations, changes in our stock price, pension and postretirement credits (costs), and strategic initiatives outside the operating segments. Results for the Corporate and Other segment also include the net gain on divestitures that affect multiple business segments and the disposition of entire business segments.  

We completed the sale of our five short line railroads in December 2010  

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009  

In 2010:  

     Net sales and revenues increased $88 million  53 percent.  

     Net contributions to earnings increased $178 million.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

The $88 million increase in net sales and revenues primarily consisted of increased revenues generated by our Westwood Shipping operations as a result of higher volumes and prices.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

Net contribution to earnings increased $178 million, primarily resulting from the following:  

     $183 million decrease in charges for asset impairments and corporate restructuring activities;  

     $46 million increase for the gain on the sale of our five short line railroads; and  

     $32 million increase in earnings from transportation operations, primarily from our Westwood Shipping operations.  

These increases were partially offset by the following:  

     $29 million decrease related to litigation and insurance reimbursements received in 2009;  

     $28 million decrease in foreign exchange, primarily resulting from a smaller change in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 as compared to 2009; and  

     $18 million decrease related to the 2009 sale of a Honolulu box plant site.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

In 2009:  

     Net sales and revenues decreased $227 million  58 percent.  

     Net contribution to earnings decreased $1.7 billion.  

Net Sales and Revenues  

Net sales and revenues decreased, primarily due to the sale of our Australian operations in July 2008 and decreased revenue in our transportation business during 2009.  

Net Contribution to Earnings  

The $1.7 billion decrease in net contribution to earnings resulted from:  

     $1.2 billion pretax gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business;  

     $250 million pretax non-cash gain recognized in 2008 from restructuring our joint ventures in Uruguay in 2008;  

     $218 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of our Australian operations;  

     $64 million reduction in net pension and postretirement credits primarily related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities partially offset by changes in plan participation;  

     $55 million decrease in earnings from Westwood Shipping operations, as well as international operations that were disposed of in 2008;  

     $52 million pretax gain recognized in 2008 from changes in our U.S. postretirement plans for salaried employees in the U.S; and  

     $51 million increase in charges for asset impairments and restructuring activities, primarily related to 2009 pension settlements and curtailments.  

These decreases were partially offset by the following:  

     $82 million change in net foreign exchange gains and losses  $39 million gain in 2009 compared to $43 million loss in 2008  primarily resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar;  

     $59 million decrease in general and administrative costs as a result of implementing company cost saving initiatives; and  

     $51 million decrease in Weyerhaeusers expense related to previously capitalized interest on excess qualifying assets of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company, primarily due to lower home and land sales in 2009.

CONTAINERBOARD, PACKAGING AND RECYCLING  

On August 4, 2008, our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business was sold to International Paper. As a result, the year ended December 31, 2008, includes 31 weeks of operations. Subsequent to third quarter 2008, we no longer have results of operations for the Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling segment.  

Here are net sales and revenues and net contribution to earnings for 2008:  

Net Sales and Revenues and Net Contribution to Earnings for Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

INTEREST EXPENSE  

Including interest expense reported in discontinued operations, our net interest expense incurred for the last three years was:  

     $452 million in 2010,  

     $462 million in 2009 and  

     $414 million in 2008.  

In connection with the repayments, included in our net interest expense, we recognized the following pretax (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt:  

     $50 million in 2010,  

     $28 million in 2009 and  

     $(32) million in 2008.  

Reductions in our amount of outstanding debt was:  

     $627 million in 2010,  

     $327 million in 2009 and  

     $1.4 billion in 2008.  

INCOME TAXES  

Our benefit for income taxes for our continuing operations over the last three years was:  

     $1,187 million in 2010,  

     $274 million in 2009 and  

     $900 million in 2008.  

During 2010, we recorded the following tax benefits or charges:  

     We reversed certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of our conversion to a REIT, which resulted in a benefit of $1,064 million. See Note 2: Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Conversion.  

     We recorded a tax benefit of $149 million for cellulosic biofuel producer credits; see Fuel Credits for more information.  

     We recorded a $32 million tax charge as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act and a change in our postretirement medical plan.  

During 2008, we recorded a tax benefit of $57 million as a result of Timber provisions in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (TREE Act) of 2008 enacted May 22, 2008. The provision was effective for one year and reduced the capital gains tax rate on qualified timber sales from 35 percent to 15 percent.  

In addition, income tax expense recorded in connection with divestitures is included in discontinued operations and includes the tax expense on dispositions of $887 million related to the gain on sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business and $58 million related to the gain on sale of our Australian operations in 2008. 

As a REIT, we will no longer be required to pay corporate level tax on income of the REIT that is distributed to shareholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2010) on sales of real property (other than standing timber) held by the REIT during the first 10 years following the REIT conversion. We will also continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRS, which principally includes our manufacturing businesses, our real estate development business and the portion of our timberlands segment income included in the TRS.  

The table below summarizes the historical tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:  

     protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and  

     have access at all times to major financial markets.  

CASH FROM OPERATIONS  

Cash from operations includes:  

     cash received from customers;  

     cash paid to employees, suppliers and others;  

     cash paid for interest on our debt; and  

     cash paid or received for taxes.  

Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) our operations was:  

     $744 in 2010,  

     $(162) million in 2009 and  

     $(1.3) billion in 2008.  

COMPARING 2010 WITH 2009  

Net cash provided by operations increased $906 million in 2010 as compared with 2009:  

     Cash we received from customers increased approximately $864 million primarily due to increased price realizations and shipment volumes from our Wood Products, Cellulose Fibers and Timberlands segments.  

     Consolidated cash received for income taxes increased $495 million as compared to 2009.  

Partially offsetting these increases was an increase of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others of approximately $234 million and pension contributions of $233 million in 2010.  

COMPARING 2009 WITH 2008  

Net cash used in operations decreased $1.1 billion in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to the following:  

     Consolidated cash paid for income taxes decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of our Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling business in 2008.  

     Cash we received from customers increased $559 million net of cash paid to employees, suppliers and others. This increase was primarily due to:  

       Cash from operations declined as a result of significantly lower demand for building materials due to the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market.  

       2008 cash from operations includes 31 weeks of Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling and approximately 30 weeks of Australian operations prior to their sales.  

     We received $213 million from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009.  

Fuel Credits  

During 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed a $0.50 per gallon tax credit for the alternative fuel component of alternative fuel mixtures produced and used as a fuel in a taxpayers trade or business. Our application for registration as a blender based on our use of black liquor as an alternative fuel was approved in May 2009. We began blending black liquor (a byproduct of our wood pulping process) and diesel fuel during the first week of April 2009 and blended and used approximately 688 million gallons of the alternative fuel mixture through December 31, 2009, resulting in $344 million of credits. The alternative fuel mixture credit expired on December 31, 2009.  

In an IRS memo dated June 28, 2010, the IRS concluded that black liquor sold or used in 2009 qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit. With the recognition that black liquor potentially qualifies for either the cellulosic biofuel producer credit or the alternative fuel mixture credit (but not both on the same gallon of black liquor), the IRS has provided instructions that would allow a taxpayer to refund alternative fuel mixture credits already received and claim the higher cellulosic biofuel producer credit. We received our registration as a cellulosic biofuel producer in third quarter 2010. In an IRS memo dated October 5, 2010, the IRS concluded that both the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit could be claimed by a taxpayer in the same year. During 2009, we produced approximately 238 million gallons of black liquor, which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit. This equals $240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel producer credit at $1.01 per gallon, or $149 million net of tax, which we recognized in fourth quarter 2010. Since this credit offsets our income tax liability, we will carry the credit forward.

     had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and  

     were in compliance with the credit facility covenants.  

We had no borrowings at any time under our available credit facilities during 2010 or 2009. Our net pay-down under our available credit facilities was $452 million during 2008.

PAYING DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASING STOCK  

We paid dividends of:  

     $608 million in 2010,  

     $127 million in 2009 and  

     $507 million in 2008.  

The increase in dividends paid during 2010 is due to the Special Dividend paid on September 1, 2010, as part of our conversion to a REIT.  

Changes in the amount of dividends we paid during 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to the decrease in our quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 25 cents in December 2008 and to 5 cents in July 2009.  

Our board considered several factors in regards to an appropriate dividend level following REIT conversion. Considerations included the macroeconomic climate, our earnings potential, affordability, our target capital structure, funding for potential growth opportunities and comparability to other timber REIT dividend practices. During December 2010, we provided updated guidance on our dividend level for 2011 by announcing that we expect to pay quarterly dividends of 15 cents per share or 60 cents per share on an annualized basis. On February 10, 2011, our board declared a dividend of 15 cents per share, payable on March 15, 2011.  

In December of 2008, the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $250 million of the companys outstanding shares. During 2009, we repurchased 66,691 shares of common stock at a cost of $2 million under the stock-repurchase program. We have not repurchased any more common shares since 2009.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. They also have a high degree of complexity.  

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:  

     historical experience and  

     assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.  

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.  

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our:  

     pension and postretirement benefit plans;  

     potential impairments of long-lived assets;  

     legal, environmental and product liability reserves; and  

     depletion accounting.  

Details about our other significant accounting policies  what we use and how we estimate  are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:  

     discount rate,  

     expected long-term rate of return,  

     anticipated trends in health care costs,  

     assumed increases in salaries and  

     mortality rates.  

At the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. Actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

Other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:  

     actual pension fund performance,  

     level of lump sum distributions,  

     plan changes,  

     changes in plan participation or coverage and  

     portfolio changes and restructuring.  

This section provides more information about our:  

     expected long-term rate of return,  

     discount rate and  

     cash contributions.  

Expected Long-Term Rate of Returns  

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. After considering all available information at the end of 2010, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.5 percent. Factors we considered include:  

     the 15.3 percent net compounded annual return achieved by our U.S. pension trust investment strategy over the past 26 years and  

     current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.  

Our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net income or expense we recognize for our plans. Every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:  

     $19 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and  

     $3 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.  

Likewise, every 0.5 percent increase in our expected long-term rate of return would decrease expense or increase a credit by those same amounts.  

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.  

Discount Rate  

Our discount rate as of December 31, 2010, is:  

     5.4 percent for our U.S. pensions plans  compared with 5.9 percent at December 31, 2009;  

     5.0 percent for our U.S. postretirement plans  compared with 5.2 percent at December 31, 2009;  

     5.3 percent for our Canadian pension plans  compared with 6.1 percent at December 31, 2009; and  

     5.2 percent for our Canadian postretirement plans  compared with 6.0 percent at December 31, 2009.  

We review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. The discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.  

Pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2011 will be based on the 5.4 percent and 5.0 percent assumed discount rates for U.S. plans and the 5.3 percent and 5.2 percent assumed discount rates for the Canadian plans.  

Our discount rate is important in determining the cost of our plans. A 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:  

     $25 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and  

     $4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans.  

Contributions Made and Benefits Paid  

During 2010:  

     We contributed approximately $150 million to our U.S. qualified pension plans.  

     We contributed approximately $23 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans.  

     We contributed approximately $6 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans in accordance with minimum funding rules in accordance with the respective provincial regulations. We also chose to make voluntary contributions of approximately $54 million to our largest registered plan during 2010.

     We made benefit payments of approximately $47 million related to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.  

During 2011:  

Based on estimated year end assets and projections of plan liabilities we expect to:  

     have a required contribution for our U.S. qualified plan for 2011 of approximately $20 million, which is payable by September 15, 2012;  

     be required to contribute approximately $80 million to our Canadian registered and nonregistered pension plans;  

     contribute $19 million to our U.S. nonqualified pension plans; and  

     make benefit payments of $44 million to our U.S. and Canadian other postretirement plans.  

LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our books.  

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is less than fair market value. Fair market value is the estimated amount we would get if we were to sell the assets.  

In determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:  

     future cash flows,  

     residual values and  

     fair values of the assets.  

Key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:  

     probability of alternative outcomes,  

     product pricing,  

     raw material costs,  

     product sales and  

     discount rate.  

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: REAL ESTATE  

We review homebuilding long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We recorded long-lived homebuilding asset impairments and related charges attributable to Weyerhaeuser shareholders of $21 million in 2010, $261 million in 2009 and $1.1 billion in 2008.  

Real Estate Held for Development  

Real estate held for development includes subdivisions and master planned communities (MPCs). MPCs typically include several product segments such as residential, active adult, retail and commercial. We evaluate impairment at the subdivision or MPC product segment level. Factors that are considered when evaluating a subdivision or MPC product segment for impairment include:  

     gross margins and selling costs on homes closed in recent months;  

     projected gross margins and selling costs based on our operating budgets;  

     competitor pricing and incentives in the same or nearby communities; and  

     trends in average selling prices, discounts, incentives, sales velocity and cancellations.  

We update the undiscounted cash flow forecast for each subdivision and MPC product segment that may be impaired. The undiscounted cash flow forecasts are affected by community-specific factors that include:  

     estimates and timing of future revenues;  

     estimates and timing of future land development, materials, labor and contractor costs;  

     community location and desirability, including availability of schools, retail, mass transit and other services;  

     local economic and demographic trends regarding employment, new jobs and taxes;  

     competitor presence, product types, future competition, pricing, incentives and discounts; and  

     land availability, number of lots we own or control, entitlement restrictions and alternative uses.  

The carrying amount of each subdivision and MPC product segment is written down to fair value when the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a subdivision or MPC product segment. An impairment charge for a subdivision or MPC product segment is allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot.  

Real Estate Held for Sale  

Real estate held for sale includes homes that have been completed and land that we intend to sell. We regularly sell land or lots that do not fit our value proposition or development plans.  

The carrying amount of real estate held for sale is reduced to fair value less estimated costs to sell if the forecasted net proceeds are less than the carrying amount. The fair value analysis is affected by local market economic conditions, demographic factors and competitor actions, and is inherently

 uncertain. Actual net proceeds can differ from the estimates. The carrying amount of real estate held for sale is evaluated quarterly.  

Market Approach  

We use the market approach to determine fair value of real estate held for development and held for sale when information for comparable assets is available. This approach is commonly used for our active projects where we are selling product. We typically use:  

     sales prices for comparable assets,  

     market studies,  

     appraisals or  

     legitimate offers.  

Income Approach  

We generally use the income approach to determine fair value of real estate for our inactive projects. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The fair value measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations regarding those future estimated cash inflows and outflows. We use present value techniques based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. Discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows of our homebuilding assets in 2010 ranged from 15 percent to 18 percent. The income approach relies on management judgment regarding the various inputs to the undiscounted cash flow forecasts.  

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.  

We record contingent liabilities when:  

     it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and  

     the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:  

     historical experience,  

     judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and  

     recommendations of legal counsel.  

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.  

While we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. See Note 16: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

DEPLETION  

We record depletion  the costs attributed to timber harvested  as trees are harvested.  

To calculate our depletion rate, which is updated annually, we:  

     take the total carrying cost of the timber and  

     divide by the total timber volume estimated to be harvested during the harvest cycle.  

Estimating the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle requires the consideration of the following factors:  

     changes in weather patterns,  

     effect of fertilizer and pesticide applications,  

     changes in environmental regulations and restrictions,  

     limits on harvesting certain timberlands,  

     changes in harvest plans,  

     scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology and  

     changes in harvest cycles.  

In addition, the length of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.  

Depletion-rate calculations do not include estimates for:  

     future silviculture  or sustainable forest management  costs associated with existing stands;  

     future reforestation costs associated with a stands final harvest; and  

     future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
