Basis of Reportable Segments

We report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). We have four reportable operating segments: Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group, Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group (individually, a "Reportable Segment" and collectively, the “Reportable Segments”). Factors considered in determining our Reportable Segments include the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to our Board of Directors. We report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see pages 8 through 17 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial information about each Reportable Segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the Reportable Segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from operations. The accounting policies of the Reportable Segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44 through 48 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Paint Stores Group

The Paint Stores Group consisted of 4,180 company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Maarten, Jamaica, Curacao, Aruba, St. Lucia and Barbados at December 31, 2016. Each store in this segment is engaged in the related business activity of selling paint, coatings and related products to end-use customers. The Paint Stores Group markets and sells Sherwin-Williams® branded architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) product finishes and related items. These products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment. During 2016, this segment opened 94 net new stores, consisting of 109 new stores opened (86 in the United States, 21 in Canada, 1 in Aruba and 1 in Barbados) and 15 stores closed (9 in the United States and 6 in Canada). During 2015, this segment opened 83 net new stores. During 2014, this segment opened 95 net new stores. A map on the cover flap of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of paint stores and their geographic locations. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Paint Stores Group, supplemented with information by geographic region, product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Paint Stores Group as a whole. In 

1

accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Paint Stores Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

Consumer Group

The Consumer Group develops, manufactures and distributes a variety of paint, coatings and related products to third party customers primarily in the United States and Canada and the Paint Stores Group. Approximately 64 percent of the total sales of the Consumer Group in 2016 were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through the Paint Stores Group. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private labeled products are performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Consumer Group, supplemented with information by product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Consumer Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Consumer Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

Global Finishes Group

The Global Finishes Group develops, licenses, manufactures, distributes and sells a variety of protective and marine products, automotive finishes and refinish products, OEM product finishes and related products in North and South America, Europe and Asia. This segment meets the demands of its customers for a consistent worldwide product development, manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing business. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams® and other controlled brand products are distributed through the Paint Stores Group and this segment’s 288 company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third party distributors. During 2016, this segment opened 5 new branches (3 in the United States and 2 in Canada) and closed 13 branches (10 in the United States, 2 in Canada and 1 in Chile) for a net decrease of 8 branches. At December 31, 2016, the Global Finishes Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in 34 foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Global Finishes Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units, and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Global Finishes Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Global Finishes Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment. A map on the cover flap of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of branches and their geographic locations.

Latin America Coatings Group

The Latin America Coatings Group develops, licenses, manufactures, distributes and sells a variety of architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products in North and South America. This segment meets the demands of its customers for consistent regional product development, manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing business. Sherwin-Williams® and other controlled brand products are distributed through this segment’s 339 company-operated stores and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, licensees and other third party distributors. During 2016, this segment opened 49 new stores (31 in South America and 18 in Mexico) and closed 1 store in South America for a net increase of 48 stores. At December 31, 2016, the Latin America Coatings Group consisted of operations from subsidiaries in 9 foreign countries and 4 foreign joint ventures. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Latin America Coatings Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units, and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Latin America Coatings Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Latin America Coatings Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment. A map on the cover flap of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the number of stores and their geographic locations.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment was interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which were not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment did not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used 

2

by the Company in its primary businesses. Material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.

Segment Financial Information

For financial information regarding our Reportable Segments, including net external sales, segment profit, identifiable assets and other information by Reportable Segment, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 72 through 75 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding domestic and foreign operations is set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 73 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information regarding risks attendant to foreign operations is set forth on page 31 of our 2016 Annual Report under the caption “Market Risk” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Developments

For additional information regarding our business and business developments, see pages 8 through 17 of our 2016 Annual Report and the “Letter to Shareholders” on pages 2 through 7 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale

We believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business. There are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the Reportable Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2017. See Item 1A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see pages 26 through 31 of our 2016 Annual Report under the caption “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Trademarks and Trade Names

Customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major trademarks and trade names used by each of the Reportable Segments are set forth below.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment, the Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade names to foreign companies.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products through 2017.

Research and Development

For information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 47 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets.

In the Paint Stores Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private labeled paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment.

The Global Finishes Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price.

In the Latin America Coatings Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors are the availability of property and price.
