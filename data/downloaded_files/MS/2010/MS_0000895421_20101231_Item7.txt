Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Introduction.  

Morgan Stanley, a financial holding company, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segmentsInstitutional Securities, Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management. The Company, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Morgan Stanley and the Company mean Morgan Stanley and its consolidated subsidiaries.  

A summary of the activities of each of the Companys business segments is as follows:  

Institutional Securities provides capital raising; financial advisory services, including advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance; corporate lending; sales, trading, financing and market-making activities in equity and fixed income securities and related products, including foreign exchange and commodities; and investment activities.  

Global Wealth Management Group, which includes the Companys 51% interest in Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC (MSSB), provides brokerage and investment advisory services to individual investors and small-to-medium sized businesses and institutions covering various investment alternatives; financial and wealth planning services; annuity and other insurance products; credit and other lending products; cash management services; retirement services; and trust and fiduciary services and engages in fixed income principal trading, which primarily facilitates clients trading or investments in such securities.  

Asset Management provides a broad array of investment strategies that span the risk/return spectrum across geographies, asset classes and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across the institutional and intermediary channels as well as high net worth clients.  

See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  

The results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors, including the effect of political and economic conditions and geopolitical events; the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income and credit markets, including corporate and mortgage (commercial and residential) lending and commercial real estate investments; the impact of current, pending and future legislation (including the Dodd-Frank Act), regulation (including capital requirements), and legal actions in the United States of America (U.S.) and worldwide; the level and volatility of equity, fixed income, and commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; the availability and cost of both credit and capital as well as the credit ratings assigned to the Companys unsecured short-term and long-term debt; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; the performance of the Companys acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other strategic arrangements (including MSSB and with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG)); the Companys reputation; inflation, natural disasters, and acts of war or terrorism; the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors and technological changes; or a combination of these or other factors. In addition, legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to the Companys businesses are likely to increase costs, thereby affecting results of operations. These factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect the Companys business, see Competition and Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1, and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.  

Change in Fiscal Year-End.  

On December 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) approved a change in the Companys fiscal year-end from November 30 to December 31 of each year. This change to the calendar year reporting cycle began January 1, 2009. As a result of the change, the Company had a one-month transition period in December 2008.  

The Companys results of operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 (2010), December 31, 2009 (2009), November 30, 2008 (fiscal 2008) and the one month ended December 31, 2008 are discussed below.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

N/MNot Meaningful.  

N/ANot Applicable. Information is not comparable.  

 (1) Information includes MSSB effective from May 31, 2009 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 (2) See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on discontinued operations.  

 (3) For the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (4) In 2010, regional net revenues, primarily in the Americas, were negatively impacted by the tightening of the Companys credit spreads, which resulted in the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term structured notes. In 2009, regional net revenues, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa, were negatively impacted by the tightening of the Companys credit spreads. For a discussion of the Companys methodology used to allocate revenues among the regions, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (5) The computation of average common equity for each business segment in 2010 is determined using the Companys Required Capital framework (Required Capital Framework), an internal capital adequacy measure (see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRequired Capital herein). Business segment capital prior to 2010 has not been restated under this framework. As a result, the business segments return on average common equity from continuing operations prior to 2010 is not available. The Required Capital framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. The return on average common equity uses income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity. The effective tax rates used in the computation of business segment return on average common equity were determined on a separate entity basis. Excluding the effect of the discrete tax benefits in 2010, the return on average common equity for the Institutional Securities business segment would have been 13% (see Executive SummarySignificant Items herein).  

 (6) Book value per common share equals common shareholders equity of $47,614 million at December 31, 2010, $37,091 million at December 31, 2009, $31,676 million at November 30, 2008 and $29,585 million at December 31, 2008, divided by common shares outstanding of 1,512 million at December 31, 2010, 1,361 million at December 31, 2009, 1,048 million at November 30, 2008 and 1,074 million at December 31, 2008. Book value per common share in 2010 included a benefit of approximately $1.40 per share due to the issuance of 116 million shares of common stock corresponding to the mandatory redemption of the junior subordinated debentures underlying $5.6 billion of equity units (see Other MattersRedemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein).  

 (7) Tangible common equity is a non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy. For a discussion of tangible common equity, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Balance Sheet herein.  

 (8) Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding.  

 (9) For a discussion of the effective income tax rate, see Executive SummarySignificant Items herein.  

 (10) Worldwide employees at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include additional worldwide employees of businesses contributed by Citigroup, Inc. (Citi) related to MSSB.  

 (11) For a discussion of average liquidity, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity Management PoliciesLiquidity Reserves herein.  

 (12) Tier 1 common ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy. For a discussion of total capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory Requirements herein. For a discussion of Tier 1 common ratio, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Balance Sheet herein.  

 (13) Amount excludes substantially all of the Companys retail asset management business (Retail Asset Management) that was sold to Invesco Ltd. (Invesco) (see Executive SummarySignificant Items herein).  

 (14) Revenues and expenses associated with these assets are included in the Companys Asset Management and Global Wealth Management Group business segments.  

 (15) Amounts include Asset Managements proportionate share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a minority stake.

 (16) Pre-tax profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess operating performance. Percentages represent income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.  

 (17) Global representatives at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include additional global representatives of businesses contributed by Citi related to MSSB.  

 (18) Annualized net revenues per global representative for 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008 equals Global Wealth Management Groups net revenues (excluding the sale of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management S.V., S.A.U. (MSWM S.V.) for fiscal 2008) divided by the quarterly weighted average global representative headcount for 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  

 (19) Beginning in 2009, amounts for Corporate and other accounts are presented in the appropriate client segment.  

 (20) Client assets per global representative equal total period-end client assets divided by period-end global representative headcount.  

 (21) Approximately $55 billion and $54 billion of the bank deposit balances at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, are held at Company-affiliated depositories with the remainder held at Citi-affiliated depositories. These deposit balances are held at certain of the Companys Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) insured depository institutions for the benefit of the Companys clients through their accounts.  

Global Market and Economic Conditions in 2010.  

Global market and economic conditions continued to improve, and global capital markets continued to recover, during 2010 and 2009, as compared with the severe economic and financial downturn that occurred in the fall of 2008.  

In the U.S., major equity market indices ended 2010 higher compared with the beginning of the year. The increase was primarily due to better than expected corporate earnings. Positive market and economic developments were partially offset by a persistently high unemployment rate, continued investor concerns about U.S. regulatory reform within the financial services industry, a sharp temporary decline in stock prices on May 6, 2010 (speculated to have been caused by high-speed electronic trading) and the continued sovereign debt crisis within the European region. Government and business spending increased, while certain sectors of the real estate market remained challenged. Consumer spending began to show signs of improvement toward the end of the year. Deficit reductions and balanced budgets remain critical items at the federal, state and local levels of government. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.4% at December 31, 2010 from 9.9% at December 31, 2009. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) kept key interest rates at historically low levels, and at December 31, 2010, the federal funds target rate was between zero and 0.25%, and the discount rate was 0.75%. The FOMC pursued quantitative easing policies during 2010 and 2009, in which the FOMC purchased securities with the objective of improving economic conditions by increasing the money supply.  

In Europe, equity market indices in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Germany ended 2010 higher, while in France, they ended lower, as compared with the beginning of the year. Results in the European equity markets were impacted by adverse economic developments, including investor concerns about the outcome of regulatory stress testing of European banks and the sovereign debt crisis, especially in Greece and Ireland. Industrial output in the region was primarily driven by German exports. The euro area unemployment rate remained relatively unchanged at approximately 10% at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, the European Central Banks benchmark interest rate was 1.00% and the Bank of Englands (BOE) benchmark interest rate was 0.50%. The BOE pursued quantitative easing policies during 2010 and 2009, in which the BOE purchased securities, including U.K. Government Gilts, with the objective of improving economic conditions by increasing the money supply.  

In Asia, industrial output was driven by exports from both China and Japan. Chinas economy also continued to benefit from government spending for capital projects, a significant amount of foreign currency reserves and a relatively high domestic savings rate. Equity markets in Hong Kong ended 2010 higher compared with the beginning of the year, while results in China and Japan were lower, as compared with the beginning of the year. During 2010, the Peoples Bank of China raised the one-year yuan lending rate by 0.50% from 5.31% to 5.81%, and the one-year yuan deposit rate by 0.50% from 2.25% to 2.75% (on two separate occasions: 0.25% in October 2010 and 0.25% in December 2010). In February 2011, the Peoples Bank of China raised the one-year yuan lending rate by 0.25% from 5.81% to 6.06% and the one-year yuan deposit rate by 0.25% from 2.75% to 3.00%.

Overview of 2010 Financial Results.  

Consolidated Review. The Company recorded net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $4,703 million in 2010, a 249% increase from $1,346 million in 2009.  

Net revenues increased 35% to $31,622 million in 2010 from $23,434 million in 2009, primarily driven by the Institutional Securities business segment and MSSB. Net revenues in 2010 included negative revenues of $873 million due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads on certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected, compared with negative revenues of $5,510 million in 2009 due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings. In addition, results for 2010 included a pre-tax gain of $668 million from the sale of the Companys investment in China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC). Non-interest expenses increased 13% to $25,420 million in 2010. Compensation and benefits expense increased 11% and non-compensation expenses increased 17%, primarily due to increased compensation costs and non-compensation costs in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment, primarily due to MSSB. The increase was also due to a charge of $272 million related to the U.K. governments payroll tax on discretionary bonuses reflected in 2010 compensation and benefits expense. Diluted EPS were $2.63 in 2010 compared with $(0.77) in 2009. Diluted EPS from continuing operations were $2.44 in 2010 compared with $(0.82) in 2009.  

The Companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 11.9% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2010 includes tax benefits of $382 million related to the reversal of U.S. deferred tax liabilities associated with prior-years undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were determined to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, $345 million associated with the remeasurement of net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest based on new information regarding the status of federal and state examinations, and $277 million associated with the planned repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. Excluding the benefits noted above, the effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2010 would have been 28.0%. The annual effective tax rate in 2010 is reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.  

The Companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was a benefit of 34.7% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2009 includes a tax benefit of $331 million resulting from the cost of anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates. Excluding this benefit, the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2009 would have been a benefit of 1.0%. The annual effective tax rate in 2009 is reflective of the geographic mix of earnings and includes tax benefits associated with the anticipated use of domestic tax credits and the utilization of state net operating losses.  

Discontinued operations for 2010 included: a loss of $1.2 billion due to a writedown and related costs associated with the planned disposition of Revel Entertainment Group, LLC (Revel), a development stage enterprise and subsidiary of the Company that is primarily associated with a development property in Atlantic City, New Jersey; a gain of $775 million related to a legal settlement with Discover Financial Services (DFS); and an after-tax gain of approximately $570 million related to the Companys sale of Retail Asset Management, including Van Kampen Investments, Inc. (Van Kampen), to Invesco.  

Institutional Securities. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $4,338 million in 2010 compared with $1,088 million in 2009. Net revenues were $16,366 million in 2010 compared with $12,853 million in 2009. Investment banking revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower revenues from equity underwriting and lower advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions, partially offset by higher revenues from fixed income underwriting. Investment banking revenues in 2010 were also impacted by the deconsolidation of the majority of the Companys Japanese investment banking business as a result of the closing of the transaction between the Company and MUFG to form a joint venture in Japan (the MUFG Transaction) (see Other MattersJapan Securities Joint Venture herein). Equity sales and trading revenues increased 31% to $4,840 million in 2010 from $3,690 million in 2009. Equity sales and trading revenues reflected negative revenue of approximately $121 million in 2010 due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting

 from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected, compared with negative revenues of approximately $1,738 million in 2009. Lower results in the cash and derivatives businesses in 2010 reflected solid customer flows offset by a challenging trading environment. Fixed income sales and trading revenues in 2010 increased 21% to $5,867 million in 2010 from $4,854 million in 2009. Fixed income sales and trading revenues reflected negative revenues of approximately $703 million in 2010 due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected compared with negative revenues of approximately $3,321 million in 2009. Interest rate and currency product revenues decreased 38% in 2010 reflecting lower trading results across most businesses. Results for 2010 primarily reflected solid customer flows in interest rate, credit and currency products, which were partly offset by a challenging trading environment. Principal transaction net investment gains of $809 million were recognized in 2010 compared with net investment losses of $864 million in 2009. Non-interest expenses increased 2% to $12,028 million in 2010 from $11,765 million in 2009. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased 2% in 2010.  

Global Wealth Management Group. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,156 million in 2010 compared with $559 million in 2009. Net revenues were $12,636 million compared with $9,390 million in 2009. Investment banking revenues increased 39% in 2010, primarily benefiting from a full year of MSSB and higher closed-end fund activity. Principal transactions trading revenues increased 8% in 2010, primarily benefiting from a full year of MSSB, net gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and gains on certain investments. Commission revenues increased 28% in 2010, primarily benefiting from a full year of MSSB and higher client activity. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 39% in 2010 benefiting from a full year of MSSB and improved market conditions. Net interest increased 70% in 2010 primarily resulting from an increase in interest income benefiting from a full year of MSSB, the Securities Available for Sale (AFS) portfolio and the change in classification of the bank deposit program, partially offset by increased funding costs (see Global Wealth Management GroupAsset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees herein). Non-interest expenses were $11,480 million in 2010 compared with $8,831 million in 2009. 

Asset Management. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $723 million in 2010 compared with a loss of $653 million in 2009. Net revenues were $2,723 million in 2010 compared with $1,337 million in 2009. The Company recorded principal transactions net investment gains of $996 million in 2010 compared with losses of $173 million in 2009. Non-interest expenses were $2,000 million in 2010 compared with $1,990 million in 2009.  

Significant Items.  

Mortgage-Related Trading. The Company recorded mortgage-related trading gains (losses) primarily related to commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial whole loan positions, U.S. subprime mortgage proprietary trading exposures and non-subprime residential mortgages of $1.2 billion, $(0.6) billion, $(2.6) billion and $(0.1) billion in 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.

Real Estate Investments. The Company recorded gains (losses) in the following business segments related to real estate investments. These amounts exclude investments associated with certain deferred compensation and employee co-investment plans.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Gains (losses) related to net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from the Companys limited partnership investments in real estate funds and are reflected in Principal transactionsInvestments in the consolidated statements of income.  

 (2) On March 31, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a plan of disposal by sale for Revel. The results of Revel, including the estimated loss from the planned disposal, are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented within the Institutional Securities business segment. In the Asset Management business segment, amounts related to the disposition of Crescent Real Estate Equities Limited Partnership (Crescent), which was disposed in the fourth quarter of 2009 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 (3) Gains (losses) related to net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from real estate investments in the Companys merchant banking business and are reflected in Principal transactionsInvestments in the consolidated statements of income. 

See Other MattersReal Estate herein for further information.  

Income Tax Benefit. The Company recognized tax benefits of $382 million related to the reversal of U.S. deferred tax liabilities associated with prior-years undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were determined to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, $345 million associated with the remeasurement of net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest based on new information regarding the status of federal and state examinations, and $277 million associated with the planned repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $331 million in 2009, resulting from the cost of anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at lower than previously estimated tax rates.  

Morgan Stanley Debt. Net revenues reflected negative revenues of $873 million, $5.5 billion and $0.2 billion in 2010, 2009 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively, from the tightening of the Companys credit spreads, and gains of $5.6 billion in fiscal 2008 from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long-term and short-term borrowings, including structured notes and junior subordinated debentures that are accounted for at fair value.  

In addition, in 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded gains of approximately $491 million, $2.3 billion and $73 million, respectively, from repurchasing its debt in the open market. In fiscal 2008, the Company also recorded mark-to-market gains of approximately $1.4 billion on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long-term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company (i.e., the swaps were de-designated as hedges). During the period the swaps were hedging the debt, changes in fair value of these instruments were generally offset by adjustments to the basis of the debt being hedged.

Monoline Insurers. Monoline insurers (Monolines) provide credit enhancement to capital markets transactions. The current credit environment continues to affect the ability of such financial guarantors to provide enhancement to existing capital market transactions. The Companys direct exposure to Monolines is limited to bonds that are insured by Monolines and to derivative contracts with a Monoline as counterparty (principally an affiliate of MBIA Inc. (MBIA)).  

The Companys exposure to Monolines at December 31, 2010 includes $1.5 billion in insured municipal bond securities and $326 million of mortgage and asset-backed securities enhanced by financial guarantees. Excluding MBIA, derivative counterparty exposure includes gross exposures of approximately $440 million, net of cumulative credit valuation adjustments and hedges. The positive net derivative counterparty exposure (the sum of net long positions for each individual counterparty) was insignificant at December 31, 2010. Positive net derivative counterparty exposure is defined as potential loss to the Company over a period of time in an event of 100% default of a Monoline, assuming zero recovery. Amounts related to MBIA derivative counterparty exposure are not included in the above amounts since, at December 31, 2010, the aggregate value of cumulative credit valuation adjustments and hedges exceeded the amount of gross exposure of $4.2 billion by $1.1 billion.  

The results for 2010 included losses of $865 million related to the Companys Monoline counterparty credit exposures, principally MBIA, compared with losses of $232 million, $1.7 billion and $203 million in 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively. The Companys hedging program for Monoline counterparty exposure continues to become more costly and difficult to effect, and, as such, the losses in 2010 reflected those additional costs as well as volatility on those hedges caused by the tightening of both MBIA and commercial mortgage-backed spreads. The Company proactively manages its Monoline exposure; however, as market conditions continue to evolve, significant additional losses could be incurred. The Companys hedging program includes the use of single name and index transactions that mitigate credit exposure to the Monolines as well as certain market risk components of existing underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions with the Monolines and is conducted as part of the Companys overall market risk management. See Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market RiskRisk ManagementMarket Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein.  

Settlement with DFS. On June 30, 2007, the Company completed the spin-off of its business segment DFS to its shareholders. On February 11, 2010, DFS paid the Company $775 million in complete satisfaction of its obligations to the Company regarding the sharing of proceeds from a lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard. The payment was recorded as a gain in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for 2010.  

Gain on Sale of Noncontrolling Interest. In connection with the MUFG Transaction (see Other MattersJapan Securities Joint Venture herein), the Company recorded an after-tax gain of $731 million from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in its Japanese institutional securities business. This gain was recorded in Paid-in capital in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2010 and changes in total equity for 2010.  

Gain on Sale of Retail Asset Management. On June 1, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Retail Asset Management, including Van Kampen, to Invesco. The Company received $800 million in cash and approximately 30.9 million shares of Invesco stock upon sale, resulting in a cumulative after-tax gain of $682 million, of which $570 million was recorded in 2010. The remaining gain, representing tax basis benefits, was recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. The results of Retail Asset Management are reported as discontinued operations within the Asset Management business segment for all periods presented through the date of divestiture. The Company recorded the 30.9 million shares as securities available for sale. In November 2010, the Company sold its investment in Invesco, resulting in a realized gain of approximately $102 million reported within Other revenues in the consolidated statement of income for 2010.  

Sale of Stake in CICC. In December 2010, the Company completed the sale of its 34.3% stake in CICC for a pre-tax gain of approximately $668 million, which is included within Other revenues in the consolidated statement of income for 2010. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.

Corporate Lending. The Company recorded the following amounts primarily associated with loans and lending commitments carried at fair value within the Institutional Securities business segment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Amounts include realized and unrealized gains (losses).  

U.K. Tax. During 2010, the Company recognized a charge of approximately $272 million in Compensation and benefits expense representing the final amount paid relating to the U.K. governments payroll tax on discretionary above-base compensation.  

OIS Fair Value Measurement. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company began using the overnight indexed swap (OIS) curve as an input to value substantially all of its collateralized interest rate derivative contracts. The Company believes using the OIS curve, which reflects the interest rate typically paid on cash collateral, more accurately reflects the fair value of collateralized interest rate derivative contracts. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $176 million in Principal transactionsTrading upon application of the OIS curve within the Institutional Securities business segment. Previously, the Company discounted these collateralized interest rate derivative contracts based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). 

Goodwill and Intangibles. Impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets were $201 million, $16 million and $725 million in 2010, 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). The impairment charges for 2010 included $193 million related to FrontPoint Partners LLC (FrontPoint), as described below.  

FrontPoint. In 2010, the Company reached an agreement with the principals of FrontPoint, whereby FrontPoint senior management and portfolio managers will own a majority equity stake in FrontPoint, and the Company will retain a minority stake. FrontPoint will replace the Companys affiliates as the investment advisor and general partner of the FrontPoint funds. The Company expects this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2011, subject to closing conditions. The Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $126 million related to the transaction in 2010, which were included in Other revenues in the consolidated statement of income.  

In addition, the Company recorded approximately $67 million related to the writedown of certain intangible assets in 2010, included in Other expenses in the consolidated statement of income.  

MSCI. In May 2009, the Company divested all of its remaining ownership interest in MSCI Inc. (MSCI). The gain on sale, net of taxes, was approximately $279 million and $895 million, related to the secondary offerings, for 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The results of MSCI are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of divestiture. The results of MSCI were formerly included in the continuing operations of the Institutional Securities business segment.  

Sale of Bankruptcy Claims. In 2009, the Company recorded a gain of $319 million related to the sale of undivided participating interests in a portion of the Companys claims against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Structured Investment Vehicles. The Company recognized gains of $164 million in 2009 and losses of $470 million and $84 million in fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively, related to securities issued by structured investment vehicles (SIV). The gains were recorded in the Asset Management business segment.

Subsidiary Banks. The Company recorded losses of approximately $70 million, gains of approximately $140 million and losses of approximately $900 million in 2010, 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, related to securities portfolios in the Companys domestic subsidiary banks, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (formerly, Morgan Stanley Trust FSB) (the Subsidiary Banks).  

ARS. Under the terms of various agreements entered into with government agencies and the terms of the Companys announced offer to repurchase, the Company agreed to repurchase at par certain Auction Rate Securities (ARS) held by retail clients that were purchased through the Company. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse retail clients who have sold certain ARS purchased through the Company at a loss. Fiscal 2008 reflected charges of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program and writedowns of $108 million associated with ARS held in inventory.  

Sales of Subsidiaries and Other Items. Results for fiscal 2008 included a pre-tax gain of $687 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V. (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Business Segments.  

Substantially all of the Companys operating revenues and operating expenses can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures.  

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations primarily represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by the Asset Management business segment to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to the Global Wealth Management Group business segments global representatives. Intersegment Eliminations also reflect the effect of fees paid by the Institutional Securities business segment to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment related to the bank deposit program. Losses from continuing operations before income taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations were $15 million, $11 million, $17 million and $1 million in 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  

From June 2009 until April 1, 2010, in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment, revenues in the bank deposit program were primarily included in Asset management, distribution and administration fees. Prior to June 2009, these revenues were previously reported in Interest income. The change was the result of agreements that were entered into in connection with the MSSB transaction. Beginning on April 1, 2010, revenues in the bank deposit program held at the Companys depository institutions are recorded as Interest income, due to renegotiations of the revenue sharing agreement as part of the Global Wealth Management Group business segments retail banking strategy. The Global Wealth Management Group business segment will continue to earn referral fees for deposits placed with Citi depository institutions, and these fees will continue to be recorded in Asset management, distribution and administration fees until the legacy Smith Barney deposits are migrated to the Companys depository institutions.  

Effective January 1, 2010, certain transfer pricing arrangements between the Global Wealth Management Group business segment and the Institutional Securities business segment relating to Global Wealth Management Group business segments fixed income trading activities were modified to conform to agreements with Citi in connection with MSSB.  

In addition, with an effective date of January 1, 2010, the Global Wealth Management Group business segment sold approximately $3 billion of ARS to the Institutional Securities business segment at book value.

The Company changed the allocation methodology in the Institutional Securities business segment for funding costs centrally managed by the Companys Treasury Department between equity and fixed income sales and trading to more accurately reflect business activity. Effective January 1, 2010, funding costs were allocated 35% to equity sales and trading and 65% to fixed income sales and trading. Prior to January 1, 2010, funding costs were allocated 20% and 80% to equity and fixed income sales and trading, respectively. The Company regularly evaluates the appropriateness of funding cost allocations with respect to business activities and may, in the future, modify further the allocation percentages.  

Effective January 1, 2010, in the Institutional Securities business segment, Equity sales and trading revenues include Asset management, distribution and administration fees as these fees relate to administrative services primarily provided to the Companys prime brokerage clients and, therefore, closely align to equity sales and trading revenues. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

 (1) All prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.  

Sales and Trading.  

Sales and trading revenues are composed of Principal transactionsTrading revenues; Commissions; Asset management, distribution and administration fees; and Net interest revenues (expenses). In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views Principal transactionsTrading; Commissions; Asset management, distribution and administration fees; and Net interest revenues (expenses) in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions, and other related expenses.  

Sales and trading revenues were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) All prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. See Business Segments and Other MattersDividend Income herein for further information.  

The components of the Companys sales and trading revenues are as follows:  

Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transactionsTrading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions, as well as proprietary trading activities for its own account.  

Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over-the-counter (OTC) equity securities and options.  

    57      

Table of Contents 

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with administrative services primarily provided to the Companys prime brokerage clients.  

Net Interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and Securities borrowed and Securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions.  

Sales and trading revenues by business were as follows:

 (1) All prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.  

 (2) Other sales and trading net revenues primarily included net gains (losses) from loans and lending commitments and related hedges associated with the Companys lending and other corporate activities. Other sales and trading net revenues also included net losses associated with costs related to the amount of liquidity (negative carry) in the Subsidiary Banks.  

2010 Compared with 2009.  

Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues decreased 4% in 2010 from 2009, reflecting lower revenues from equity underwriting and lower advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions, partially offset by higher revenues from fixed income underwriting. Investment banking revenues in 2010 were also impacted by the deconsolidation of the majority of the Companys Japanese investment banking business as a result of the MUFG Transaction (see Other MattersJapan Securities Joint Venture herein). Overall, underwriting revenues of $2,825 million decreased 5% from 2009. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 14% to $1,454 million, primarily due to lower market volume. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 8% to $1,371 million, primarily due to increased high-yield issuance volumes and higher loan syndication fees. Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,470 million, a decrease of 1% from 2009.  

Sales and Trading Revenues. Total sales and trading revenues increased 18% in 2010 from 2009, reflecting higher equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues, partially offset by losses in other sales and trading.  

Equity. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 31% to $4,840 million in 2010 from $3,690 million in 2009. Equity sales and trading revenues reflected negative revenues of approximately $121 million in 2010 due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected compared with negative revenues of approximately $1,738 million in 2009. Despite solid customer flows, a challenging trading environment resulted in lower revenues in the cash and derivatives businesses in 2010. Results in 2010 reflected higher revenues in prime brokerage due to higher client balances compared with 2009.  

58  

Table of Contents 

In 2010, equity sales and trading revenues also reflected unrealized gains of approximately $20 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of counterparties credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized gains of approximately $198 million in 2009. The Company also recorded unrealized gains of $31 million in 2010 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized losses of approximately $154 million in 2009 from the tightening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized gains and losses on credit default swap spreads do not reflect any gains or losses on related hedging instruments.  

Fixed Income. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 21% to $5,867 million in 2010 from $4,854 million in 2009. Results in 2010 included negative revenues of approximately $703 million due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected compared with negative revenues of approximately $3,321 million in 2009. Interest rate, credit and currency product revenues decreased 38% in 2010, reflecting lower trading results across most businesses. Results for 2010 primarily reflected solid customer flows in interest rate, credit and currency products, which were partly offset by a challenging trading environment. Interest rate, credit and currency product net revenues in 2010 were also negatively impacted by losses of $865 million from Monolines compared with losses of $232 million in 2009. Results in interest rate, credit and currency products also included a gain of approximately $123 million related to a change in the fair value measurement methodology to use the OIS curve as an input to value substantially all collateralized interest rate derivative contracts (see Overview of 2010 Financial ResultsSignificant ItemsOIS Fair Value Measurement herein and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Commodity net revenues decreased 27% in 2010, primarily due to low levels of client activity and market volatility. Results in 2009 included a gain of approximately $319 million related to the sale of undivided participating interests in a portion of the Companys claims against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).  

In 2010, fixed income sales and trading revenues reflected net unrealized gains of $603 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of counterparties credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized gains of approximately $3,462 million in 2009. The Company also recorded unrealized gains of $287 million in 2010 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized losses of approximately $1,938 million in 2009 from the tightening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized gains and losses on credit default swap spreads do not reflect any gains or losses on related hedging instruments.  

Other. In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues included other trading revenues, consisting primarily of certain activities associated with the Companys corporate activities. In connection with its corporate lending activities, the Company provides to select clients loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) that are generally classified as either event-driven or relationship-driven. Event-driven loans and lending commitments refer to activities associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition or recapitalization transactions. Relationship-driven loans and lending commitments are generally made to expand business relationships with select clients. For further information about the Companys corporate lending activities, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk herein. The fair value measurement of loans and lending commitments takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract. The valuation of these commitments could change in future periods depending on, among other things, the extent that they are renegotiated or repriced or if the associated acquisition transaction does not occur. Other sales and trading also includes costs related to negative carry.  

In 2010, other sales and trading net revenues reflected a net loss of $441 million compared with net gains of $173 million in 2009. Results in 2010 primarily included net losses of approximately $342 million (mark-to-market  

59  

Table of Contents 

 valuations and realized gains of approximately $327 million offset by losses on related hedges of approximately $669 million) associated with loans and lending commitments and the costs related to negative carry in the Subsidiary Banks. Results in 2009 included net gains of approximately $804 million (mark-to-market valuations and realized gains of approximately $4,042 million, partially offset by losses on related hedges of approximately $3,238 million) associated with loans and lending commitments. Results in 2009 also included losses of $362 million, reflecting the improvement in the Companys debt-related credit spreads on certain debt related to China Investment Corporations (CIC) investment in the Company. Results in 2010 also included a gain of approximately $53 million related to the OIS curve fair value methodology referred to above (see Overview of 2010 Financial ResultsSignificant ItemsOIS Fair Value Measurement and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Principal TransactionsInvestments. The Companys investments generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.  

Principal transaction net investment gains of $809 million were recognized in 2010 compared with net investment losses of $864 million in 2009. The results for 2010 reflected a gain of $313 million on a principal investment held by a consolidated investment partnership, which was sold in 2010. The portion of the gain related to third-party investors amounted to $183 million and was recorded in the net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statement of income. The results in 2010 also reflected gains on principal investments in real estate funds and investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans compared with losses on such investments in 2009.  

Other. Other revenues increased 83% in 2010, primarily reflecting a pre-tax gain of $668 million from the sale of the Companys investment in CICC. Results in 2009 included gains of approximately $465 million from the Companys repurchase of its debt in the open market.  

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased 2% in 2010, primarily due to higher non-compensation expenses, partially offset by lower compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased 2% in 2010, primarily due to lower net revenues, excluding the impact of negative revenues related to the Companys debt-related credit spreads. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2010 included a charge of approximately $269 million related to the U.K. governments payroll tax on discretionary above-base compensation. Non-compensation expenses increased 9% in 2010. Brokerage and clearing expense increased 18% in 2010, primarily due to higher levels of business activity. Information processing and communications expense increased 12% in 2010, primarily due to ongoing investments in technology. Marketing and business development expense increased 35% in 2010, primarily due to higher levels of business activity. Professional services expense increased 9% in 2010, primarily due to higher technology consulting expenses and higher legal fees. Other expenses decreased 6% in 2010, primarily related to insurance recoveries reflected in 2010 and a loss provision in deferred compensation plans reflected in 2009. The decrease in 2010 was partially offset by higher provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, including $102.7 million related to the Assurance of Discontinuance that was entered into on June 24, 2010 between the Company and the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Massachusetts OAG) to resolve the Massachusetts OAGs investigation of the Companys financing, purchase and securitization of certain subprime residential mortgages.  

2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.  

Investment banking revenues increased 23% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, as higher revenues from equity and fixed income underwriting transactions were partially offset by lower advisory revenues. Underwriting revenues of $2,967 million increased 57% from fiscal 2008, reflecting higher levels of market activity, as equity underwriting revenues increased 62% to $1,695 million and fixed income underwriting revenues increased 51% to $1,272 million. Underwriting fees in 2009 reflected a significant increase in market activity from 2008 levels, which  

60  

Table of Contents 

 were affected by unprecedented market turmoil and challenging market conditions. In 2009, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,488 million, a decrease of 14% from fiscal 2008, reflecting lower levels of market activity.  

Total sales and trading revenues decreased 20% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, reflecting lower equity sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher other sales and trading revenues and by higher fixed income sales and trading revenues.  

Equity sales and trading revenues decreased 63% to $3,690 million in 2009 from fiscal 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to a significant reduction in net revenues from derivative products and equity cash products, reflecting lower levels of market volume and market volatility, reduced levels of client activity and lower average prime brokerage client balances. Equity sales and trading revenues reflected losses of $1,738 million due to the tightening of the Companys credit spreads during 2009 resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected compared with a benefit of approximately $1,604 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit spreads.  

In 2009, equity sales and trading revenues also reflected unrealized gains of approximately $198 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of counterparties credit default swap spreads compared with losses of $300 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of counterparties credit default swap spreads. The Company also recorded unrealized losses of approximately $154 million in 2009 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of the Companys credit default swap spreads compared with gains of $125 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized losses and gains do not reflect any gains or losses on related hedging instruments.  

Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 18% to $4,854 million in 2009 from fiscal 2008. Interest rate, currency and credit products net revenues increased 127% in 2009, primarily due to strong investment grade and distressed debt trading results, partly offset by lower levels of client activity. Results in 2009 also included a gain of $319 million related to the sale of undivided participating interests in a portion of the Companys claims against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection. Commodity net revenues decreased 31% in 2009, primarily reflecting reduced levels of client activity and unfavorable market conditions.  

In 2009, fixed income sales and trading revenues reflected net unrealized gains of approximately $3,462 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of counterparties credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized losses of approximately $6,560 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of counterparties credit default swap spreads. The Company also recorded unrealized losses of approximately $1,938 million in 2009, related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of the Companys credit default swap spreads compared with unrealized gains of approximately $1,968 million in fiscal 2008 related to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized losses and gains on credit default swap spreads do not reflect any gains or losses on related hedging instruments.  

In addition, fixed income sales and trading revenues in 2009 were negatively impacted by losses of approximately $3,321 million from the tightening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the increase in the fair value of certain of the Companys long-term and short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected. Fiscal 2008 reflected a benefit of approximately $3,524 million due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads on such borrowings.  

In 2009, other sales and trading net revenues reflected net gains of $173 million compared with net losses of $3,119 million in fiscal 2008. Results for 2009 included net gains of $804 million (mark-to-market valuations and realized gains of $4,042 million, partially offset by losses on related hedges of $3,238 million) associated  

61  

Table of Contents 

 with loans and lending commitments. Results for fiscal 2008 included net losses of $3,335 million (negative mark-to-market valuations and losses of $6,311 million, net of gains on related hedges of $2,976 million) associated with loans and lending commitments largely related to certain event-driven lending to non-investment grade companies. Results in 2009 also included losses of $362 million, reflecting the improvement in the Companys debt-related credit spreads on certain debt related to CICs investment in the Company compared with gains of $387 million in fiscal 2008.  

In fiscal 2008, other sales and trading revenues also included writedowns of securities of approximately $1.2 billion in the Companys Subsidiary Banks and mark-to-market gains of approximately $1.4 billion on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long-term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company.  

Principal transactions net investment losses of $864 million were recognized in 2009 as compared with net investment losses of $2,461 million in fiscal 2008. The losses were primarily related to net realized and unrealized losses from the Companys limited partnership investments in real estate funds and investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.  

Other revenues decreased 80% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. During 2009, the Company recorded gains of approximately $465 million from the Companys repurchase of debt in the open market compared with approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2008 (see Significant ItemsMorgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion).  

Non-interest expenses decreased 11% in 2009, primarily due to lower non-compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased 2% from fiscal 2008. Non-compensation expenses decreased 26% in 2009, partly due to the Companys initiatives to reduce costs. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 12% in 2009, primarily due to lower leasing costs associated with office facilities. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 20% in 2009, primarily due to decreased trading activity. Marketing and business development expense decreased 43% in 2009, primarily due to lower levels of business activity. Professional services expense decreased 18% in 2009, primarily due to lower consulting and legal fees. Other expenses decreased 50% in 2009. In fiscal 2008, other expenses included $694 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to certain fixed income businesses. Excluding the fiscal 2008 impairment charges, other expenses decreased in 2009, primarily due to lower levels of business activity and lower litigation expense.

Institutional Securities recorded losses before income taxes of $1,997 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008 compared with income before income taxes of $938 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007.

Principal TransactionsInvestments. Principal transaction net investment gains were $19 million in 2010 compared with $3 million in 2009. The increase primarily reflected gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with such investments in the prior-year period.  

Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commission revenues increased 28% in 2010, primarily benefiting from a full year of MSSB revenues and higher client activity.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from individual investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management, account services and administration. The Company also receives shareholder servicing fees and fees for services it provides in distributing certain open-ended mutual funds and other products. Mutual fund distribution fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 39% in 2010, primarily benefiting from a full year of MSSB revenues and improved market conditions. From June 2009 until April 1, 2010, revenues in the bank deposit program were primarily included in Asset management, distribution and administration fees. Prior to June 2009, these revenues were reported in Interest income. The change was the result of agreements that were entered into in connection with the MSSB transaction. Beginning on April 1, 2010, revenues in the bank deposit program held at the Companys U.S. depository institutions were recorded as Interest income due to renegotiations of the revenue sharing agreement as part of the Global Wealth Management Group business segments retail banking strategy. The Global Wealth Management Group business segment will continue to earn referral fees for deposits placed with Citi depository institutions, and these fees will continue to be recorded in Asset management, distribution and administration fees until the legacy Smith Barney deposits are migrated to the Companys U.S. depository institutions. The referral fees for deposits were $381.7 million in 2010 and $659.5 million in 2009.  

Balances in the bank deposit program increased to $113.3 billion at December 31, 2010 from $112.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The unlimited FDIC program expired on December 31, 2009 for deposits held by Citi depository institutions and June 30, 2010 for deposits held by the Companys depository institutions. Deposits held by Company-affiliated FDIC-insured depository institutions were $55 billion of the $113.3 billion deposits at December 31, 2010.  

Client assets in fee-based accounts increased to $470 billion and represented 28% of total client assets at December 31, 2010 compared with $379 billion and 24% at December 31, 2009, respectively. Total client asset balances increased to $1,669 billion at December 31, 2010 from $1,560 billion at December 31, 2009, primarily due to improved market conditions and an increase in net new assets. Net new assets for 2010 were $22.9 billion. Client asset balances in households with assets greater than $1 million increased to $1,229 billion at December 31, 2010 from $1,090 billion at December 31, 2009. Global fee-based asset flows increased to $32.7 billion at December 31, 2010 from $13.4 billion at December 31, 2009.  

Other. Other revenues primarily include customer account service fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues were $337 million in 2010, an increase of 35% from $249 million in 2009. Other revenues in 2010 primarily benefited from a full year of MSSB revenues and increases in proxy and other fee services.  

Net Interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including customer bank deposits and margin loans and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions. Net interest increased 70% in 2010, primarily resulting from an increase in Interest income due to a full year of MSSB net interest, the securities available for sale portfolio (see Other MattersSecurities Available for Sale herein) and the change in classification of the bank deposit program noted above, partially offset by increased funding costs.  

65  

Table of Contents 

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased 30% in 2010, primarily due to higher costs related to a full year of MSSB operating expenses and the amortization of MSSBs intangible assets. Compensation and benefits expense increased 28% in 2010, primarily due to a full year of MSSB operating expenses. Non-compensation expenses increased 34% in 2010. In 2010, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees expense increased 38%, information processing and communications expense increased 41%, and other expenses increased 51%, primarily due to a full year of MSSB operating expenses. In 2010, professional services expense increased 43%, primarily due to a full year of MSSB operating expenses and increased technology consulting costs related to the MSSB integration.  

2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.  

Investment banking revenues increased 40% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, primarily due to the consolidation of the operating revenues of MSSB and higher equity underwriting activity, partially offset by lower underwriting activity across fixed income and unit trust products. Principal transactions trading revenues increased 97% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, primarily due to the consolidation of the operating revenues of MSSB and higher revenues from municipal and corporate fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from government securities. The results in 2009 also reflected net gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Principal transactions net investment gains were $3 million in 2009 compared with net investment losses of $54 million in fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 primarily reflected net gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with losses on such plans in fiscal 2008. Commission revenues increased 48% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, reflecting the operating results of MSSB, partially offset by lower client activity. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 68% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to consolidating the operating revenues of MSSB, fees associated with customer account balances in the bank deposit program and the change in classification of the bank deposit program noted above. Balances in the bank deposit program rose to $112.5 billion at December 31, 2009 from $38.8 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily due to MSSB, which include balances held at Citis depository institutions. Deposits held by certain of the Companys FDIC-insured depository institutions were $54 billion of the $112.5 billion deposits at December 31, 2009. Client assets in fee-based accounts increased 175% to $379 billion at December 31, 2009 and represented 24% of total client assets compared with 25% at December 31, 2008. Total client asset balances increased to $1,560 billion at December 31, 2009 from $550 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily due to MSSB. Client asset balances in households greater than $1 million increased to $1,090 billion at December 31, 2009 from $351 billion at December 31, 2008.  

Other revenues decreased 74% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 included the operating revenues of MSSB. Fiscal 2008 results included $743 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V., the Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business, and the Global Wealth Management Group business segments share ($43 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt (see Overview of 2010 Financial ResultsMorgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion).  

Net interest revenues decreased 29% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the classification of the bank deposit program noted above, a decline in customer margin loan balances and increased funding costs.  

Non-interest expenses increased 51% in 2009 and included the operating costs of MSSB, the amortization of MSSBs intangible assets, and a one-time expense of $124 million, primarily for replacement deferred compensation awards. The cost of these replacement awards was fully allocated to Citi within noncontrolling interests. Compensation and benefits expense increased 60% in 2009, primarily reflecting MSSB and the replacement awards noted above. Non-compensation expenses increased 32%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 91%, primarily due to the consolidation of operating costs of MSSB and real estate abandonment charges. Information processing and communications expense increased 70%, and professional

 services expense increased 54% in 2009, primarily due to the consolidation of operating results of MSSB. Other expenses decreased 7% in 2009, primarily due to the charge of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program in fiscal 2008, partially offset by the consolidation of operating costs of MSSB and a charge related to an FDIC assessment on deposits.  

One Month Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with the One Month Ended December 31, 2007.  

The Global Wealth Management Group business segment recorded income before income taxes of $118 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008 compared with $103 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007. The one month ended December 31, 2008 included a reversal of a portion of approximately $70 million of the accrual related to the ARS repurchase program. Net revenues were $409 million, a 24% decrease, primarily related to lower asset management, distribution and administration fees, lower commissions and lower investment banking fees. Client assets in fee-based accounts decreased 31% to $138 billion and decreased as a percentage of total client assets to 25% from 27% at December 31, 2007. In addition, total client assets decreased to $550 billion, down 27% from December 31, 2007, primarily due to weakened market conditions.  

Total non-interest expenses were $291 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008, a 33% decrease from the prior period. Compensation and benefits expense was $247 million, a 21% decrease from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower revenues. Non-compensation costs decreased 65%, primarily due to a reversal of approximately $70 million of the accrual related to the ARS repurchase program.

ASSET MANAGEMENT  

INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On June 1, 2010, the Company completed the sale of Retail Asset Management, including Van Kampen, to Invesco. The Company recorded a cumulative after-tax gain of $682 million, of which approximately $570 million was recorded in 2010. The remaining gain, representing tax basis benefits, was recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. The results of Retail Asset Management are reported as discontinued operations through the date of sale within the Asset Management business segment. Noncontrolling interests relate to the consolidation of certain real estate funds sponsored by the Company. The increase in noncontrolling interests in 2010 is primarily related to principal investment gains of $444 million associated with these consolidated funds.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) The alternatives asset class includes a range of investment products such as hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, funds of private equity funds and funds of real estate funds.  

 (2) Amounts represent Asset Managements proportional share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a minority stake.  

2010 Compared with 2009.  

Investment Banking. Asset Management generates investment banking revenues primarily from the placement of investments in merchant banking funds. Investment banking revenues doubled in 2010 from 2009, primarily reflecting higher revenues from real estate and infrastructure products.  

Principal TransactionsTrading. In 2010, the Company recognized a loss of $49 million compared with a loss of $68 million in 2009. Trading results in 2010 and 2009 included losses from hedges on certain investments and long-term debt. Trading results in 2010 also included $25 million related to contributions to money market funds. Trading results in 2009 also included mark-to-market losses related to a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company, partially offset by gains of $164 million related to SIV positions that were previously held on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition.  

Principal TransactionsInvestments. Real estate and private equity investments generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.  

The Company recorded principal transactions net investment gains of $996 million in 2010 compared with losses of $173 million in 2009. The results in 2010 included a gain of $444 million associated with certain consolidated

Table of Contents 

 real estate funds sponsored by the Company and net investment gains in the merchant banking and core businesses, including certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. The results in 2009 primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys real estate investments and losses related to certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans, partially offset by net investment gains associated with the Companys alternatives business.  

Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues generated from the management and supervision of assets, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, and separately managed accounts and fees relating to the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds. Asset management fees arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees are earned on certain funds as a percentage of appreciation earned by those funds and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 4% in 2010, primarily reflecting higher fund management and administration fees, partially offset by lower performance fees. The higher fund management and administration fees reflected an increase in average assets under management. The Companys assets under management increased $13 billion from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 reflecting market appreciation, partially offset by net customer outflows, primarily in the Companys money market funds. The Company recorded net customer outflows of $5.7 billion in 2010 compared with net outflows of $41.1 billion in 2009.  

Other. Other revenues increased $118 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The results in 2010 included a pre-tax gain of approximately $96 million from the sale of the Companys investment in Invesco (see Notes 5 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). See IntroductionOverview of 2010 Financial Results herein for further information. The increase in 2010 also reflected gains associated with the reduction of a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company and higher revenues associated with the Companys minority stake investments in Avenue Capital Group, a New York-based investment manager, and Lansdowne Partners (Lansdowne), a London-based investment manager. These increases were partially offset by impairment charges of $126 million related to FrontPoint (see Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased 1% in 2010 compared with 2009. The results in 2010 primarily reflected an increase in Compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in Non-compensation expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 2% in 2010 due to certain international tax equalization payments and principal investment gains in the current year related to employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Non-compensation expenses for 2010 included intangible asset impairment charges of $67 million related to certain investment management contracts.  

2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.  

Investment banking revenues decreased 62% in 2009 from fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting lower revenues from real estate products.  

In 2009, the Company recognized Principal transactionTrading losses of $68 million compared with losses of $331 million in fiscal 2008. Trading results in 2009 included mark-to-market losses related to a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company and losses from hedges on certain investments and long-term debt. Losses in 2009 were partially offset by net gains of $164 million related to securities issued by SIVs compared with losses of $470 million in fiscal 2008.  

71  

Table of Contents 

Principal transactions net investment losses of $173 million were recognized in 2009 compared with losses of $1,373 million in fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 were primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys real estate investments and losses related to certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Losses in 2009 were partially offset by net investment gains associated with the Companys alternatives business. The results in fiscal 2008 were primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys merchant banking business, including real estate and private equity investments, and losses related to certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Included in the net investment losses in fiscal 2008 were writedowns of approximately $250 million on Crescent prior to its consolidation.  

Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 25% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflected lower fund management and administration fees, reflecting a decrease in average assets under management. Net flows in 2009 consisted of negative outflows across all asset classes. The Companys decline in assets under management from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 included net customer outflows of $41.1 billion, primarily in the Companys money market, long-term fixed income and equity funds.  

Other revenues decreased 71% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 reflected lower revenues associated with Lansdowne and lower revenues associated with the Companys repurchase of debt.  

Non-interest expenses increased 1% in 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The results in 2009 primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased 17% in 2009, primarily reflecting higher net revenues. Non-compensation expenses decreased 13% in 2009. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 44% in 2009, primarily due to lower fee sharing expenses. Marketing and business development expense decreased 40% in 2009, primarily due to lower levels of business activity. Professional services expense decreased 20% in 2009, primarily due to lower consulting and legal fees.  

One Month Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with the One Month Ended December 31, 2007.  

Asset Management recorded losses from continuing operations before income taxes of $114 million in the one month ended December 31, 2008 compared with losses before income taxes of $103 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007. Net revenues decreased 112% from the prior period. The decrease in the one month ended December 31, 2008 reflected asset management, distribution and administration fees of $112 million compared with $210 million in the prior-year period. This decrease was partially offset by lower losses related to securities issued by SIVs of $84 million compared with $119 million in the one month ended December 31, 2007. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management of $290 billion were down $106 billion, or 27%, from $396 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting decreases in equity and fixed income products resulting from market depreciation and net outflows. Non-interest expenses decreased $76 million to $105 million, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 53%, primarily reflecting lower revenues and reduced headcount.

Accounting Developments.  

Goodwill Impairment Test. 

In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued accounting guidance that modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity shall consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance. This guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2011. The Company does not believe the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  

Other Matters.  

Real Estate.  

The Company acts as the general partner for various real estate funds and also invests in certain of these funds as a limited partner. The Companys real estate investments at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 are described below. Such amounts exclude investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.  

At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the consolidated statements of financial condition include amounts representing real estate investment assets of consolidated subsidiaries of approximately $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, net of noncontrolling interests of approximately $1.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. This net presentation is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess the Companys net exposure. The decrease, net of noncontrolling interests, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 was primarily due to the $1.2 billion write-off in connection with the planned disposition of Revel. In addition, the Company has contractual capital commitments, guarantees, lending facilities and counterparty arrangements with respect to real estate investments of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2010 (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).  

In addition to the Companys real estate investments, the Company engages in various real estate-related activities, including origination of loans secured by commercial and residential properties. The Company also securitizes and trades in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate. In connection with these activities, the Company provides representations and warranties that certain assets sold as whole loans or transferred to securitization transactions conform to certain guidelines. The Company continues to monitor its real estate-related activities in order to manage its exposures and potential liability from these markets and businesses. See Legal ProceedingsResidential Mortgage and Credit Crisis Related Matters in Part I, Item 3.  

A subsidiary of the Company manages an open-ended real estate fund in Germany that suspended redemptions during the global financial crisis in October 2008. In October 2010, the subsidiary announced that it will liquidate the open-ended real estate fund over a period of three years ending September 30, 2013 and distribute proceeds from the sale of real estate assets to its investors. The subsidiary will waive the transaction fees related to the sale of assets but will continue to charge management fees. The Company does not intend to provide any support to the fund.  

See Overview of 2010 Financial ResultsReal Estate Investments herein for further information.  

Securities Available for Sale.  

During the first quarter of 2010, the Company established a portfolio of debt securities in order to manage interest rate risk. The securities have been classified as AFS in accordance with accounting guidance for investments in debt and equity securities and are included within the Global Wealth Management Group business segment.  

    73      

Table of Contents 

During the second quarter of 2010, the Company classified certain marketable equity securities received in connection with the Companys sale of Retail Asset Management to Invesco as AFS securities (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information), included within the Asset Management business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company sold its investment in Invesco, thereby selling all of these equity securities, resulting in a gain of $102 million, recorded within Other revenues in the consolidated statement of income for 2010.  

See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on AFS.  

Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock.  

In December 2007, the Company sold Equity Units that included contracts to purchase Company common stock to a wholly owned subsidiary of CIC. The Company redeemed the junior subordinated debentures underlying the Equity Units in August 2010, and the redemption proceeds were subsequently used by the CIC subsidiary to settle its obligation under the purchase contracts. See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRedemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein.  

Japan Securities Joint Venture.  

On May 1, 2010, the Company and MUFG closed the transaction to form a joint venture in Japan of their respective investment banking and securities businesses. MUFG and the Company have integrated their respective Japanese securities companies by forming two joint venture companies. MUFG contributed the investment banking, wholesale and retail securities businesses conducted in Japan by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co., Ltd. into one of the joint venture entities named Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (MUMSS). The Company contributed the investment banking operations conducted in Japan by its subsidiary, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities, Co., Ltd. (MSMS), formerly known as Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd., into MUMSS (MSMS, together with MUMSS, the Joint Venture). MSMS will continue its sales and trading and capital markets business conducted in Japan. Following the respective contributions to the Joint Venture and a cash payment of 23 billion yen ($247 million) from MUFG to the Company, the Company owns a 40% economic interest in the Joint Venture, and MUFG owns a 60% economic interest in the Joint Venture. The Company holds a 40% voting interest, and MUFG holds a 60% voting interest in MUMSS, while the Company holds a 51% voting interest, and MUFG holds a 49% voting interest in MSMS. The Company continues to consolidate MSMS in its consolidated financial statements and, commencing on May 1, 2010, accounted for its interest in MUMSS as an equity method investment within the Institutional Securities business segment.  

See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview of 2010 Financial ResultsGain on Sale of Noncontrolling Interests herein for further information.  

Dividend Income.  

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company reclassified dividend income associated with trading and investing activities to Principal transactionsTrading or Principal transactionsInvestments depending upon the business activity. Previously, these amounts were included in Interest and dividends on the consolidated statements of income. These reclassifications were made in connection with the Companys conversion to a financial holding company. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.  

Regulatory Outlook.  

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. While certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, other portions will be effective only following extended transition periods. At this time, it is difficult to assess fully the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on the Company and on the financial services industry generally. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will be accomplished through numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act also mandates the preparation of studies on a wide range of issues, which could lead to additional legislation or regulatory changes.  

      74    

Table of Contents 

In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives continue outside the U.S. which may also affect the Companys business and operations. For example, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) has issued new capital, leverage and liquidity standards, known as Basel III, which U.S. banking regulators are expected to introduce in the U.S. The Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee are also developing standards designed to apply to systemically important financial institutions, such as the Company. In addition, initiatives are under way in the European Union and Japan, among other jurisdictions, that would require centralized clearing, reporting and recordkeeping with respect to various kinds of financial transactions and other regulatory requirements that are in some cases similar to those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  

It is likely that the year 2011 and subsequent years will see further material changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which the Company operates, though it is difficult to predict which further reform initiatives will become law, how such reforms will be implemented or the exact impact they will have on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period. See also Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1.  

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.  

Expense. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of an employees pension benefits (including prior-service cost) over the employees estimated service period. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. For fiscal 2008, as required under the alternative transition method set forth in current accounting guidance, the Company changed the measurement date to coincide with the Companys fiscal year-end date.  

On June 1, 2010, the defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the U.S. Qualified Plan) was amended to cease future benefit accruals effective after December 31, 2010. Any benefits earned by participants under the U.S. Qualified Plan at December 31, 2010 will be preserved and will be payable based on the U.S. Qualified Plans provisions. Net periodic pension expense for U.S. and non-U.S. plans was $96 million, $175 million, $132 million and $9 million for 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  

On October 29, 2010, the Morgan Stanley Medical Plan was amended to change eligibility requirements for a firm-provided subsidy toward the cost of retiree medical coverage after December 31, 2010. Net periodic postretirement expense for the Morgan Stanley Medical Plan was $12 million, $26 million, $17 million and $2 million for 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively.  

Contributions. The Company made contributions of $72 million, $321 million, $325 million and $2 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2010, 2009, fiscal 2008 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations.  

The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions to its funded plans by considering several factors, including the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, the types of assets in which the plans are invested, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. The Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws (for example, in the U.S., the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA). At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the U.S. Qualified Plan. Due to cessation of accruals for benefits effective after December 31, 2010, no contribution was made to the U.S. Qualified Plan for 2010. A $278 million contribution was funded to the U.S. Qualified Plan for 2009 based on the service cost earned by the eligible employees plus a portion of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation on a funding basis. Liabilities for benefits payable under certain postretirement and unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries.  

See Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.

Critical Accounting Policies.  

The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  

Fair Value.  

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value. A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value. The Company makes estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include but are not limited to:  

       Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased;  

       Securities available for sale;  

       Securities received as collateral and Obligation to return securities received as collateral;  

       Certain Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, including structured notes;  

       Certain Deposits;  

       Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;  

       Certain Other secured financings; and  

       Certain Long-term borrowings, including structured notes.  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  

In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 uses observable prices in active markets, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs, and, therefore require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, see Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. The Companys Level 3 assets before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $34.9 billion and $43.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and represented approximately 10% and 14% at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, of the assets measured at fair value (4% and 6% of total assets at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively). Level 3 liabilities before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $8.5 billion and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and represented approximately 4% and 9%, respectively, of the Companys liabilities measured at fair value.  

Transfers In/Out of Level 3 during 2010. During 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $3.5 billion of certain Corporate and other debt, primarily loans and hybrid contracts, from Level 3 to Level 2. The Company reclassified these loans and hybrid contracts as external prices and/or spread inputs became observable, and the remaining unobservable inputs were deemed insignificant to the overall measurement. 

76  

Table of Contents 

The Company also reclassified approximately $0.9 billion of certain Corporate and other debt from Level 2 to Level 3. The reclassifications were primarily related to corporate loans and were generally due to a reduction in market price quotations for these or comparable instruments, or a lack of available broker quotes, such that unobservable inputs had to be utilized for the fair value measurement of these instruments.  

During 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $1.2 billion of certain Net derivative contracts from Level 3 to Level 2. These reclassifications were related to certain tranched bespoke basket credit default swaps and single name credit default swaps for which unobservable inputs became insignificant.  

During 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $1 billion of certain Investments from Level 3 to Level 2. The reclassifications were primarily related to principal investments for which external prices became observable.  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis. Certain of the Companys assets were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, goodwill and intangible assets. The Company incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.  

For further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

Fair Value Control Processes. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial Control Group, Market Risk Department and Credit Risk Management Department participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model.  

Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or each party to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more information regarding the Companys risk management practices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.  

Goodwill. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all of the activities of a reporting unit, whether  

77  

Table of Contents 

 acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective book value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the book value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below book value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the Company believes market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair values are generally determined utilizing methodologies that incorporate price-to-book, price-to-earnings and assets under management multiples of certain comparable companies.  

Intangible Assets. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.  

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently when certain events or circumstances exist) for impairment. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.  

See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for intangible asset impairments recorded during 2010.  

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and intangible assets. 

Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies.  

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution.  

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.  

The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Company accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. For certain legal proceedings, the Company can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings, the Company cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek substantial or indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially  

78  

Table of Contents 

 lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.  

The Company is subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits are established as appropriate. The Company establishes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits in accordance with the guidance on accounting for unrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.  

Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. See Notes 13 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings and tax examinations.  

Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities.  

The Companys involvement with special purpose entities (SPE) consists primarily of the following:  

       Transferring financial assets into SPEs;  

       Acting as an underwriter of beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles;  

       Holding one or more classes of securities issued by, or making loans to or investments in, SPEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets;  

       Purchasing and selling (in both a market-making and a proprietary-trading capacity) securities issued by SPEs/variable interest entities (VIE), whether such vehicles are sponsored by the Company or not;  

       Entering into derivative transactions with SPEs (whether or not sponsored by the Company);  

       Providing warehouse financing to collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations;  

       Entering into derivative agreements with non-SPEs whose value is derived from securities issued by SPEs;  

       Servicing assets held by SPEs or holding servicing rights related to assets held by SPEs that are serviced by others under subservicing arrangements;  

       Serving as an asset manager to various investment funds that may invest in securities that are backed, in whole or in part, by SPEs; and  

       Structuring and/or investing in other structured transactions designed to provide enhanced, tax-efficient yields to the Company or its clients.  

The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial instruments. The Companys involvement with SPEs is discussed further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.  

79  

Table of Contents 

In most cases, these SPEs are deemed for accounting purposes to be VIEs. The Company applies accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Entities that previously met the criteria as qualifying SPEs that were not subject to consolidation prior to January 1, 2010 became subject to the consolidation requirements for VIEs on that date. Excluding entities subject to the Deferral (as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), effective January 1, 2010, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that both (1) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIEs economic performance and (2) has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company consolidates entities of which it is the primary beneficiary.  

The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial involvement with the VIE and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the VIE, including the VIEs structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the Company and by other parties and the variable interests owned by the Company and other parties.  

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2010 for transfers of financial assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

The Companys senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. The Companys Treasury Department, Firm Risk Committee (FRC), Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and other control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated statements of financial condition, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Boards Risk Committee.  

The Balance Sheet.  

The Company actively monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in managing the size of its balance sheet. The Companys total assets increased to $807,698 million at December 31, 2010 from $771,462 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in total assets was primarily due to higher interest bearing deposits with banks and financial instruments owned, partially offset by lower securities borrowed.  

The Companys assets and liabilities are primarily related to transactions attributable to sales and trading and securities financing activities. At December 31, 2010, securities financing assets and liabilities were $358 billion and $321 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2009, securities financing assets and liabilities were $376 billion and $316 billion, respectively. Securities financing transactions include repurchase and resale agreements, securities borrowed and loaned transactions, securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received. Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned were $177 billion at December 31, 2010 and averaged $211 billion during 2010, respectively. The period-end balance was lower than the annual average, primarily due to the seasonal maturity of client financing activity on December 31, 2010. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed were $287 billion at December 31, 2010 and averaged $306 billion during 2010, respectively.  

Securities financing assets and liabilities also include matched book transactions with minimal market, credit and/or liquidity risk. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer owned securities, and customer cash, which is segregated according to regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer payables to the Companys prime brokerage clients. The Companys risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit the Companys credit exposure to customers. Included within securities financing assets were $17 billion and $14 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, recorded in accordance with accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets that represented equal and offsetting assets and liabilities for fully collateralized non-cash loan transactions.  

The Company uses the Tier 1 leverage ratio, risk-based capital ratios (see Regulatory Requirements herein), Tier 1 common ratio and the balance sheet leverage ratio as indicators of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of the Companys overall liquidity and capital policies. These ratios are commonly used measures to assess capital adequacy and frequently referred to by investors.  

81  

Table of Contents 

The following table sets forth the Companys total assets and leverage ratios at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and average balances during 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 N/MNot meaningful.  

 (1) The Company calculates its average balances based upon weekly balances, except where weekly balances are unavailable, the month-end balances are used.  

 (2) During 2010, the calculation of average Common equity was adjusted to reflect the common stock issuance corresponding to the redemption of the junior subordinated debentures underlying the CIC Equity Units. See Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein for further information.  

 (3) Goodwill and net intangible assets exclude mortgage servicing rights (net of disallowable mortgage servicing rights) of $141 million and $123 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and include only the Companys share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets.  

 (4) Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, equals common equity less goodwill and net intangible assets as defined above. The Company views tangible common equity as a useful measure to investors because it is a commonly utilized metric and reflects the common equity deployed in the Companys businesses.  

 (5) Leverage ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, equals total assets divided by tangible Morgan Stanley shareholders equity. The Company views the leverage ratio as a useful measure for investors to assess capital adequacy.  

 (6) The Tier 1 common ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, equals Tier 1 common equity divided by Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). The Company defines Tier 1 common equity as Tier 1 capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements, adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with MSSBs noncontrolling interests (i.e., Citis share of MSSBs goodwill and intangibles). The Company views its definition of the Tier 1 common equity as a useful measure for investors as it reflects the actual ownership structure and economics of MSSB. This definition of Tier 1 common equity may evolve in the future as regulatory rules may be implemented based on a final proposal regarding noncontrolling interest (also referred to as minority interest) as initially presented in December 2009 in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Consultative Document Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector (BCBS 164). For a discussion of RWAs and Tier 1 capital, see Regulatory Requirements herein. The year-over-year increase in the Companys Tier 1 Common ratio was primarily driven by net income and the issuance of approximately $5,579 million of common stock corresponding to the redemption of the junior subordinated debentures underlying the CIC Equity Units. Please see Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein for more information.  

Balance Sheet and Funding Activity in 2010.  

During 2010, the Company issued notes with a principal amount of approximately $33 billion. In connection with the note issuances, the Company generally enters into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short-term LIBOR trading levels. The weighted average maturity of the Companys long-term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5.2 years at December 31, 2010. Subsequent to December 31, 2010 and through February 16, 2011, the Companys long-term borrowings (net of repayments) increased by approximately $5 billion.  

82  

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2010, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys senior indebtedness was approximately $183 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries) compared with $179 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in the amount of senior indebtedness was primarily due to new issuances of notes, net of repayments, and an increase in other short-term borrowings, partially offset by maturities.  

Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock.  

In December 2007, the Company sold Equity Units that included contracts to purchase Company common stock to a wholly owned subsidiary of CIC (the CIC Entity) for approximately $5,579 million. On July 1, 2010, Moodys Investor Services announced that it was lowering the equity credit assigned to such Equity Units. The terms of the Equity Units permitted the Company to redeem the junior subordinated debentures underlying the Equity Units upon the occurrence and continuation of such a change in equity credit (a Rating Agency Event). In response to this Rating Agency Event, the Company redeemed the junior subordinated debentures in August 2010 and the redemption proceeds were subsequently used by the CIC Entity to settle its obligation under the purchase contracts. The settlement of the purchase contracts and delivery of 116,062,911 shares of Company common stock to the CIC Entity occurred in August 2010.  

Capital Management Policies.  

The Companys senior management views capital as an important source of financial strength. The Company actively manages its consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity.  

At December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $1.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program out of the $6 billion authorized by the Board in December 2006. The share repurchase program is for capital management purposes and considers, among other things, business segment capital needs as well as equity-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases by the Company are subject to regulatory approval. During 2010, the Company did not repurchase common stock as part of its capital management share repurchase program (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5).  

The Board determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In January 2011, the Company announced that its Board declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.05. The Company also announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $255.56 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.25556); a quarterly dividend of $25.00 per share of Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock and a quarterly dividend of $25.00 per share of Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock.  

Required Capital.  

Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2010, the Companys capital estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. This framework is a risk-based internal use of capital measure, which is compared with the Companys regulatory Tier 1 capital to help ensure the Company maintains an amount of risk-based going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from extreme stress events at a point in time. The difference between the Companys Tier 1 capital and aggregate Required Capital is the Companys Parent capital. Average Tier 1 capital, Required Capital and Parent capital for 2010 was approximately $51.6 billion, $30.9 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively. The Company generally holds Parent capital for prospective regulatory requirements, including Basel III, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.  

83  

Table of Contents 

Tier 1 capital and common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by Required Capital. In principle, each business segment is capitalized as if it were an independent operating entity with limited diversification benefit between the business segments. Required Capital is assessed at each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The Required Capital framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment, including Basel III, and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques (see Regulatory Requirements herein for further information on Basel III).  

For a further discussion of the Companys Tier 1 capital, see Regulatory Requirements herein.  

The following table presents the Companys and business segments average Tier 1 capital and average common equity for 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) The computation of Average common equity and Tier 1 capital is determined using the Companys Required Capital Framework. Business segment capital prior to 2010 was computed under a previous framework and has not been restated under the Required Capital Framework. As a result, the business segment Tier 1 Capital and average common equity prior to 2010 is not directly comparable. The Required Capital framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques.  

Capital Covenants.  

In October 2006 and April 2007, the Company executed replacement capital covenants in connection with offerings by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII (the Capital Securities), which become effective after the scheduled redemption date in 2046. Under the terms of the replacement capital covenants, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of certain specified holders of debt, to limitations on its ability to redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities for specified periods of time. For a complete description of the Capital Securities and the terms of the replacement capital covenants, see the Companys Current Reports on Form 8-K dated October 12, 2006 and April 26, 2007.  

Liquidity and Funding Management Policies.  

The primary goal of the Companys liquidity management and funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market conditions. Given the mix of the Companys business activities, funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of secured and unsecured financing.  

The Companys liquidity and funding risk management framework, including policies and governance structure, helps mitigate the potential risk that the Company may not have access to adequate financing. The framework is designed to help ensure that the Company fulfills its financial obligations and to support the execution of the  

84  

Table of Contents 

 Companys business strategies. The principal elements of the Companys liquidity and funding risk management framework are the Contingency Funding Plan and the Global Liquidity Reserve that support the target liquidity profile (see Contingency Funding Plan and Global Liquidity Reserve herein).  

Contingency Funding Plan.  

The Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) is the Companys primary liquidity and funding risk management tool. The CFP outlines the Companys response to liquidity stress in the markets and incorporates stress testing to identify potential liquidity risk. Liquidity stress tests model multiple scenarios related to idiosyncratic, systemic or a combination of both types of events across various time horizons. Based on the results of stress testing, the CFP sets forth a course of action to effectively manage through a stressed liquidity event.  

The Companys CFP incorporates a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following:  

       No government support;  

       No access to unsecured debt markets;  

       Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year;  

       Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding;  

       Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties and certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to multi-notch credit rating downgrades;  

       Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;  

       Drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties;  

       Client cash withdrawals;  

       Limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets;  

       Return of securities borrowed on an uncollateralized basis; and  

       Maturity roll-off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance.  

The CFP is produced at the Parent and major operating subsidiary levels, as well as at major currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Company. The CFP assumes the subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent company. The CFP also assumes that the Parent will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to their liquidity reserves due to regulatory, legal or tax constraints.  

At December 31, 2010, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet funding and contingent obligations as modeled in its liquidity stress tests.  

Global Liquidity Reserve.  

The Company maintains sufficient liquidity reserves (Global Liquidity Reserve) to cover daily funding needs and meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the CFP. The Global Liquidity Reserve is held within the Parent company and major operating subsidiaries. It is comprised of cash and cash equivalents, securities that have been reversed or borrowed by the Company primarily on an overnight basis (predominantly consisting of U.S. and European government bonds and U.S. agency and agency mortgage-backed securities) and pools of Federal Reserve-eligible (eligible to be pledged to the Federal Reserves Discount Window) securities (see table below). The assets that make up the Global Liquidity Reserve are all unencumbered and are not pledged as collateral on either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. They do not include other unencumbered assets that are available to the Company for additional monetization.

Global Liquidity Reserve by Type of Investment  

The table below summarizes the Companys Global Liquidity Reserve by type of investment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The vast majority of the assets held in the Global Liquidity Reserve can be monetized on a next-day basis in a stressed environment given the highly liquid and diversified nature of the reserves. The remainder of the assets can be monetized within two to five business days.  

The currency composition of the Global Liquidity Reserve is consistent with the CFP on a currency level. The Companys funding requirements and target liquidity reserves may vary based on changes to the level and composition of its balance sheet, subsidiary funding needs, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors.  

Global Liquidity Reserve Held by the Parent and Subsidiaries  

The table below summarizes the Global Liquidity Reserve held by the Parent and subsidiaries:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) The Company calculates the average global liquidity reserve based upon weekly amounts.  

The Company is exposed to intra-day settlement risk in connection with liquidity provided to its major broker-dealer subsidiaries for intra-day clearing and settlement of its securities and financing activity.  

Funding Management Policies.  

The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period.  

The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include the Companys equity capital, long-term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, commercial paper, letters of credit and lines of credit. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen.  

Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term collateralized receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with collateralized borrowings.  

86  

Table of Contents 

The Companys goal is to achieve an optimal mix of secured and unsecured funding while ensuring continued growth in stable funding sources. The Institutional Securities business segment emphasizes the use of collateralized short-term borrowings to limit the growth of short-term unsecured funding, which is generally more subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. The ability to fund less liquid assets on a secured basis may be impaired in a stress environment. To manage this risk, the Company obtains longer-term secured financing for less liquid assets and has minimal reliance on overnight financing. In addition, the Company holds a portion of its Global Liquidity Reserve against a potential disruption to its secured financing capabilities. This potential disruption may be in the form of additional margin or reduced capacity to refinance maturing trades. The Company continues to extend the tenor of secured financing for less liquid collateral and seeks to build a sufficient buffer to offset the risks discussed above.  

Unsecured Financing. The Company views long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding for core inventories and less liquid assets. Securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate and deposits. The Company uses derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management and to hedge interest rate risk (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). In October 2008, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury invoked the systemic risk exception of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, and the FDIC announced the TLGP. Based on the Final Rule adopted on November 21, 2008, the TLGP provides a guarantee, through the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, of certain senior unsecured debt issued by participating Eligible Entities (including the Company) between October 14, 2008 and June 30, 2009. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company had $21.3 billion and $23.8 billion, respectively, of senior unsecured debt outstanding under the TLGP. There have been no issuances under the TLGP since March 31, 2009. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on commercial paper and long-term borrowings.  

Short-Term Borrowings. The Companys unsecured short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper, bank loans, bank notes and structured notes with maturities of 12 months or less at issuance.  

The table below summarizes the Companys short-term unsecured borrowings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Deposits. The Companys bank subsidiaries funding sources include bank deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, certificates of deposit, money market deposit accounts, commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  

Deposits were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

87  

Table of Contents 

 (1) Total deposits insured by the FDIC at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were $48 billion and $46 billion, respectively.  

 (2) Certain time deposit accounts are carried at fair value under the fair value option (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  

With the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the statutory standard maximum deposit insurance amount was permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor and is in effect for the Companys relevant U.S. subsidiary banks.  

On November 9, 2010, the FDIC issued a Final Rule implementing Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act that provides for unlimited insurance coverage of non-interest bearing transaction accounts. Beginning December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012, all non-interest bearing transaction accounts are fully insured, regardless of the balance of the account, at all FDIC-insured institutions, including the Companys FDIC-insured subsidiaries. This unlimited insurance coverage is available to all depositors and is separate from, and in addition to, the insurance coverage provided to a depositors other deposit accounts held at an FDIC-insured institution. Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDA) and Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts are not eligible for this unlimited insurance coverage, regardless of the interest rate, even if no interest is paid on the account.  

Long-Term Borrowings. The Company uses a variety of long-term debt funding sources to generate liquidity, taking CFP requirements into consideration. In addition, the issuance of long-term debt allows the Company to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short-term borrowings). Long-term borrowings are generally structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients. Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. During 2010, the Company issued notes with a principal amount of approximately $33 billion.  

The Company may from time to time engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt repurchases) that it believes are in the best interests of the Company and its investors. During 2010, approximately $34 billion in aggregate long-term borrowings matured.  

Long-term borrowings at December 31, 2010 consisted of the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long-term borrowings.  

Credit Ratings.  

The Company relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally is impacted by the Companys credit ratings. In addition, the Companys credit ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Factors that are important to the determination of the Companys credit ratings include the level and quality of earnings, capital adequacy, liquidity, risk appetite and management, asset quality, business mix and perceived levels of government support.  

88  

Table of Contents 

The rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of uplift from perceived government support in the credit ratings of systemically important banks, including the credit ratings of the Company. The U.S. financial reform legislation has rating agencies reviewing their methodologies and may be seen as limiting the possibility of extraordinary government support for the financial system in any future financial crises. This may lead to reduced uplift assumptions for U.S. banks and thereby place downward pressure on credit ratings. At the same time, the U.S. financial reform legislation also has credit ratings positive features such as higher standards for capital and liquidity levels. The net result on credit ratings and the timing of any rating agency actions is currently uncertain (see Other MattersRegulatory Outlook herein).  

In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, the Company may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade. At December 31, 2010, the amount of additional collateral or termination payments that could be called by counterparties under the terms of such agreements in the event of a one-notch downgrade of the Companys long-term credit rating was $1,516 million. A total of $3,701 million in collateral or termination payments could be called in the event of a two-notch downgrade.  

Also, the Company is required to pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. At December 31, 2010, the increased collateral requirement at certain exchanges and clearing organizations was $173 million in the event of a one-notch downgrade of the Companys long-term credit rating. A total of $1,446 million of collateral is required in the event of a two-notch downgrade.  

The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is accounted for in the Companys CFP.  

At January 31, 2011, the Companys and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.s senior unsecured ratings were as set forth below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In September 2010, Fitch Ratings downgraded Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.s rating to A, and this downgrade had no impact on the operations of Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. or the Company as a whole. As the rating outlook of Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. is Stable, the Company does not expect this downgrade to have any future impact on operations.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements with Unconsolidated Entities.  

The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities business segment.  

Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial

Table of Contents 

 condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets were approximately $5.4 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, substantially all of which were related to U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage loan and residential mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.  

The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).  

Asset Management Activities. As a general partner in certain private equity and real estate partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.  

Guarantees. Accounting guidance for guarantees requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. The FASB defines guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. The FASB also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.  

The table below summarizes certain information regarding the Companys obligations under guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Carrying amount of derivative contracts are shown on a gross basis prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting. For further information on derivative contracts, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (2) Amounts include a guarantee to investors in undivided participating interests in claims the Company made against a derivative counterparty that filed for bankruptcy protection. To the extent, in the future, any portion of the claims is disallowed or reduced by the bankruptcy court in excess of a certain amount, then the Company must refund a portion of the purchase price plus interest. For further information, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (3) Approximately $2.2 billion of standby letters of credit are also reflected in the Commitments table in primary and secondary lending commitments. Standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value within Financial instruments owned or Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated statements of financial condition.  

90  

Table of Contents 

 (4) Amounts include guarantees issued by consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company of approximately $465 million. These guarantees relate to obligations of the funds investee entities, including guarantees related to capital expenditures and principal and interest debt payments. Accrued losses under these guarantees of approximately $161 million are reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of the related fund investments, which are reflected in Financial instruments ownedInvestments on the consolidated statement of financial condition.  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements.  

See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information on other guarantees and indemnities.  

Commitments and Contractual Obligations.  

The Companys commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees obtained to satisfy collateral requirements, investment activities, corporate lending and financing arrangements, mortgage lending and margin lending at December 31, 2010 are summarized below by period of expiration. Since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) These commitments are recorded at fair value within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated statements of financial condition (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 (2) This amount includes commitments to asset-backed commercial paper conduits of $275 million at December 31, 2010, of which $138 million have maturities of less than one year and $137 million of which have maturities of one to three years.  

 (3) The Company enters into forward starting securities purchased under agreements to resell (agreements that have a trade date at or prior to December 31, 2010 and settle subsequent to period-end) that are primarily secured by collateral from U.S. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations. These agreements primarily settle within three business days and at December 31, 2010, $45.2 billion of the $53.0 billion settled within three business days.

For further description of these commitments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein.  

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations include long-term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases, purchase obligations and expected contributions for pension and postretirement plans. The Companys future cash payments associated with certain of its obligations at December 31, 2010 are summarized below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented for Other secured financings are financings with original maturities greater than one year.  

 (2) Amounts represent estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings and secured long-term financings based on applicable interest rates at December 31, 2010. Amounts include stated coupon rates, if any, on structured or index-linked notes.  

 (3) Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments related to time deposits primarily held at the Companys Subsidiary Banks.  

 (4) See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (5) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, advertising, sponsorship, computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements, certain license agreements related to MSSB, and certain transmission, transportation and storage contracts related to the commodities business. Purchase obligations at December 31, 2010 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition.  

 (6) See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.  

 (7) Amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable at this time (see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information).  

Regulatory Requirements.  

The Company is a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the Companys compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Companys national bank subsidiaries. See Supervision and RegulationFinancial Holding Company in Part I, Item 1 and Other MattersRegulatory Outlook herein.  

The Company calculates its capital ratios and RWAs in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve. These standards are based upon a framework described in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I. In December 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published final U.S. implementing regulation incorporating the Basel II Accord, which requires internationally active banking organizations, as well as certain of their U.S. bank subsidiaries, to implement Basel II standards over the next several years. The timeline set out in December 2007 for the implementation of Basel II in the U.S. may be  

92  

Table of Contents 

 impacted by the developments concerning Basel III described below. Starting July 2010, the Company has been reporting on a parallel basis under the current regulatory capital regime (Basel I) and Basel II. During the parallel run period, the Company continues to be subject to Basel I but simultaneously calculates its risks under Basel II. The Company reports the capital ratios under both of these standards to the regulators. There will be at least four quarters of parallel reporting before the Company enters the three-year transitional period to implement Basel II standards. Under provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, the generally applicable capital standards, which are currently based on Basel I standards, but may themselves change over time, would serve as a permanent floor to minimum capital requirements calculated under the Basel II standards the Company is currently required to implement, as well as future capital standards.  

Basel III contains new capital standards that raise the quality of capital, strengthen counterparty credit risk capital requirements and introduces a leverage ratio as a supplemental measure to the risk-based ratio. Basel III also includes a new capital conservation buffer, which imposes a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress, subject to restrictions on capital distributions, and a new countercyclical buffer, which regulators can activate during periods of excessive credit growth in their jurisdiction. The Basel III proposals complement an earlier proposal for revisions to Market Risk Framework that increases capital requirements for securitizations within the trading book. The U.S. regulators will require implementation of Basel III subject to an extended phase-in period.  

Under the Basel Committees proposed framework, based on a preliminary analysis of the guidelines published to date, the Company estimates its RWAs at December 31, 2010 could increase by approximately $240 billion, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $100 billion related to runoff and mitigation opportunities by the end of 2012. The net increase in RWAs is estimated to be $140 billion, or approximately 43%, primarily driven by higher market risk for securitization, structured credit and correlation products and credit risk for counterparty exposures. These are preliminary estimates and they will likely change based on guidelines for implementation to be issued by the Federal Reserve.  

The proposed framework includes new standards to raise the quality of capital which may impact the components of Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity. The Company currently defines Tier 1 common equity as Tier 1 capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying restricted core capital elements (including junior subordinated debt issued to trusts (trust preferred securities) and noncontrolling interest), adjusted for the portion of goodwill and non-servicing intangible assets associated with MSSBs noncontrolling interests (i.e., Citis share of MSSBs goodwill and intangibles). This definition of Tier 1 common equity may evolve in the future as regulatory rules may be implemented based on a final proposal regarding noncontrolling interest as initially presented by the Basel Committee. For the discussion of Tier 1 common equity, please see The Balance Sheet herein.  

Pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, over time, the trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital but will qualify only as Tier 2 capital. This change in regulatory capital treatment will be phased in incrementally during a transition period that will start on January 1, 2013 and end on January 1, 2016. This provision of the Dodd-Frank Act accelerates the phasing in of the disqualification of the trust preferred securities as provided for by Basel III. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $4.7 billion of trust preferred securities included in the qualifying restricted core capital elements. Effective March 31, 2011, the Federal Reserve will institute a limit on restricted core capital elements that are included in Tier 1 capital. Amounts in excess of the stated limit will be included in Tier 2 capital.  

At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with Basel I capital requirements with ratios of Tier 1 capital to RWAs of 16.1% and total capital to RWAs of 16.5% (6% and 10% being well-capitalized for regulatory purposes, respectively). In addition, financial holding companies are also subject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve. The Company calculated its Tier 1 leverage ratio as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets (which reflects adjustments for disallowed goodwill, certain intangible assets, deferred tax assets and financial and non-financial equity investments). The adjusted average total assets are derived using weekly balances for the year.

Table of Contents 

The following table reconciles the Companys total shareholders equity to Tier 1 and Total capital as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and presents the Companys consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total allowable capital is composed of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists predominately of common shareholders equity as well as qualifying preferred stock, trust preferred securities mandatorily convertible to common equity (see Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein for further information) and qualifying restricted core capital elements (trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests) less goodwill, non-servicing intangible assets (excluding allowable mortgage servicing rights), net deferred tax assets (recoverable in excess of one year), an after-tax debt valuation adjustment and certain other deductions, including equity investments. The debt valuation adjustment in the above table represents the cumulative change in fair value of certain long-term and short-term borrowings that was attributable to the Companys own instrument specific credit spreads and is included in retained earnings. For a further discussion of fair value, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2010, the Company redeemed the junior subordinated debentures underlying the Equity Units and issued 116 million shares of common stock to the CIC Entity (see Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein for further information). At December 31, 2010, the Company had no trust preferred securities mandatorily convertible to common equity outstanding.  

94  

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2010, the Company calculated its RWAs in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements of the Federal Reserve, which is consistent with guidelines described under Basel I. RWAs reflect both on and off-balance sheet risk of the Company. The risk capital calculations will evolve over time as the Company enhances its risk management methodology and incorporates improvements in modeling techniques while maintaining compliance with the regulatory requirements and interpretations.  

Market RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and other factors. For a further discussion of the Companys market risks and Value-at-Risk (VaR) model, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. Market RWAs incorporate two components: systematic risk and specific risk. Systematic and specific risk charges are computed using either the Companys VaR model or Standardized Approach in accordance with regulatory requirements.  

Credit RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its financial obligations. For a further discussion of the Companys credit risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCredit Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein.  

Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.  

The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability.  

A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows.
