Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in millions) 

 General 

 During 2010, the Company continued to strengthen its financial performance through pricing discipline, continued growth of its esoteric testing, outcome improvement and companion diagnostics offerings, and expense control. 

 On December 1, 2010, the Company acquired Genzyme Genetics, a business unit of Genzyme Corporation, for approximately $925.2 in cash (net of cash acquired). The Genzyme Genetics acquisition was made to expand the Company’s capabilities in reproductive, genetic, hematology-oncology and clinical trials central laboratory testing, enhance the Company’s esoteric testing capabilities and advance the Company’s personalized medicine strategy. 

 On October 28, 2010, in conjunction with the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics, the Company entered into a $925.0 bridge term loan credit agreement. The Company replaced and terminated the bridge term loan credit agreement in November 2010 by making an offering in the debt capital markets. On November 19, 2010, the Company sold $925.0 in debt securities, consisting of $325.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due May 15, 2016 and $600.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due November 15, 2020. As of December 31, 2010 the Company incurred $7.0 of financing commitment fees, which is included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010. 

 The Company incurred approximately $25.7 in professional fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics and other acquisition activity, including significant costs associated with the Federal Trade Commission’s review of the Company’s purchase of specified net assets of Westcliff Medical Laboratories, Inc. These fees and expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010. 

 Due to the normal post-acquisition enrollment process for government payers and contract assignment process for managed care payers, the Company will experience delays in billing for services rendered by Genzyme Genetics. Cash collections, receivable agings and DSO in the first quarter of 2011 will be negatively impacted by these delays. The Company expects the delays to be resolved in due course and the related billings and collections will be brought up-to-date during the second quarter of 2011. The acquisition of Genzyme Genetics is expected to be approximately $0.25 to $0.35 dilutive to the Company’s earnings per share in 2011. 

 Effective January 1, 2008 the Company acquired additional partnership units in its Ontario, Canada (“Ontario”) joint venture for approximately $140.9 in cash (net of cash acquired), bringing the Company’s percentage interest owned to 85.6%. Concurrent with this acquisition, the terms of the joint venture’s partnership agreement were amended. Based upon the amended terms of this agreement, the Company began including the consolidated operating results, financial position and cash flows of the Ontario joint venture in the Company’s consolidated financial statements on January 1, 2008. The amended joint venture’s partnership agreement also enabled the holders of the noncontrolling interest to put the remaining partnership units to the Company in defined future periods, at a n initial amount equal to the consideration paid by the Company in 2008, and subject to adjustment based on market value formulas contained in the agreement. In December 2009, the Company received notification from the holders of the noncontrolling interest in the Ontario joint venture that they intended to put their remaining partnership units to the Company in accordance with the terms of the joint venture’s partnership agreement. These units were acquired on February 8, 2010 for $137.5. On February 17, 2010, the Company completed a transaction to sell the units acquired from the previous noncontrolling interest holder to a new Canadian partner for the same price. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a component of noncontrolling interest in other liabilities and a component in mezzanine equity. Upon the completion of these two transactions, the Company’s financial ownership percentage in the joint venture partnership remained unchanged at 85.6%. Concurrent with the sale to the new partner, the partnership agreement for the Ontario joint venture was amended and restated with substantially the same terms as the previous agreement. The contractual value of these puts, in excess of the current noncontrolling interest of $25.2, totaled $143.5 at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, $148.1 

42 

has been classified as a current liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as the noncontrolling interest that acquired these units has the ability to put its units in the partnership to the Company on December 31, 2011. 

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company commenced its successful implementation of its ten-year agreement with United Healthcare Insurance Company (“UnitedHealthcare”) and became its exclusive national laboratory provider. During the first three years of the ten-year agreement, the Company committed to reimburse UnitedHealthcare up to $200.0 for transition costs related to developing expanded networks in defined markets during the first three years of the agreement. At the end of the reimbursement period, approximately $119.6 of such transition payments have been billed to the Company by UnitedHealthcare and approximately $119.6 has been remitted by the Company. UnitedHealthcare has indicated that there will be no further billings. The Company is amortizing the total transition costs over the li fe of the contract. 

Seasonality 

 The majority of the Company’s testing volume is dependent on patient visits to doctor’s offices and other providers of health care. Volume of testing generally declines during the year-end holiday periods and other major holidays. In addition, volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year. 

Results of Operations (amounts in millions except Revenue Per Requisition info) 

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 

 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by severe winter weather primarily in the eastern and middle sections of the country during the first quarter of 2010. The Company’s testing facilities were not damaged by the severe winter weather; however, specimen volume was negatively impacted due to patients’ inability to visit doctors’ offices and PSCs – the sources of the majority of testing volume. During the year ended December 31, 2010 inclement weather had an impact on the Company’s results, reducing volumes by an estimated 0.3%, and revenue by an estimated $23.0. 

Net Sales 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

43 

 The increase in net sales for the three years ended December 31, 2010 has been driven primarily by growth in the Company’s managed care business, increased revenue from third parties (Medicare and Medicaid), the Company’s continued shift in test mix to higher-priced genomic and esoteric tests, growth in revenue per requisition in the Company’s routine testing and the impact of acquisitions. Managed care and third party revenue as a percentage of net sales increased from 59.7% in 2008 to 61.5% in 2010. Genomic and esoteric testing volume as a percentage of total volume increased from 20.1% in 2008 to 22.8% in 2010. The continuing impact of government contracts terminated during 2009 reduced routine testing volume by 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Revenue per requisition growth was impacted by lost contracts and the recognition of deferred revenue resulting from an amendment to a customer contract, which together improved revenue per requisition by approximately 1.6% in 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $7.5 cumulative revenue adjustment relating to certain historic overpayments made by Medicare for claims submitted by a subsidiary of the Company that was acquired in 2005. Net sales of the Ontario joint venture were $280.0, $247.5 and $249.0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of $32.5 or 13.1% in 2010 and a decrease of $1.5 or 0.6% in 2009. Net sales for the Ontario joint venture were impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar in 2010 and a stronger U.S. dollar in 2009. In Canadian dollars, net sales of the Ontario joint venture increased by CN$7.2 or 2.6% in 2010 and CN$16.9 or 6.4% in 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Cost of sales (primarily laboratory and distribution costs) has increased over the three year period ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to increases in labor, growth in the Company’s Managed Care and third party (Medicare and Medicaid) business, the continued shift in test mix to higher cost genomic and esoteric testing and the impact of acquisitions. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales has decreased during the three year period ended December 31, 2010 from 58.4% in 2008 to 58.1% in 2010. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was comparable for 2010 and 2009. The Company’s improved efficiency resulting from lab and PSC automation was offset by lower margins on recently acquired operations that have not been fully integrated into the Company’s operating cost structure as of Dec ember 31, 2010. The percentage of cost of sales was maintained even though the Company experienced the loss of revenue as a result of the severe winter weather during the first quarter of 2010. The decrease in cost of sales from 2008 to 2009 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to operating efficiencies and effective expense controls coupled with the growth of revenue per requisition. Labor and testing supplies comprise over 75% of the Company’s cost of sales. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Total selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) as a percentage of sales over the three year period ended December 31, 2010 have ranged from 20.4% to 20.8%. Bad debt expense decreased to 4.8% of net sales in 2010 as compared with 5.3% and 6.2% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower bad debt expense as a percentage of net sales in 2010 and 2009 is primarily due to improved collection trends resulting from process improvement programs within the Company’s billing department and field operations. The higher level of bad debt expense in 2008 was primarily due to the increase in the second quarter of 2008 of $45.0 in the Company’s provision for doubtful accounts. The Company’s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased in 2008 due to the impact of the economy, higher patient deductibles and copayments, and acquisitions on the collectibility of accounts receivable balances. 

 The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales in 2010 as compared with 2009 is primarily due to acquisition related transaction costs of $25.7 in 2010, expenses from recently acquired operations that have not been fully integrated into the Company’s operating cost structure as of December 31, 2010 and 

44 

the loss of revenue as a result of the severe winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2010. In 2009, SG&A included Monogram’s incremental SG&A beginning in August 2009 and acquisition related costs of $2.7 in connection with the Monogram acquisition. As a result of changes to the Company’s defined benefit retirement plan and its PEP which were adopted in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a net curtailment charge of $2.8 due to remeasurement of the PEP obligation at December 31, 2009 and the acceleration of unrecognized prior service for that plan. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded charges of $3.7 related to the acceleration of the recognition of stock compensation and certain defined benefit plan obligations due to the retirement of the Company’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs which was effective December 31, 2008. 

Amortization of Intangibles and Other Assets 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The increase in amortization of intangibles and other assets over the three year period ended December 31, 2010 primarily reflects certain acquisitions closed during 2010 and 2009. 

Restructuring and Other Special Charges 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 During 2010, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $5.8 primarily related to work force reductions and the closing of redundant and underutilized facilities. The majority of these costs related to severance and other employee costs and contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and other facility related costs. Of this amount, $8.0 related to severance and other employee costs in connection with certain work force reductions and $3.1 related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and other facility related costs. These restructuring initiatives are expected to provide annualized cost savings of approximately $34.7. The Company also reduced its prior restructuring accruals by $5.3, comprised of $4.7 of previously recorded facility costs and $0.6 of employee s everance benefits as a result of changes in cost estimates on the restructuring initiatives. In addition, the Company recorded a special charge of $6.2 related to the write-off of development costs incurred on systems abandoned during the year. 

 During 2009, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $13.5 primarily related to the closing of redundant and underutilized facilities. The majority of these costs related to severance and other employee costs and contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and other facility related costs. Of this amount, $10.5 related to severance and other employee costs for employees primarily in the affected facilities, and $12.5 related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and other facility related costs. The Company also reduced its prior restructuring accruals by $9.5, comprised of $7.3 of previously recorded facility costs and $2.2 of employee severance benefits as a result of incurring less cost than planned on those restructuring initiatives primarily resulting fro m favorable settlements on lease buyouts and severance payments that were not required to achieve the planned reduction in work force. 

 During 2008, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $32.4 primarily related to work force reductions and the closing of redundant and underutilized facilities. Of this amount, $20.9 related to severance and other employee costs in connection with the general work force reductions and $13.4 related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment. The Company also recorded a credit of $1.9, comprised of $1.2 of previously recorded facility costs and $0.7 of employee severance benefits relating to changes in cost estimates accrued in prior periods. 

 During the third quarter of 2008, the Company also recorded a special charge of $5.5 related to estimated uncollectible amounts primarily owed by patients in the areas of the Gulf Coast severely impacted by hurricanes similar to losses incurred during the 2005 hurricane season. 

45 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The increase in interest expense for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to the Company incurring $7.0 of bridge financing fees related to the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics and interest incurred since November 2010 on proceeds from the senior notes offerings of $925.0. Other interest related costs decreased due to lower average borrowings outstanding in 2010 as compared with 2009 primarily due to principal payments on the Term Loan Facility. The decrease in interest expense for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily driven by lower average borrowings outstanding in 2009 due to principal payments on the Term Loan Facility and the redemption of approximately 50% of the zero-coupon subordinated notes in the second quarter of 2009. Also, the Company’s zero-coupon subordinated notes did not accru e contingent cash interest for the period March 12, 2009 through December 31, 2009. 

Equity Method Income 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Equity method income represents the Company’s ownership share in joint venture partnerships along with stock investments in other companies in the clinical diagnostic industry. The decrease in income since 2008 is primarily due to the Company’s share of losses in the Cincinnati, Ohio joint venture and the Canada, China and Western Europe equity method investment. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The effective tax rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by a benefit relating to the net decrease in unrecognized income tax benefits. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by adjustments of $21.5 relating to the resolution of certain state tax issues under audit, as well as the realization of foreign tax credits. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position 

 The Company’s strong cash-generating capability and financial condition typically have provided ready access to capital markets. The Company’s principal source of liquidity is operating cash flow, supplemented by proceeds from debt offerings. This cash-generating capability is one of the Company’s fundamental strengths and provides substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating, investing and financing needs. The Company’s senior unsecured credit facilities are further discussed in "Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements." 

Operating Activities 

 In 2010, the Company’s operations provided $883.6 of cash, net of $16.8 in transition payments to UnitedHealthcare, reflecting the Company’s solid business results. The increase in the Company’s cash flow from operations primarily resulted from lower transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. The Company continued to focus on efforts to increase cash collections from all payers and to generate on-going improvements to the claim submission processes. 

 The Company made contributions to the defined benefit retirement plan (“Company Plan”) of $0.0, $54.8 and $0.0 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In October 2009, the Company received approval from its Board of Directors to freeze any additional service-based credits for any years of service after December 31, 2009 on the Company Plan and the PEP. Both plans have been closed to new participants. Employees participating in the Company Plan and the PEP no longer earn service-based credits, but 

46 

continue to earn interest credits. In addition, effective January 1, 2010, all employees eligible for the defined contribution retirement plan (the “401K Plan”) receive a minimum 3% non-elective contribution (“NEC”) concurrent with each payroll period. The NEC replaces the Company match, which has been discontinued. Employees are not required to make a contribution to the 401K Plan to receive the NEC. The NEC is non-forfeitable and vests immediately. The 401K Plan also permits discretionary contributions by the Company of 1% to 3% of pay for eligible employees based on service. Non-elective and discretionary contributions are approximately $25.4 higher in 2010 than the Company’s contributions to its 401K Plan in 2009. 

 Projected pension expense for the Company Plan and PEP is expected to decrease from $9.6 in 2010 to $8.9 in 2011. In addition, the Company does not plan to make contributions to the Company Plan during 2011. See “Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further discussion of the Company’s pension and postretirement plans. 

Investing Activities 

 Capital expenditures were $126.1, $114.7 and $156.7 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $140.0 to $150.0 in 2011. The Company will continue to make important investments in its business, including information technology. Such expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations, as well as borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facilities as needed. 

 The Company remains committed to growing its business through strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements. The Company has invested a total of $1,738.7 over the past three years in strategic business acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped strengthen the Company’s geographic presence along with expanding capabilities in the specialty testing operations. The Company believes the acquisition market remains attractive with a number of opportunities to strengthen its scientific capabilities, grow esoteric testing capabilities and increase presence in key geographic areas. 

 The Company has invested a total of $50.6 over the past three years in licensing new testing technologies (including approximately $49.4 estimated fair market value of technology acquired in certain acquisitions in 2010 and 2009) and had $69.0 net book value of capitalized patents, licenses and technology at December 31, 2010. While the Company continues to believe its strategy of entering into licensing and technology distribution agreements with the developers of leading-edge technologies will provide future growth in revenues, there are certain risks associated with these investments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the failure of the licensed technology to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace and/or that insurance companies, managed care organizations, or Medicare and Medicaid will not approve reimbursement for these tests at a level commensurate with the costs of running the tests. Any or all of these circumstances could result in impairment in the value of the related capitalized licensing costs. 

Financing Activities 

 On October 26, 2007, the Company entered into senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $1,000.0. The credit facilities consist of a five-year Revolving Facility in the principal amount of $500.0 and a five-year, $500.0 Term Loan Facility. The balances outstanding on the Company’s Term Loan Facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $375.0 and $425.0, respectively. The balances outstanding on the Company’s Revolving Facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $0.0 and $75.0, respectively. The senior unsecured credit facilities bear interest at varying rates based upon LIBOR plus a percentage based on the Company’s credit rating with Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. 

 The senior credit facilities contain certain debt covenants, which require that the Company maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 2.5 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 5.0 to 1.0. Both ratios are calculated in relation to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). The credit agreement allows payment of dividends provided that the Company is not in default (as defined in the agreement) and its leverage ratio is less than 2.0 to 1.0. The Company is in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010. 

47 

 On March 31, 2008, the Company entered into a three-year interest rate swap agreement to hedge variable interest rate risk on the Company’s variable interest rate term loan. On a quarterly basis under the swap, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest (2.92%) and receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR rate on an amortizing notional amount of indebtedness equivalent to the term loan balance outstanding. The swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the fair value of the swap in the consolidated balance sheets and any changes in the fair value are recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is the estimated amount that the Company would pay or receive to terminate the swap agreement at the reporting date. The fair value of the swap was a liability of $2.4 and $10.6 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 

 As of December 31, 2010, the interest rates on the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility were 3.67% and 0.61%, respectively. 

 On October 28, 2010, in conjunction with the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics, the Company entered into a $925.0 Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement, among the Company, the lenders named therein and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Bridge Facility”). The Company replaced and terminated the Bridge Facility in November 2010 by making an offering in the debt capital markets. On November 19, 2010, the Company sold $925.0 in debt securities, consisting of $325.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due May 15, 2016 and $600.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due November 15, 2020. Beginning on May 15, 2011, interest on the Senior Notes due 2016 and 2020 is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. On December 1, 2010, the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics was funded by the proceeds from the issuance of these Notes ($915.4) and with cash on hand. 

 During 2010, the Company repurchased $337.5 of stock representing 4.5 shares. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding authorization from the Board of Directors to purchase approximately $234.3 of Company common stock. During January 2011, the Company completed its repurchase authorization, representing approximately 2.6 shares of its common stock. On February 10, 2011, the Company announced the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of $500.0 of additional shares of the Company’s common stock. 

 During the second quarter of 2009, the Company redeemed approximately $369.5 principal amount at maturity of its zero-coupon subordinated notes, equaling approximately 50% of the principal amount at maturity outstanding of the zero-coupon subordinated notes. The total cash used for these redemptions was $289.4. As a result of certain holders of the zero-coupon subordinated notes electing to convert their notes, the Company also issued 0.4 additional shares of common stock and reversed approximately $11.3 of deferred tax liability to reflect the tax benefit realized upon issuance of these shares. 

 Credit Ratings 

 The Company’s debt ratings of Baa2 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s contribute to its ability to access capital markets. 

48 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)   Contingent future licensing payments will be made if certain events take place, such as the launch of a specific test, the transfer of certain technology, and when specified revenue milestones are met.  

  (b)   Holders of the zero-coupon subordinated notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2011 at $819.54 per note ($290.6 in the aggregate). Should the holders put the notes to the Company on that date, the Company believes that it will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand, borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and additional financing if necessary. As announced by the Company on January 3, 2011, holders of the zero-coupon subordinated notes may choose to convert their notes during the first quarter of 2011 subject to terms as defined in the note agreement. See “Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information regarding the Company’s zero-coupon subordinated notes.    

  (c)   The table does not include obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are included in "Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements." Benefits under the Company's postretirement medical plan are made when claims are submitted for payment, the timing of which is not practicable to estimate.  

  (d)   The table does not include the Company’s reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company had a $65.8 and $73.7 reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is included in “Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements.” Substantially all of these tax reserves are classified in other long-term liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009.    

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 The Company does not have transactions or relationships with “special purpose” entities, and the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases. 

Other Commercial Commitments 

 At December 31, 2010, the Company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $37.4, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. Letters of credit provided by the Company are secured by the Company’s senior credit facilities and are renewed annually, around mid-year. 

 Effective January 1, 2008 the Company acquired additional partnership units in its Ontario, Canada (“Ontario”) joint venture for approximately $140.9 in cash (net of cash acquired), bringing the Company’s percentage interest owned to 85.6%. Concurrent with this acquisition, the terms of the joint venture’s partnership agreement were amended. Based upon the amended terms of this agreement, the Company began including the consolidated operating results, financial position and cash flows of the Ontario joint venture in the Company’s consolidated financial statements on January 1, 2008. The 

49 

amended joint venture’s partnership agreement also enabled the holders of the noncontrolling interest to put the remaining partnership units to the Company in defined future periods, at an initial amount equal to the consideration paid by the Company in 2008, and subject to adjustment based on market value formulas contained in the agreement. The initial difference of $123.0 between the value of the put and the underlying noncontrolling interest was recorded as additional noncontrolling interest liability and as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated financial statements. 

 In December 2009, the Company received notification from the holders of the noncontrolling interest in the Ontario joint venture that they intended to put their remaining partnership units to the Company in accordance with the terms of the joint venture’s partnership agreement. These units were acquired on February 8, 2010 for $137.5. On February 17, 2010, the Company completed a transaction to sell the units acquired from the previous noncontrolling interest holder to a new Canadian partner for the same price. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a component of noncontrolling interest in other liabilities and a component in mezzanine equity. Upon the completion of these two transactions, the Company’s financial ownership percentage in the joint venture partnership remained unc hanged at 85.6%. Concurrent with the sale to the new partner, the partnership agreement for the Ontario joint venture was amended and restated with substantially the same terms as the previous agreement. The combined contractual value of these puts, in excess of the current noncontrolling interest of $25.2, totals $143.5 at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, $148.1 has been classified as a current liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as the noncontrolling interest that acquired these units has the ability to put its units in the partnership to the Company on December 31, 2011. 

 At December 31, 2010, the Company was a guarantor on approximately $1.6 of equipment leases. These leases were entered into by a joint venture in which the Company owns a 50% interest and have a remaining term of approximately two years. 

 Based on current and projected levels of operations, coupled with availability under its senior credit facilities, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its anticipated short-term and long-term cash needs; however, the Company continually reassesses its liquidity position in light of market conditions and other relevant factors. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

 In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance in connection with adding qualified special purpose entities into the scope of guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities. This literature also modifies the analysis by which a controlling interest of a variable interest entity is determined thereby requiring the controlling interest to consolidate the variable interest entity. A controlling interest exists if a party to a variable interest entity has both (i) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity. The guidance became effective in 2010. The adopti on of the authoritative guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. While management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company’s Audit Committee periodically reviews the Company’s significant accounting policies. The Company’s critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: 

50 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 

 Revenue is recognized for services rendered when the testing process is complete and test results are reported to the ordering physician. The Company’s sales are generally billed to three types of payers – clients, patients and third parties such as managed care companies, Medicare and Medicaid. For clients, sales are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at the Company’s client list price, less any negotiated discount. Patient sales are recorded at the Company’s patient fee schedule, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. The Company bills third-party payers in two ways – fee-for-service and capitated agreements. Fee-for-service third-party payers are billed at the Company's patient fee schedule amount, and third-party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. These discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third-party payer. The majority of the Company’s third-party sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale. For the remaining third-party sales, estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue. These adjustments are not material to the Company’s results of operations in any period presented. The Company periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends. Under capitated agreements with managed care companies, the Company recognizes revenue based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or cost of services performed. 

 The Company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding. Bad debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level. The Company’s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment, and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables, historical and projected collection experience, and other external factors that could affect the collectibility of its receivables. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s write-off policy (e.g., when they are deemed to be uncollectible). In the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance, accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the Company’s receivables. These collection and reserve processes, along with the close monitoring of the billing process, help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience. The following table presents the percentage of the Company’s net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category at December 31, 2010 and 2009:

Pension Expense 

 In October 2009, the Company received approval from its Board of Directors to freeze any additional service-based credits for any years of service after December 31, 2009 on the Company Plan and the PEP. Both plans have been closed to new participants. Employees participating in the Company Plan and the PEP no longer earn service-based credits, but continue to earn interest credits. In addition, effective January 1, 2010, all employees eligible for the defined contribution retirement plan (the “401K Plan”) receive a minimum 3% non-elective contribution (“NEC”) concurrent with each payroll period. The 401K Plan also permits discretionary contributions by the Company of 1% to 3% of pay for eligible employees based on service. 

 The Company Plan covers substantially all employees hired prior to December 31, 2009. The benefits to be paid under the Company Plan are based on years of credited service through December 31, 2009, interest credits and average compensation. The Company also has the PEP which covers its senior management group. Prior to 2010, the PEP provided for the payment of the difference, if any, between the amount of any maximum limitation on annual benefit payments under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the annual benefit that would be payable under the Company Plan but for such limitation. 

 The Company's net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. The Company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit retirement plans were a 5.1% discount rate and a 7.5% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets as of December 31, 2010. 

Discount Rate 

 The Company evaluates several approaches toward setting the discount rate assumption that is used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. At year-end, priority was given to use of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and anticipated cash outflows of each retirement plan were discounted with the spot yields from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. A single-effective discount rate assumption was then determined for each retirement plan based on this analysis. A one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2010 retirement plan expense of $1.5. 

Return on Plan Assets 

 In establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the Company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. Actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. The change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2010 pension expense of $2.5. 

 Net pension cost for 2010 was $9.6 as compared with $36.6 in 2009 (including the impact of the $2.8 non-recurring net curtailment charge). The decrease in pension expense in 2010 was due to the changes to the Company Plan and PEP. Projected pension expense for the Company Plan and the PEP is expected to decrease from $9.6 in 2010 to $8.9 in 2011. 

 Further information on the Company’s defined benefit retirement plan is provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accruals for Self-insurance Reserves 

 Accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers’ compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical payment trends and claims history, actuarial assumptions and current and estimated future economic conditions. These estimated liabilities are not discounted. 

 The Company is self-insured (up to certain limits) for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. The Company maintains excess insurance which limits the Company’s maximum exposure on individual claims. The Company estimates a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. The liability is discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors for known and incurred but not reported claims based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by frequency and amount of claims. 

 If actual trends differ from these estimates, the financial results could be impacted. Historical trends have not differed materially from these estimates. 

 Income Taxes 

 The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that th e benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the Company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.
