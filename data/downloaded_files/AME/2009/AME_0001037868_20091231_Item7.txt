 Business Overview  

 As a global business, AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout most of 2009, the Company experienced lower order rates as a result of the global economic recession. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. In 2009, the Company posted solid sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share given the global economic recession. The impact of contributions from recent acquisitions combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives had a positive impact on 2009 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2009 were:  

       During 2009, the Company completed the following acquisitions:    

       In January 2009, the Company acquired High Standard Aviation. High Standard Aviation is a provider of electrical and electromechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic repair services to the aerospace industry.   

       In September 2009, the Company completed a small acquisition of two businesses in India, Unispec Marketing Pvt. Ltd. and Thelsha Technical Services Pvt. Ltd. This acquisition provides the Company with an established sales, distribution and service network in India serving the quality control and analytical instrumentation market.   

       In December 2009, the Company acquired Ameron Global, a manufacturer of highly engineered pressurized gas components and systems for commercial and aerospace customers. Ameron Global is also a leader in maintenance, repair and overhaul of fire suppression and oxygen supply systems    

       The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of consolidated sales in 2009, compared with $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated sales in 2008.   

       The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $101.4 million in 2009 before customer reimbursement of $5.5 million. Sales from products introduced in the last three years were $394.0 million or 18.8% of sales.   

       In 2009, the Company paid in full a 40 million British pound ($62.0 million) borrowing under the revolving credit facility in the second quarter and a 10.5 million British pound ($16.9 million) floating-rate term note in the fourth quarter.   

       As a result of the 2009 and 2008 Operational Excellence initiatives, which included initiatives associated with the 2008 year end restructuring, the Company achieved $135 million in cost savings in 2009. The 2008 year end restructuring included pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million).

 Results of Operations  

 In 2009, the Company posted solid sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow given the global economic recession. The Companys results include contributions from acquisitions completed in 2009 and the acquisitions of Motion Control Group (MCG), Drake Air (Drake) and Newage Testing Instruments in February 2008, Reading Alloys in April 2008, Vision Research, Inc. in June 2008, the programmable power business of Xantrex Technology, Inc. (Xantrex Programmable) in August 2008 and Muirhead Aerospace Limited (Muirhead) in November 2008. The Company believes the impact of the global economic recession stabilized in the third quarter of 2009, with increased operating results in the fourth quarter of 2009 in most of its markets when compared to the previous quarters of 2009, and expects operating results in 2010 to show further moderate improvement. The full year impact of the 2009 acquisitions and our Operational Excellence capabilities should have a positive impact on our 2010 results.  

 Net sales for 2009 were $2,098.4 million, a decrease of $432.7 million or 17.1% when compared with net sales of $2,531.1 million in 2008. Net sales for Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) were $1,146.6 million in 2009, a decrease of 18.3% from sales of $1,402.7 million in 2008. Net sales for Electromechanical Group (EMG) were $951.8 million in 2009, a decrease of 15.7% from sales of $1,128.5 million in 2008. The decline in net sales was primarily attributable to lower order rates as a result of the global economic recession, partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The Companys internal sales declined approximately 21% in 2009, which excludes a 2% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above offset approximately 6% of the Companys internal sales decline.  

 Total international sales for 2009 were $1,031.7 million or 49.2% of consolidated net sales, a decrease of $193.8 million or 15.8% when compared with international sales of $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated net sales in 2008. The decline in international sales resulted from decreased international sales from base businesses of    

 22   
 $272.5 million, which includes the effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2008. The Company maintains a strong international sales presence in Europe and Asia by both reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $400.6 million in 2009, a decrease of $77.9 million or 16.3% compared with $478.5 million in 2008. Export shipments declined primarily due to decreased exports from the base businesses, partially offset by the acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2009 were $2,028.1 million, a decrease of $533.4 million or 20.8% when compared with $2,561.5 million in 2008. Throughout most of 2009, the Company experienced lower order rates as a result of the global economic recession. However, order rates stabilized in the third quarter of 2009 and began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2009 was $648.4 million, a decrease of $70.2 million or 9.8% when compared with $718.6 million at December 31, 2008.  

 Segment operating income for 2009 was $399.5 million, a decrease of $82.4 million or 17.1% when compared with segment operating income of $481.9 million in 2008. Segment operating income, as a percentage of sales, was 19.0% in both 2009 and 2008. The decrease in segment operating income resulted primarily from the decrease in sales noted above and higher defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by profit contributions made by the acquisitions and cost reduction initiatives, including $135 million of cost savings achieved in 2009 primarily from the restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges. As a result of defined benefit pension plan contributions in 2009 and 2008, as well as overall stock market performance in 2009, the Company expects defined benefit pension expense to be lower in 2010.  

 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2009 were $254.1 million, a decrease of $68.5 million or 21.2% when compared with $322.6 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 12.1% for 2009, compared with 12.7% in 2008. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of lower sales and the Companys cost savings initiatives. Additionally, 2008 SG&A expenses includes both a $7.1 million charge, recorded in corporate administrative expenses, related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2005 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million of SG&A expense related to fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 22%, which was in line with the Companys 2009 sales decline. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 10.5% for 2009, compared with 10.8% in 2008 due to the previously mentioned cost savings initiatives.  

 Corporate administrative expenses for 2009 were $33.2 million, a decrease of $16.0 million or 32.5% when compared with $49.2 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.6% for 2009, compared with 1.9% in 2008. The decrease in corporate administrative expenses was driven by the equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second quarter of 2008, lower short-term incentive compensation in 2009 and the Companys cost saving initiatives, including the restructuring activities, noted above.  

 Consolidated operating income was $366.1 million or 17.4% of sales for 2009, a decrease of $66.6 million or 15.4% when compared with $432.7 million or 17.1% of sales in 2008.  

 Interest expense was $68.8 million for 2009, an increase of $5.1 million or 8.0% when compared with $63.7 million in 2008. The increase was due to the full-year impact of the funding of the long-term private placement senior notes in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, partially offset by the repayment of 40 million British-pound-denominated debt under the revolver in the second quarter of 2009.  

 The effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.2% compared with 32.6% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate for 2009 primarily reflects the impact of settlements of income tax examinations and benefits obtained from state and international income tax planning initiatives. The higher effective tax rate for 2008 primarily reflects an increase in state and foreign income taxes and the impact of accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock amortization, offset by the impact of settlements of various income tax issues with U.S. taxing authorities and a favorable agreement in the United Kingdom related to deductible interest expense for which previously unrecognized tax benefits were recognized. See Note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.   

 23   
 Net income for 2009 was $205.8 million, a decrease of $41.2 million or 16.7% when compared with $247.0 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2009 was $1.91, a decrease of $0.39 or 17.0% when compared with $2.30 per diluted share in 2008. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.  

 Segment Results  

 EIGs sales totaled $1,146.6 million for 2009, a decrease of $256.1 million or 18.3% when compared with $1,402.7 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an internal sales decline of approximately 20%, excluding an unfavorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIGs process and industrial products businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease was the 2008 acquisitions of Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex Programmable.  

 EIGs operating income was $232.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $73.9 million or 24.1% when compared with $306.8 million in 2008. EIGs operating margins were 20.3% of sales for 2009 compared with 21.9% of sales in 2008. The decrease in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the decrease in sales noted above, predominantly by weakness in the aerospace aftermarket, process and industrial businesses and higher defined benefit pension expense, which was partially offset by the cost savings achieved from the restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million had a negative impact on EIGs operating margins of 140 basis points.  

 EMGs sales totaled $951.8 million for 2009, a decrease of $176.7 million or 15.7% from $1,128.5 million in 2008. The sales decrease was due to an internal sales decline of approximately 21%, excluding an unfavorable 3% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by the engineered materials, interconnects and packaging products (EMIP) and cost driven motors businesses. Partially offsetting the sales decrease was the 2009 acquisition of High Standard Aviation and the 2008 acquisitions of Drake, MCG, Reading Alloys and Muirhead.  

 EMGs operating income was $166.6 million for 2009, a decrease of $8.6 million or 4.9% when compared with $175.2 million in 2008. EMGs decrease in operating income was driven by the decrease in sales noted above, predominantly by weakness in the EMIP businesses, which was partially offset by profit contributions made by the acquisitions mentioned above and the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $19.4 million. EMGs operating margins were 17.5% of sales for 2009 compared with 15.5% of sales in 2008. The increase in operating margins was primarily driven by Operational Excellence capabilities and cost reduction initiatives throughout the Group, including the cost savings achieved from the restructuring activities related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $19.4 million had a negative impact on operating margins of 170 basis points.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $523.5 million, a decrease of $100.2 million or 16.1% when compared with net sales of $623.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for EIG were $286.0 million in 2009, a decrease of 20.9% from sales of $361.6 million in 2008. Net sales for EMG were $237.5 million in 2009, a decrease of 9.4% from sales of $262.1 million in 2008. The Companys internal sales decline was approximately 20%, which excludes a 2% favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above offset approximately 2% of the Companys internal sales decline.  

 The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as part of cost    

 24   
 reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the Companys workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009. See Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.  

 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $51.9 million, an increase of $8.1 million or 18.5% when compared with $43.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.48, an increase of $0.07 or 17.1% when compared with $0.41 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.  

 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007  

 Results of Operations  

 In 2008, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved these results from contributions from acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007, as well as internal growth in both EIG and EMG. Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives.  

 Net sales for 2008 were $2,531.1 million, an increase of $394.2 million or 18.4% when compared with net sales of $2,136.9 million in 2007. Net sales for EIG were $1,402.7 million in 2008, an increase of 16.9% from sales of $1,199.8 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were $1,128.5 million in 2008, an increase of 20.4% from sales of $937.1 million in 2007. The Companys internal sales growth was approximately 4% in 2008, which excludes a 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

 Total international sales for 2008 were $1,225.5 million or 48.4% of consolidated net sales, an increase of $171.8 million or 16.3% when compared with international sales of $1,053.7 million or 49.3% of consolidated net sales in 2007. The increase in international sales resulted from increased international sales from base businesses of $29.3 million or 17.0% of the increase, which includes the effect of foreign currency translation, as well as the acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007, most notably Cameca SAS (Cameca), the Repair & Overhaul Division of Umeco plc (Umeco R&O), Reading Alloys, California Instruments Corporation (California Instruments) and Vision Research. Increased international sales came primarily from sales to Europe and Asia by both reportable segments. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $478.5 million in 2008, an increase of $84.1 million or 21.3% compared with $394.4 million in 2007. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2008 were a record at $2,561.5 million, an increase of $273.2 million or 11.9% when compared with $2,288.3 million in 2007. The increase in new orders was primarily due to the recent acquisitions noted above. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2008 was $718.6 million, an increase of $30.4 million or 4.4% when compared with $688.2 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in backlog was primarily due to the acquired backlog of the recent acquisitions noted above.  

 The year ended December 31, 2008 results include fourth quarter pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009.    

 25   
 The restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the Companys workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009.  

 Segment operating income for 2008 was $481.9 million, an increase of $54.4 million or 12.7% when compared with segment operating income of $427.5 million in 2007. Segment operating income, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 19.0% for 2008 from 20.0% in 2007. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from strength in the Companys differentiated businesses and profit contributions made by the acquisitions, partially offset by the fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges and asset write-downs described above. The decrease in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted segment operating margins by 160 basis points.  

 SG&A expenses for 2008 were $322.6 million, an increase of $59.1 million or 22.4% when compared with $263.5 million in 2007. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 12.7% for 2008, compared with 12.3% in 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses was the result of higher sales, as well as a $7.1 million charge  representing a 0.3% increase in SG&A expenses  recorded in corporate administrative expenses related to the accelerated vesting of an April 2005 restricted stock grant in the second quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million of SG&A expense related to the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs described above. Additionally, the Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased approximately 7.9%. Excluding the impact of the fourth quarter restructuring charges and asset write-downs on selling expense of $6.9 million, a 3.2% impact, and foreign currency translation, the increase in 2008 base business selling expenses was in line with internal sales growth. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 10.8% for 2008, compared with 10.4% in 2007.  

 Corporate administrative expenses for 2008 were $49.2 million, an increase of $8.4 million or 20.6% when compared with $40.8 million in 2007. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9%, in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily the result of equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the second quarter of 2008, noted above, as well as other expenses necessary to grow the Company, partially offset by equity-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in the first and third quarters of 2007.  

 Consolidated operating income was $432.7 million or 17.1% of sales for 2008, an increase of $46.1 million or 11.9% when compared with $386.6 million or 18.1% of sales in 2007.  

 Interest expense was $63.7 million for 2008, an increase of $16.8 million or 35.8% when compared with $46.9 million in 2007. The increase was due to the impact of the funding of the private placement senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third and fourth quarters of 2008, higher average borrowings to fund the recent acquisitions and the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of the Companys common stock in 2008.  

 The effective tax rate for 2008 was 32.6% compared with 32.2% in 2007. The higher effective tax rate for 2008 primarily reflects an increase in state and foreign income taxes and the impact of accelerated vesting of non-deductible restricted stock amortization, offset by the impact of settlements of various income tax issues with U.S. taxing authorities and a favorable agreement in the United Kingdom related to deductible interest expense for which previously unrecognized tax benefits were recognized. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 primarily reflects an enacted decrease in certain foreign corporate tax rates in the second half of 2007, partially offset by the elimination of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) tax benefit.  

 Net income for 2008 was $247.0 million, an increase of $19.0 million or 8.3% when compared with $228.0 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 was $2.30, an increase of $0.18 or 8.5% when compared with $2.12 per diluted share in 2007. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.

 Segment Results  

 EIGs sales totaled $1,402.7 million for 2008, an increase of $202.9 million or 16.9% when compared with $1,199.8 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 5%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EIGs aerospace, power, and process and analytical instrument businesses. The acquisitions of Advanced Industries, Inc., B&S Aircraft Parts and Accessories, Cameca, California Instruments, Vision Research, Inc. and Xantrex Programmable accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EIGs operating income was $306.8 million for 2008, an increase of $46.5 million or 17.9% when compared with $260.3 million in 2007. The increases in segment operating income were due to the contribution from the higher sales by EIGs aerospace, power and process and analytical businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $20.4 million. EIGs operating margins were 21.9% of sales for 2008 compared with 21.7% of sales in 2007. The increase in operating margins was driven by operational excellence initiatives throughout the group. The fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs had a negative impact on EIGs operating margins of 140 basis points.  

 EMGs sales totaled $1,128.5 million for 2008, an increase of $191.4 million or 20.4% from $937.1 million in 2007. The sales increase was due to internal growth of approximately 2%, excluding a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, driven primarily by EMGs differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of Seacon Phoenix, subsequently renamed AMETEK SCP, Inc., Hamilton Precision Metals, Umeco R&O, Drake Air, MCG, Reading Alloys and Muirhead accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EMGs operating income was $175.2 million for 2008, an increase of $8.0 million or 4.8% when compared with $167.2 million in 2007. EMGs increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales from the groups differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions mentioned above, partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $19.4 million. EMGs operating margins were 15.5% of sales for 2008 compared with 17.8% of sales in 2007. The decrease in operating margins was primarily driven by the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which had a negative impact on operating margins of 170 basis points. The remainder of the decrease was the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $623.7 million, an increase of $40.4 million or 6.9% when compared with net sales of $583.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales for EIG were $361.6 million in 2008, an increase of 7.6% from sales of $336.1 million in 2007. Net sales for EMG were $262.1 million in 2008, an increase of 6.1% from sales of $247.1 million in 2007. The Companys internal sales growth was approximately negative 2%, which excludes a 4% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions mentioned above made up the net sales increase.  

 The three months ended December 31, 2008 results include pre-tax charges totaling $40.0 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $27.3 million ($0.25 per diluted share). These charges include restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures ($32.6 million), as well as asset write-downs ($7.4 million). Of the $40.0 million in charges, $32.9 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in cost of sales and $7.1 million of the restructuring charges and asset write-downs were recorded in SG&A expenses. The restructuring charges and asset write-downs were reported in segment operating income as follows: $20.4 million in EIG, $19.4 million in EMG and $0.2 million in Corporate administrative and other expenses. The restructuring costs for employee reductions and facility closures relate to plans established by the Company as part of cost reduction initiatives that were broadly implemented across the Companys various businesses during fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs include the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the migration of production to low cost locales and a general reduction in workforce in response to lower levels of expected sales volumes in certain of the Companys businesses. The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $30.1 million for severance costs for more than 10% of the Companys workforce. The Company also recorded pre-tax charges of $1.5 million for lease termination costs associated with the closure of certain facilities in 2009.   

 27   
 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $43.8 million, a decrease of $18.1 million or 29.2% when compared with $61.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $0.41, a decrease of $0.16 or 28.1% when compared with $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of the fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring charges and asset write-downs, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.25 per diluted share.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $364.7 million in 2009, an increase of $117.4 million or 47.5% when compared with $247.3 million in 2008. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of lower overall operating working capital levels, which includes the impact of a tax refund received in 2009 that resulted from the Companys higher year end 2008 defined benefit pension contributions and $21.1 million in defined benefit pension contributions paid in 2009, compared with $79.9 million in defined benefit pension contributions paid in 2008. As a result of the 2009 and 2008 defined benefit pension plan contributions, as well as overall stock market performance in 2009, the Companys overall defined benefit pension plans were over funded at December 31, 2009. The increase in cash provided by lower overall operating working capital was partially offset by the $41.2 million decrease in net income. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital spending) was $331.6 million in 2009, compared to $203.1 million in 2008. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $428.0 million in 2009, compared with $489.4 million in 2008, which includes the fourth quarter of 2008 pre-tax restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $40.0 million. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 Cash used for investing activities totaled $106.3 million in 2009, compared with $496.6 million in 2008. In 2009, the Company paid $72.9 million for three business acquisitions, net of cash received, compared with $463.0 million paid for six business acquisitions and one technology line acquisition, net of cash received, in 2008. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $33.1 million in 2009, compared with $44.2 million in 2008.  

 Cash used for financing activities totaled $102.5 million in 2009, compared with $173.5 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2008. In 2009, net total borrowings decreased by $92.4 million, compared with a net total borrowings increase of $266.9 million in 2008. Short-term borrowings decreased $13.0 million in 2009, compared with an increase of $69.7 million in 2008. Long-term borrowings decreased $79.4 million in 2009, compared to an increase of $197.2 million in 2008.  

 During the second quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a 40 million British pound ($62.0 million) borrowing under the revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company paid in full a 10.5 million British pound ($16.9 million) floating-rate term note.  

 In May 2009, the Company chose not to renew its $100 million accounts receivable securitization facility. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2008.  

 In July 2008, the Company paid in full the $225 million 7.20% senior notes due July 2008 using the proceeds from borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.  

 The second funding of the third quarter of 2007 private placement agreement to sell $450 million occurred in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018. The 2007 private placement carries a weighted average interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the second funding of the notes were used to pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility.  

 In the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $350 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There were two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2008 for $250 million, consisting of $90 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due September 2015 and $160 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.08% senior notes due September 2018. The second funding date occurred in December 2008 for $100 million, consisting of $35 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.69% senior notes due December 2015 and $65 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.18% senior notes due December 2018. The senior notes carry a weighted average interest rate    

 28   
 of 6.93%. The senior notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt-to-EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility.  

 The Companys revolving credit facilitys total borrowing capacity is $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The term of the facility is June 2012. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $532.2 million available under its revolving credit facility, including the $100 million accordion feature. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility.  

 At December 31, 2009, total debt outstanding was $1,041.7 million, compared with $1,111.7 million at December 31, 2008, with no significant maturities until 2012. The debt-to-capital ratio was 39.9% at December 31, 2009, compared with 46.3% at December 31, 2008. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders equity) was 33.7% at December 31, 2009, compared with 44.3% at December 31, 2008. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 Additional financing activities for 2009 include the receipt of net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $11.6 million compared with $7.5 million in 2008. Cash dividends paid were $25.6 million in 2009, compared with $25.7 million in 2008. In 2008, the Company repaid $21.4 million in life insurance policy loans.  

 Repurchases of 1.3 million shares of the Companys common stock in 2008 totaled $57.4 million. No shares were repurchased in 2009. At December 31, 2009, $68.5 million was available under the current Board authorization for future share repurchases. On January 28, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of $75 million in the authorization for the repurchase of its common stock. This increase was added to the $68.5 million that remained available from existing authorizations approved in 2008, for a total of $143.5 million available for repurchases of the Companys common stock. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 1,128,200 shares of its common stock for approximately $41.8 million. The remaining balance available for repurchases of the Companys common stock is $101.7 million as of the filing of this report.  

 As a result of all of the Companys cash flow activities in 2009, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 totaled $246.4 million, compared with $87.0 million at December 31, 2008. Additionally, the Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants, which includes its financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.   

 29   
 The following table summarizes AMETEKs contractual cash obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future years at December 31, 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)    Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007 and the $350 million private placement completed in 2008.  

  (2)    Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca acquisition. The lease has a term of twelve years, which began July 2006, and is payable quarterly.  

  (3)    Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.  

  (4)    The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.   

 Other Commitments  

 The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $20.4 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2009. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.  

 The Company may, from time to time, repurchase its long-term debt in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon availability, market conditions and other factors.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  

       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk      

 30   
      of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $16.0 million, $16.1 million and $14.4 million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $8.2 million, $12.2 million and $11.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.    

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting units based upon the reporting unit in which that operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  

 The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair    

 31   
 value of its reporting units in a sales transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long range plan. The Companys long range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) from this hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value ranged from an excess of the fair values of the Companys reporting units over their respective carrying values of 22% to 411% for each of the Companys reporting units.  

 The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.  

 The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2009, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $1,447.4 million, or 44.6% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2009 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.  

 Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives are considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.  

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2009, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2009 pension cost was 6.50% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.09% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2009 and determining the 2010 defined benefit pension cost is 5.90% for U.S. plans and 5.98% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2009 of 8.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.97% for foreign plans. The Company will continue to use these rates for 2010 for the U.S. and foreign plans, respectively. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the      

 32   
      pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2009 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.98% for the foreign plans. Both the U.S. and foreign plans rates of compensation will remain unchanged in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension expense of $10.3 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans as compared with pre-tax pension income of $6.8 million recognized for these plans in 2008. The Company estimates its 2010 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans pre-tax income to be approximately $1.6 million.    

 All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.  

 To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during 2009 which totaled $21.1 million, compared with $79.9 million in 2008. The Company anticipates making approximately $2.0 million to $5.0 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.    

 The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

 The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

 Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards  

 In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Fair value Measurements and Disclosures (ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures and require new disclosures related to fair value measurements, particularly to provide greater disaggregated information on each class of assets and liabilities and more robust disclosures on transfers between levels 1 and 2 and activity in level 3 fair value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about activity in level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2010-06 on our fair value measurement disclosures.   

 33   
 In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (ASU 2009-14). ASU 2009-14 provides guidance for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality of the hardware. ASU 2009-14 provides factors to help constituents determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality of the tangible product. This guidance will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables. ASU 2009-14 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009-13). ASU 2009-13 provides guidance on accounting and reporting for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities. ASU 2009-13 provides guidance for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. ASU 2009-13 also requires significantly expanded disclosures to provide information about a vendors multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and the judgments made by the vendor that affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05, Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value (ASU 2009-05), which provides clarification on the application of fair value techniques when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available and clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability, the fair value is not adjusted to reflect the impact of contractual restrictions that prevent its transfer. ASU 2009-05 was effective on October 1, 2009 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In June 2009, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codificationtm and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (SFAS 168). SFAS 168 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with GAAP in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy). Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. SFAS 168 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 168 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In May 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subsequent Events Topic 855, (ASC 855). ASC 855 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company evaluated all events and transactions that occurred after December 31, 2009 up through February 25, 2010, the date the Company issued these financial statements. During this period, the Company did not have any material recognizable or non-recognizable subsequent events.  

 The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with FASB ASC Business Combinations Topic 805 (ASC 805), which includes provisions adopted effective January 1, 2009. The accounting for business combinations retains the underlying concepts of the previously issued standard, but changes the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects. These changes were effective on a prospective basis for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. Adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to January 1, 2009 would also apply the revised accounting for business combination provisions. The adoption of certain provisions within ASC 805 effective January 1, 2009 did not have a significant impact on the Companys    

 34   
 consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, depending on the nature of an acquisition or the quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption, ASC 805 may significantly impact the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows and result in more earnings volatility and generally lower earnings due to, among other items, the expensing of transaction costs and restructuring costs of acquired companies.  

 In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 820-10-65-4, Transition Related to FASB Staff Position FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (ASC 820-10-65-4). ASC 820-10-65-4 amends ASC 820, and provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly for fair value measurements. ASC 820-10-65-4 is applied prospectively with retrospective application not permitted. ASC 820-10-65-4 was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 820-10-65-4 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 320-10-65-1, Transition Related to FASB Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (ASC 320-10-65-1). ASC 320-10-65-1 amends previously issued standards to make the other-than-temporary impairments guidance more operational and to improve the presentation of other-than-temporary impairments in the financial statements. ASC 320-10-65-1 replaces the existing requirement that the entitys management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired debt security until recovery with a requirement that management assert it does not have the intent to sell the security, and it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. ASC 320-10-65-1 provides increased disclosure about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold and also requires increased and more frequent disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. Although ASC 320-10-65-1 does not result in a change in the carrying amount of debt securities, it does require that the portion of an other-than-temporary impairment not related to a credit loss for a held-to-maturity security be recognized in a new category of other comprehensive income and be amortized over the remaining life of the debt security as an increase in the carrying value of the security. ASC 320-10-65-1 was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 320-10-65-1 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1, Transition Related to FASB Staff Position FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10-65-1). ASC 825-10-65-1 amends previously issued standards to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. Prior to ASC 825-10-65-1, fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed annually. ASC 825-10-65-1 applies to all financial instruments within the scope of ASC 825 and requires all entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. ASC 825-10-65-1 was effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. See Note 15.

 Capital Expenditures  

 Capital expenditures were $33.1 million or 1.6% of sales in 2009, compared with $44.2 million or 1.7% of sales in 2008. 56% of the expenditures in 2009 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2009 capital expenditures decreased due to the global economic recession with a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. The 2010 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 2.0% of sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.  

 Product Development and Engineering  

 The Company is committed to research, product development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, product development    

 35   
 and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $101.4 million, $115.9 million and $102.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $5.5 million, $6.1 million and $7.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $50.5 million, $57.5 million and $52.9 million, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.  

 Environmental Matters  

 Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2009, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 16 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In ten of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the two remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

 Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $27.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively, for non-owned and owned sites. In 2009, the Company received $1.3 million of additional reserves from a third party for existing sites. Additionally, the Company spent $2.7 million on environmental matters in 2009. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 include reserves of $19.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2009, the Company has $13.9 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.  

 The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, as discussed further in the following paragraph.  

 In August 2009, the Company agreed to a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board regarding the 2008 Notice of Administrative Civil Liability related to a former    

 36   
 subsidiary which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007, whereby the Company paid and deferred minor penalties, which were covered by previously establish reserves.  

 The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  

 Market Risk  

 The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  

 The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

 The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

 Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

 Forward-Looking Information  

 Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
