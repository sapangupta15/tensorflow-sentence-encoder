MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp had $141.1 billion in assets and operates 1,254 full-service banking centers, including 95 Bank Mart® locations, open seven days a week, inside select grocery stores and 2,593 ATMs in twelve states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. The Bancorp also has an approximate 18% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC. The carrying value of the Bancorps investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC was $360 million as of December 31, 2015.  

This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorps financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.  

The Bancorps revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 54% and 46% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.  

 Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as 

 part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of losses on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral due to a weakened economy within the Bancorps footprint.  

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, investment advisory revenue, corporate banking revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, card and processing revenue, securities gains, net and other noninterest income. Noninterest expense includes personnel costs, net occupancy expense, technology and communication costs, card and processing expense, equipment expense and other noninterest expense.  

Vantiv, Inc. and Vantiv Holding, LLC Transactions  

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. under which a portion of its TRA with Vantiv, Inc. was terminated and settled in full for a cash payment of approximately $49 million from Vantiv, Inc. Under the agreement, the Bancorp sold certain TRA cash flows it expected to receive from 2017 to 2030, totaling an estimated $140 million. Approximately half of the sold TRA cash flows related to 2025 and later. This sale did not impact the TRA payment recognized during the fourth quarter of 2015 and is not expected to impact the TRA payment to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to the impact of the TRA termination discussed above, the Bancorp recognized $31 million, $23 million and $9 million in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the TRA during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

The Bancorp agreed during the fourth quarter of 2015 to cancel rights to purchase approximately 4.8 million Class C units in Vantiv Holding, LLC, the wholly-owned principal operating subsidiary of Vantiv, Inc., underlying the Bancorps warrant in exchange for a cash payment of $200 million. Subsequent to this cancellation, the Bancorp exercised its right to purchase approximately 7.8 million Class C units underlying the Bancorps warrant at the $15.98 strike price. This exercise was settled on a net basis for approximately 5.4 million Class C units, which were then exchanged for approximately 5.4 million shares of Vantiv, Inc. Class A common stock that were sold in the secondary offering. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on the 62% of the warrant that was settled or net exercised.  

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp exchanged 8 million Class B units of Vantiv Holding, LLC for 8 million Class A shares in Vantiv, Inc., which were also sold in the secondary offering, and on which the Bancorp recognized a gain of $331 million. The Bancorps remaining investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC continues to be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For more information, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan  

The Bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience in its consumer distribution network. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining full-service branches at certain of its existing banking center locations. Similarly, the Bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

On June 16, 2015, the Bancorps Board of Directors authorized management to pursue a plan to further develop its distribution strategy, including a plan to consolidate and/or sell certain operating branch locations and to sell certain parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired by the Bancorp for future branch expansion (the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan). The Bancorp expects to receive $60 million in annual savings from operating expenses upon completion of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan.  

On September 3, 2015, the Bancorp announced the decision to enter into an agreement to sell branch banking locations, retail accounts, certain private banking deposits and related loan relationships in the Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank of Pennsylvania. On September 30, 2015, the Bancorp announced the decision to enter into an agreement to sell its retail operations, including retail accounts, certain private banking deposits and related loan relationships in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank. Both transactions are part of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan and are expected to close in the first half of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the Bancorp intended to consolidate and/or sell 107 operating branch locations and to sell an additional 32 parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired by the Bancorp for future branch expansion. For further information on a subsequent event related to the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan, refer to Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Impairment losses associated with such assessments and lower of cost or market adjustments were $109 million, $20 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The recognized impairment losses were recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For more information on the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions  

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorps common stock during the term of the repurchase agreements. For more information on the accelerated share repurchase program, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of the Bancorps accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into or settled during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, refer to Table 2. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Senior Notes Offerings  

On July 27, 2015, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.1 billion of 2.875% unsecured senior fixed-rate notes, with a maturity of five years, due on July 27, 2020. The notes are not subject to redemption at the Bancorps option at any time until 30 days prior to maturity.  

 On August 20, 2015, the Bank issued and sold $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior bank notes, with a maturity of three years, due on August 20, 2018. The bank notes consisted of $1.0 billion of 2.15% senior fixed-rate notes and $250 million of senior floating-rate notes. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed-rate notes to floating-rate, which resulted in an effective rate of three-month LIBOR plus 90 bps. Interest on the floating-rate notes is three-month LIBOR plus 91 bps. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. For additional information on the senior notes offerings, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Automobile Loan Securitization  

On November 5, 2015, the Bancorp transferred an aggregate amount of approximately $750 million in consumer automobile 

 loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a VIE. The Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE and, therefore, has consolidated this VIE. For additional information on the automobile loan securitization refer to Note 11 and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Legislative and Regulatory Developments  

The FDIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in October of 2015 which would implement a 4.5 bps surcharge on the quarterly FDIC insurance assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The surcharge would take effect at the same time the FDIC is required to lower the regular FDIC insurance assessments by approximately 2 bps under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011 that is triggered by the DIF reserve ratio reaching 1.15% of insured deposits. The FDIC estimates the DIF reserve ratio will reach 1.15% in 2016 and the surcharge would be sufficient to raise the DIF reserve ratio to the 1.35% minimum mandated by the DFA in approximately eight quarters. Fifth Third estimates the proposed changes to the FDIC assessments would result in a net increase in its FDIC insurance expense of approximately $25 million on an annual basis. The comment period for this proposal ended January 5, 2016.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

On September 30, 2015, the Bancorp agreed to pay approximately $85 million to cover losses on approximately 500 loans for which HUD had paid FHA insurance claims, and an additional $2 million to HUD, in connection with the Bancorps entry into a Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Dismissal with the DOJ and HUD, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 5, 2015, and a related Settlement Agreement with HUD. On September 28, 2015, the Bancorp entered into consent orders and agreed, without admitting or denying any of the findings of fact or conclusions of law (except to establish jurisdiction), to pay $18 million to consumers in a settlement with the DOJ and the CFPB related to an investigation into whether Fifth Third Bank engaged in any discriminatory practices in connection with the Banks indirect automobile loan portfolio. On September 28, 2015, the Bancorp agreed to pay an amount not less than $3 million in redress to consumers and a civil penalty of $500,000 to the CFPB in connection with its entry into a consent order with the CFPB related to the marketing and administration of the Bancorps debt protection credit card add-on product for those enrolled in the product from January 1, 2007 through November 11, 2013. For additional information on these legal and regulatory proceedings refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

On March 11, 2015, the Bancorp announced the results of its capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2015 CCAR. The FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the following capital actions for the period beginning April 1, 2015 and ending June 30, 2016:  

   ●  The potential increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14 per share in 2016;  

   ●  The potential repurchase of common shares in an amount up to $765 million; and  

   ●  The additional ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. common stock.  

The BHCs that participated in the 2015 CCAR, including the Bancorp, were required to conduct mid-cycle company-run stress tests using data as of March 31, 2015. For more information on the 2015 CCAR results and 2015 mid-cycle stress test, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Fifth Third offers qualified deposit customers a deposit advance product if they choose to avail themselves of this product to meet short-term, small-dollar financial needs. In April of 2013, the CFPB issued a White Paper which studied financial services industry offerings and customer use of deposit advance products as well as payday loans and is considering whether rules governing these products are warranted. At the same time, the OCC and FDIC each issued proposed supervisory guidance for public comment to institutions they supervise which supplements existing OCC and FDIC guidance, detailing the principles they expect financial institutions to follow in connection with deposit advance products and supervisory expectations for the use of deposit advance products. The Federal Reserve also issued a statement in April of 2013 to state member banks like Fifth Third for whom the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator. This statement encouraged state member banks to respond to customers small-dollar credit needs in a responsible manner; emphasized that they should take into consideration the risks associated with deposit advance products, including potential consumer harm and potential elevated compliance risk; and reminded them that these product offerings must comply with applicable laws and regulations.  

Fifth Thirds deposit advance product is designed to fully comply with the applicable federal and state laws and use of this 

 product is subject to strict eligibility requirements and advance restriction guidelines to limit dependency on this product as a borrowing source. The Bancorps deposit advance balances are included in other consumer loans and leases in the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A and in Table 9 in the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. On January 17, 2014, given developments in industry practice, Fifth Third announced that it would no longer enroll new customers in its deposit advance product and expected to phase out the service to existing customers by the end of 2014. To avoid a disruption to its existing customers during the extension period while the banking industry awaits further regulatory guidance on the deposit advance product, on November 3, 2014, Fifth Third announced changes to its current deposit advance product for existing customers beginning January 1, 2015, including a lower transaction fee, an extended repayment period and a reduced maximum advance period. The Bancorp is continuing to offer the service to existing deposit advance customers until further regulatory guidance is finalized. These changes to the deposit advance product negatively impacted net interest income by $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

In July of 2013, U.S. banking regulators approved final enhanced regulatory capital requirements (Basel III Final Rule), which included modifications to the proposed rules. The Basel III Final Rule provided for certain banks, including the Bancorp, to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital and also retained the treatment of residential mortgage exposures consistent with the current Basel I capital rules. The Basel III Final Rule phases out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I capital. The Bancorp became subject to the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2015. The Bancorp made a one-time permanent election not to include AOCI in regulatory capital in the March 31, 2015 FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C filings. For more information on the impact of the regulatory capital enhancements, refer to the Capital Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.  

On December 10, 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized section 619 of the DFA, known as the Volcker Rule, which became effective April 1, 2014. Though the Final Rule was effective April 1, 2014, the FRB granted the industry an extension of time until July 21, 2015 to conform certain of its activities related to proprietary trading to comply with the Volcker Rule. In addition, the FRB has granted the industry an extension of time until July 21, 2016, and announced its intention to grant a one year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform certain ownership interests in, sponsorship activities of and relationships with private equity or hedge funds as well as holding certain collateralized loan obligations that were in place as of December 31, 2013. It is possible that additional conformance period extensions could be granted either to the entire industry, or, upon request, to requesting banking organizations on a case-by-case basis. The Final Rule prohibits banks and BHCs from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments for their own account. The Volcker Rule also restricts banks and their affiliated entities from owning, sponsoring or having certain relationships with private equity and hedge funds, as well as holding certain collateralized loan obligations that are deemed to contain ownership interests. Exemptions are provided for certain activities such as underwriting, market making, hedging, trading in certain government obligations and organizing and offering a hedge fund or private equity fund. Fifth Third does not sponsor any private equity or hedge funds that, under the Final Rule, it is prohibited from sponsoring.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp did not hold collateralized loan obligations. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp had approximately $186 million in interests and approximately $37 million in binding commitments to invest in private equity funds that are affected by the Volcker Rule. It is expected that over time the Bancorp may need to dispose of these investments, however no formal plan to sell has been approved as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the announced conformance period extension, the Bancorp believes it is likely that these investments will be reduced over time in the ordinary course of events before compliance is required.  

On October 10, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies published final rules implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the LCR standard established by the BCBS for large internationally active banking organizations, generally those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. In addition, a modified LCR requirement was implemented for BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not internationally active, such as Fifth Third. The Modified LCR became effective January 1, 2016 and requires BHCs to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for further discussion on these ratios.  

On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a case challenging certain provisions of the FRBs rule concerning electronic debit card transaction fees and network 

 exclusivity arrangements (the Current Rule) that were adopted to implement Section 1075 of the DFA, known as the Durbin Amendment. The Court held that, in adopting the Current Rule, the FRB violated the Durbin Amendments provisions concerning which costs are allowed to be taken into account for purposes of setting fees that are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by the issuer and, therefore, the Current Rules maximum permissible fees were too high. In addition, the Court held that the Current Rules network non-exclusivity provisions concerning unaffiliated payment networks for debit cards also violated the Durbin Amendment. The Court vacated the Current Rule, but stayed its ruling to provide the FRB an opportunity to replace the invalidated portions. The FRB appealed this decision and on March 21, 2014, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. The merchants have filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, on January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Circuit Court reversal, thereby largely upholding the Current Rule and substantially reducing uncertainty surrounding debit card interchange fees the Bancorp is permitted to charge. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for further information regarding the Bancorps debit card interchange revenue.

Earnings Summary  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $2.01 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.4 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, which was net of $67 million in preferred stock dividends. Pre-provision net revenue was $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net interest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in the net interest rate spread, changes made to the Bancorps deposit advance product beginning 

 January 1, 2015 and an increase in average long-term debt of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in average taxable securities and average loans and leases of $5.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Net interest margin on an FTE basis was 2.88% and 3.10% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Noninterest income increased $530 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue partially offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue. Other noninterest income increased $529 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a gain of $125 million during the second quarter of 2014.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $236 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC. Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $49 million from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the TRA and also recognized a gain of $31 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $23 million associated with the TRA during the fourth quarter of 2014. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $38 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in net mortgage servicing revenue and origination fees and gains on loan sales. Corporate banking revenue decreased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by decreases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in personnel costs, technology and communications expense and card and processing expense partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. Personnel costs increased $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by higher executive retirement and severance costs as well as an increase in base compensation and an increase in incentive compensation, primarily in the mortgage business. Technology and communications expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance, and other growth initiatives. Card and processing expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased fraud prevention related expenses. Other noninterest expense decreased $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in losses and adjustments partially offset by increases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, marketing expense, donations expense, impairment on affordable housing investments, FDIC insurance and other taxes and operating lease expense.  

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense, refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A.  

Credit Summary  

The provision for loan and lease losses was $396 million and $315 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.64% during the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO decreased to 0.70% compared to 0.82% at December 31, 2014. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.  

Capital Summary  

The Bancorps capital ratios exceed the well-capitalized guidelines as defined by the PCA requirements of the U.S. banking agencies. As of December 31, 2015, as calculated under the Basel III 

 transition provisions, the CET1 capital ratio was 9.82%, the Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 10.93%, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 14.13% and the Tier I leverage ratio was 9.54%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The following are non-GAAP measures which are important to the reader of the Consolidated Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures.  

The Bancorp considers many factors when determining the adequacy of its liquidity profile, including its LCR as defined by the U.S. banking agencies Basel III LCR Final Rule. Generally, the LCR is designed to ensure banks maintain an adequate level of unencumbered HQLA to satisfy the estimated net cash outflows under a 30-day stress scenario. The Bancorp is subject to the 

 Modified LCR whereby the net cash outflow under the 30-day stress scenario is multiplied by a factor of 0.7. The LCR Final Rule became effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2016. The Bancorp believes there is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to the LCR. The Bancorp believes providing an estimated Modified LCR is important for comparability to other financial institutions. For a further discussion on liquidity management and the LCR, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Pre-provision net revenue is net interest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense. The Bancorp believes this 

 measure is important because it provides a ready view of the Bancorps pre-tax earnings before the impact of provision expense. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of pre-provision net revenue to U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial 

 institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. 

The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31:

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the Bancorp became subject to the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2015. The CET1 capital ratio is a new 

 measure defined by the banking regulatory agencies under the Basel III Final Rule. The CET1 capital ratio has transition provisions that will be phased out over time. The Bancorp is presenting the CET1 capital ratio on a fully phased-in basis for comparative purposes with other organizations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Bancorps capital adequacy using these ratios, the Bancorp believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards adopted 

 by the Bancorp during 2015 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorps financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. No material changes were made to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

ALLL  

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of the Bancorps ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. The Bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.  

The Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgement and is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or pools of loans.  

 Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include 

 the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.  

Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.  

Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. Factors that management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; trends in the nature and volume of delinquencies, charge-offs and nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the Bancorps internal credit reviewers.  

The Bancorps primary market areas for lending are the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorps customers.  

Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the Bancorps ALLL sensitivity analysis.  

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorps ALLL, as discussed above.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Income Taxes  

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the Bancorp operates are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. The Bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering relevant statutes, regulations, judicial decisions and other information. The Bancorp maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these items.  

Changes in the estimate of tax accruals occur periodically as a result of changes in tax rates, interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and other guidance issued by tax authorities and the status of examinations conducted by tax authorities, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations. These changes may significantly impact the Bancorps tax accruals, deferred taxes and income tax expense and may significantly impact the operating results of the Bancorp.  

Deferred taxes are determined using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is calculated based on the difference between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Significant management judgment is required to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Where management has determined that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance is maintained. For additional information on income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Valuation of Servicing Rights  

When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. Servicing rights resulting from loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Significant management judgement is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS spread and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. In order to assist in this assessment, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the MSR portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the 

 reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. For purposes of measuring impairment, the MSRs are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate) and interest rates. For additional information on servicing rights, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Fair Value Measurements  

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.  

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The level of management judgement necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. Financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) require minimal judgement. The valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgement to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets, and, the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. Table 8 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using Level 3 inputs.

Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments.  

Goodwill  

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the methodology used by the Bancorp to assess goodwill for impairment.  

Impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorps stock, the key financial performance metrics of the reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the two-step impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp would be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.  

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Since none of the Bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorps stock price. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorps stock during the month 

 including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.  

When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers.  

During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Significant management judgement is necessary in the identification and valuation of unrecognized intangible assets and the valuation of the reporting units recorded assets and liabilities. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment process. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps goodwill.  

Legal Contingencies  

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps legal proceedings.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RISK FACTORS  

The risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Bancorps financial condition, the results of its operations, or its business.  

RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS  

Weakness in the U.S. economy, including within Fifth Thirds geographic footprint, has adversely affected Fifth Third in the past and may adversely affect Fifth Third in the future.  

If the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the strength of the local economies in which Fifth Third conducts operations declines, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant effect on Fifth Thirds loan portfolio and ALLL and in the receipt of lower proceeds from the sale of loans and foreclosed properties. These factors could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses in future periods, which could materially adversely affect Fifth Thirds financial condition and results of operations.  

Global financial conditions could hamper economic recovery or contribute to recessionary economic conditions and severe stress in the financial markets, including in the United States. Should the U.S. economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, the likelihood for loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like Fifth Third, may deteriorate.  

The global financial markets continue to be strained as a result of economic slowdowns, geopolitical concerns and the related path of commodity prices and interest rates. Divergence in economic growth in the U.S. and international economies and the resulting differences in monetary policy are placing strains on financial markets and strengthening the U.S. dollar. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar may continue to negatively impact the U.S. manufacturing sector. These factors could negatively impact the U.S. economy and affect the stability of global financial markets.  

Changes in interest rates could affect Fifth Thirds income and cash flows.  

Fifth Thirds income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Fifth Thirds control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in particular, the FRB). Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if Fifth Third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect Fifth Third and its shareholders.  

Changes and trends in the capital markets may affect Fifth Thirds income and cash flows.  

Fifth Third enters into and maintains trading and investment positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and manages investment positions on behalf of its customers. These investment positions include derivative financial instruments. The revenues and profits Fifth Third derives from managing proprietary and customer trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices. Market changes and trends may result in a decline in investment 

 advisory revenue or investment or trading losses that may impact Fifth Third. Losses on behalf of its customers could expose Fifth Third to litigation, credit risks or loss of revenue from those clients and customers. Additionally, losses in Fifth Thirds trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those investments and may adversely affect cash flows and funding costs.  

Problems encountered by financial institutions larger than or similar to Fifth Third could adversely affect financial markets generally and have direct and indirect adverse effects on Fifth Third.  

Fifth Third has exposure to counterparties in the financial services industry and other industries, and routinely executes transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of Fifth Thirds transactions with other financial institutions expose Fifth Third to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, Fifth Thirds credit risk may be affected when the collateral it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Bancorp interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect Fifth Third.  

Fifth Thirds stock price is volatile.  

Fifth Thirds stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:  

   ●    Actual or anticipated variations in earnings;  

   ●    Changes in analysts recommendations or projections;  

   ●    Fifth Thirds announcements of developments related to its businesses;  

   ●    Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;  

   ●    Actions by government regulators;  

   ●    New technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors;  

   ●    News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry;  

   ●    Natural disasters;  

   ●    Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.  

The price for shares of Fifth Thirds common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to Fifth Thirds performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of Fifth Thirds common stock, and the current market price of such shares may not be indicative of future market prices.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Fifth Thirds investments in its bank premises and equipment and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.  

Fifth Third has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network including its 1,254 full-service banking centers, 56 parcels of land held for the development of future banking centers, as well as its retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing Fifth Thirds products and services, could affect the value of Fifth Thirds branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force. Further advances in technology and/or changes in customer preferences could have additional changes in Fifth Thirds retail distribution strategy and/or branch network. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.  

RISKS RELATING TO FIFTH THIRDS GENERAL BUSINESS  

Deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted Fifth Third in the past and may adversely impact Fifth Third in the future.  

When Fifth Third lends money or commits to lend money the Bancorp incurs credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans. The credit performance of the loan portfolios significantly affects the Bancorps financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and reserves for credit losses. Fifth Third reserves for credit losses by establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. The amount of these reserves is based on Fifth Thirds assessment of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments. The process for determining the amount of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments is critical to Fifth Thirds financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the environment, including analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans.  

Fifth Third might underestimate the credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved. Fifth Third might increase the reserve because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrowers behavior. As an example, borrowers may strategically default, or discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they are still financially able to make the payments. 

Fifth Third believes that both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments are adequate to cover inherent losses at December 31, 2015; however, there is no assurance that they will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, Fifth Third may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce earnings. 

For more information, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A and the Allowance for Loan and Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments subsections of the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A.  

Fifth Third must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.  

Fifth Third must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. Fifth Third primarily relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans Fifth Third makes and the operations of Fifth Thirds business. Core deposits, which include transaction deposits and other time deposits, have historically provided Fifth Third with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds (average core deposits funded 71% of average total assets at December 31, 2015). In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include investments in the securities portfolio, Fifth Thirds sale or securitization of loans in secondary markets and the pledging of loans and investment securities to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and Fifth Thirds ability to raise funds in domestic and international money and capital markets.  

Fifth Thirds liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. 

Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect Fifth Thirds liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in Fifth Third or negative news about Fifth Third or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, increased regulatory requirements, and reductions in one or more of Fifth Thirds credit ratings. A reduced credit rating could adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which Fifth Third has little or no control such as what occurred during the financial crisis. While market conditions have stabilized and, in many cases, improved, there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.  

Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact Fifth Thirds results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations recently adopted or proposed, and additional regulations under consideration, impose or could impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including Fifth Third. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. Given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, including the resolution and recovery framework applicable to Fifth Third, the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations will remain uncertain until their full implementation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

If Fifth Third is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if Fifth Third suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively; then Fifth Thirds liquidity, operating margins, and financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As Fifth Third did during the financial crisis, it may also need to raise additional capital through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends to preserve capital.  

Fifth Third may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent loans are concentrated by location or industry of the borrowers or collateral.  

Fifth Thirds credit risk and credit losses can increase if its loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and commodity and real estate values in these states and generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses.  

Fifth Third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties.  

Fifth Third sells residential mortgage loans to various parties, including GSEs and other financial institutions that purchase residential mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. Fifth Third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a specified period (usually 60 days or less) after Fifth Third receives notice of the breach. Contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to inadequate responses to repurchase requests. If economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or future investor repurchase demand and Fifth Thirds success at appealing repurchase requests differ from past experience, Fifth Third could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase reserve.  

If Fifth Third does not appropriately adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer.  

Fifth Thirds ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers. In addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, Fifth Thirds competitors also include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and specialty finance, telecommunications, technology and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer. This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Fifth Third may make strategic investments and may expand an existing line of 

 business or enter into new lines of business to remain competitive. If it does not execute the appropriate strategies to effectively compete with or does not do so in an appropriate or timely manner its business may suffer. Additionally, these strategies, products and lines of business may bring with them unforeseeable or unforeseen risks and may not generate the expected results or returns, which could adversely affect Fifth Thirds results of operations or future growth prospects.  

If Fifth Third is unable to grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.  

The total amount that Fifth Third pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on Fifth Thirds ability to grow its deposits. If Fifth Third is unable to sufficiently grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. Fifth Third competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, Fifth Thirds funding costs may increase, either because Fifth Third raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because Fifth Third loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce Fifth Thirds net interest margin and net interest income. Fifth Thirds bank customers could take their money out of the Bank and put it in alternative investments, causing Fifth Third to lose a lower cost source of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.  

The Bancorps ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect its liquidity and ability to pay dividends.  

Fifth Third Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. Fifth Third Bancorp typically receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Fifth Third Bancorps stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that the Bancorps banking subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased since the financial crisis and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks such as the parent bank holding companies. Also, Fifth Third Bancorps right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors. Limitations on the Bancorps ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on stock or interest and principal on its debt. For further information refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect Fifth Thirds revenue and profitability.  

The financial services industry in which Fifth Third operates is highly competitive. Fifth Third competes not only with commercial banks, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, telecommunications and technology and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the internet. Fifth Third competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in Fifth Thirds competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. Fifth Third may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices.  

Fifth Third and/or the holders of its securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies.  

Fifth Thirds ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to Fifth Third, certain of its subsidiaries and particular classes of securities they issue. The interest rates that Fifth Third pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it, its subsidiaries and/or its securities receive from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to Fifth Third or its subsidiaries credit rating could affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to Fifth Third, its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities to Fifth Third under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase Fifth Thirds costs or otherwise have a negative effect on its results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Fifth Third or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.  

Fifth Third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.  

Fifth Thirds success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Fifth Third serves is great, which may increase Fifth Thirds expenses and may result in Fifth Third not being able to hire these candidates or retain them. If Fifth Third is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, Fifth Third may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition.  

Compensation paid by financial institutions such as Fifth Third has become increasingly regulated, particularly under the DFA, which regulation affects the amount and form of compensation Fifth Third pays to hire and retain talented employees. If Fifth Third is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, Fifth Thirds performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.  

Fifth Thirds mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter.  

Fifth Third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall, reducing the revenue Fifth Third receives from loan originations. At the same time, revenue from MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations tend to increase and the value of MSRs tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a natural hedge, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new 

 loans would accrue over time. It is also possible that even if interest rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.  

Fifth Third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. Fifth Third generally does not hedge all of its risks, and the fact that Fifth Third attempts to hedge any of the risks does not mean Fifth Third will be successful. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. Fifth Third may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. Fifth Third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities. There may be periods where Fifth Third elects not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.  

Fifth Third uses models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results.  

Fifth Third uses financial models to aid in its planning for various purposes including its capital and liquidity needs, potential charge-offs, reserves, and other purposes. The models used may not accurately account for all variables that could affect future results, may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. As a result of these potential failures, Fifth Third may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures.  

Changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of MSRs.  

Fifth Third acquires MSRs when it keeps the servicing rights after the sale or securitization of the loans that have been originated or when it purchases the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders. Fifth Third initially measures all residential MSRs at fair value and subsequently amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance.  

Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of MSRs can decrease. Each quarter Fifth Third evaluates the fair value of MSRs, and decreases in fair value below amortized cost reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs.  

The preparation of Fifth Thirds financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.  

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. If new information arises that results in a material change to a reserve amount, such a change could result in a change to previously announced financial results. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A for more information regarding managements significant estimates.  

Changes in accounting standards or interpretations could impact Fifth Thirds reported earnings and financial condition.  

The accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory agencies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Fifth Thirds consolidated financial statements.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how Fifth Third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Fifth Third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of Fifth Thirds prior period financial statements.  

Future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders ownership of Fifth Third and may cause Fifth Third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events.  

Future business acquisitions could be material to Fifth Third and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require Fifth Third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, Fifth Third could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.  

Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with Fifth Thirds own operations may prevent Fifth Third from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  

Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Fifth Third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which Fifth Third and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. Fifth Third may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and integration activities may require Fifth Third to devote substantial time and resources and as a result Fifth Third may not be able to pursue other business opportunities.  

After completing an acquisition, Fifth Third may find certain items are not accounted for properly in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards. Fifth Third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, Fifth Third could experience higher charge-offs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio.  

Fifth Third may sell or consider selling one or more of its businesses. Should it determine to sell such a business, it may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in shareholders equity commensurate with desirable levels. Moreover, if Fifth Third sold such businesses, the loss of income could have an adverse effect on its earnings and future growth.  

Fifth Third owns, or owns a minority stake in, as applicable, several non-strategic businesses that are not significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses. Fifth Third has, from time to time, considered and undertaken (and, in the case of Vantiv, has announced its intention to continue) the sale of such businesses and/or interests, including, for example, portions of Fifth Thirds stake in Vantiv Holding, LLC. If it were to determine to sell such businesses and/or interests, Fifth Third would be subject to market forces that may make completion of a sale unsuccessful or may not be able to do so within a desirable time frame. If Fifth Third were to complete the sale of any of its businesses and/or interests in third parties, it would suffer the loss of income from the sold businesses and/or interests, including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth. Additionally, Fifth Third may encounter difficulties in separating the operations of any businesses it sells, which may affect its business or results of operations. 

Fifth Third relies on its systems and certain service providers, and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations.  

Fifth Third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both Fifth Third and third party service providers. Fifth Third has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the systems will not be inoperable. Fifth Third also has security to prevent unauthorized access to the systems. In addition, Fifth Third requires its third party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, Fifth Third cannot be certain that the measures will be successful. A security breach in the systems and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in losing the customers confidence and thus the loss of their business as well as additional significant costs for privacy monitoring activities.  

Fifth Thirds necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume poses the risk that technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. Fifth Third may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages).  

Third parties with which the Bancorp does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which the Bancorps customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Bancorp, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Bancorps security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Bancorps customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Bancorp to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Bancorp or its customers, thereby increasing the Bancorps operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Bancorps possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Bancorp could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Bancorps systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties. The Bancorp may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Bancorps control, which may include, for example, security breaches; electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Bancorps property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. While the Bancorp believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Bancorp or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Bancorps systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Bancorps business and results of operations by subjecting the Bancorp to losses or liability, or require the Bancorp to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Bancorp to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.

Fifth Third is exposed to cyber-security risks, including denial of service, hacking, and identity theft.  

Fifth Third relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect its customer relationships. While Fifth Third has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, by both private individuals and foreign governments. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, Fifth Third may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Furthermore, there has been a well-publicized series of apparently related distributed denial of service attacks on large financial services companies, including Fifth Third Bank. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. These events adversely affected the performance of Fifth Thirds website and in some instances prevented customers from accessing Fifth Thirds website. Future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and Fifth Third may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Fifth Third may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks or in the investigation of such cyber-attacks or related to the protection of the Bancorps customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. Despite this effort, the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of Fifth Thirds systems or third-party service providers, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could also seriously damage Fifth Thirds reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.  

Fifth Third is exposed to operational and reputational risk.  

Fifth Third is exposed to many types of operational risk, including but not limited to, business continuity risk, information management risk, fraud risk, model risk, third party service provider risk, human resources risk, and process risk.  

Fifth Thirds actual or alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, corporate governance and acquisitions, may result in negative public opinion and may damage Fifth Thirds reputation. Actions taken by government regulators and community organizations may also damage Fifth Thirds reputation. Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the advent and expansion of social media facilitates the rapid dissemination of information. Though Fifth Third monitors social media channels, the potential remains for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information that could damage Fifth Thirds reputation. Negative public opinion can 

 adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to attract and keep customers and can increase the risk that it will be a target of litigation and regulatory action.  

The results of Vantiv Holding, LLC could have a negative impact on Fifth Thirds operating results and financial condition.  

In 2009, Fifth Third sold an approximate 51% interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC (formerly Fifth Third Processing Solutions). As a result of additional share sales completed by Fifth Third in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Bancorp ownership share in Vantiv Holding, LLC as of December 31, 2015, is approximately 18%. The Bancorps investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC is currently accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is not consolidated based on Fifth Thirds remaining ownership share in Vantiv Holding, LLC. Vantiv Holding, LLCs operating results could be poor and could negatively affect the operating results of Fifth Third. In addition, Fifth Third owns a warrant to acquire approximately 7.8 million Class C non-voting units of Vantiv Holding, LLC. Fifth Third participates in a multi-lender credit facility to Vantiv Holding, LLC and repayment of these loans is contingent on the future cash flows of Vantiv Holding, LLC.  

Changes in Fifth Thirds ownership in Vantiv Holding, LLC could have an impact on Fifth Thirds stock price, operating results, financial condition, and future outlook.  

Fifth Third expects that it will reduce its equity and derivative investments in Vantiv Holding, LLC and its publicly traded parent, Vantiv, Inc., in whole or in part, but there can be no assurance that such sales will occur or as to when they will occur or the value that might be received by Fifth Third. A reduction in Fifth Thirds Vantiv ownership interest may result from a series of sale transactions similar to transactions in Vantiv securities engaged in by Fifth Third to date, or could occur as a result of one or more larger transactions, depending on strategic considerations, market conditions, or other factors deemed important by Fifth Third. Additionally, Fifth Thirds ownership in Vantiv could be affected by transactions that Vantiv may undertake. The nature, terms, and timing of transactions engaged in by Vantiv may not be entirely within Fifth Thirds control, if at all. If and when Fifth Thirds ownership in Vantiv is reduced, such changes in ownership could have a material impact, positive or negative, on Fifth Thirds stock price, operating results, financial condition and future outlook.  

Weather related events or other natural disasters may have an effect on the performance of Fifth Thirds loan portfolios, especially in its coastal markets, thereby adversely impacting its results of operations.  

Fifth Thirds footprint stretches from the upper Midwestern to lower Southeastern regions of the United States. These regions have experienced weather events including hurricanes and other natural disasters. The nature and level of these events and the impact of global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be predicted. If large scale events occur, they may significantly impact its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as well as impairing its borrowers ability to repay their loans.

RISKS RELATED TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  

As a regulated entity, the Bancorp is subject to certain capital requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth.  

The Bancorp is a bank holding company and a financial holding company. As such, it is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. The Bancorp must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by the FRB which can change depending upon general economic conditions and the Bancorps particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect the Bancorps ability to expand or maintain present business levels.  

In July 2013, the Federal banking agencies issued final rules for the enhanced regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations, which implemented aspects of Basel III. The final rules provide the option for certain banking organizations, including the Bancorp, to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital and retain the treatment of residential mortgage exposures consistent with the current Basel I capital rules. The new capital rules became effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity could limit Fifth Thirds business activities, including lending, and the ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases and share repurchases.  

The Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed and maintain at least a Satisfactory CRA rating for the Bancorp to retain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet these requirements could result in the FRB placing limitations or conditions on the Bancorps activities (and the commencement of new activities, including merger with or acquisitions of other financial institutions) and could ultimately result in the loss of financial holding company status. The FRB conducted a regularly scheduled examination covering 2011 through 2013 to determine the Bancorps banking subsidiarys compliance with the CRA. Although the FRB has not made a final determination, the Bancorp believes that the results of such CRA examination may result in a rating of Needs to Improve. If that would occur, such rating would last at least until the Bancorps banking subsidiarys next CRA examination.  

In addition, failure by the Bancorps banking subsidiary to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.  

Fifth Thirds business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.  

Previous economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry. The U.S. government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, by 

 introducing various actions and passing legislation such as the DFA. Such programs and legislation subject Fifth Third and other financial institutions to restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on Fifth Thirds business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of its common stock.  

New proposals for legislation and regulations continue to be introduced that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry. Fifth Third cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on Fifth Third. Additional regulation could affect Fifth Third in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Fifth Third is subject to various regulatory requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth.  

Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions and their holding companies, the FRB, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions by Fifth Third and its banking subsidiary. Fifth Third and its banking subsidiary are subject to such supervisory authority and, more generally, must, in certain instances, obtain prior regulatory approval before engaging in certain activities or corporate decisions. There can be no assurance that such approvals, if required, would be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely manner. Failure to receive any such approval, if required, could limit or impair Fifth Thirds operations, restrict its growth and/or affect its dividend policy. Such actions and activities subject to prior approval include, but are not limited to, increasing dividends paid by Fifth Third or its banking subsidiary, entering into a merger or acquisition transaction, acquiring or establishing new branches, and entering into certain new businesses.  

In addition, Fifth Third, as well as other financial institutions more generally, have recently been subjected to increased scrutiny from government authorities, including bank regulatory authorities, stemming from broader systemic regulatory concerns, including with respect to stress testing, capital levels, asset quality, provisioning, AML/BSA, consumer compliance and other prudential matters and efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future crises. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are also pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.  

In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, which restrict or limit a financial institution. Finally, as part of Fifth Thirds regular examination process, Fifth Thirds and its banking subsidiarys respective regulators may advise it and its banking subsidiary to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Such supervisory actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could negatively affect Fifth Thirds ability to engage in new activities and certain transactions, as well as have a material adverse effect on Fifth Thirds business and results of operations and may not be publicly disclosed.

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.  

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding their respective businesses. Such matters may result in material adverse consequences, including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Thirds SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures.  

Deposit insurance premiums levied against Fifth Third Bank may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of resolving failed banks increases.  

The FDIC maintains a DIF to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including Fifth Third Bank. Under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011, regular assessment rates for all banks will decline when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, which the FDIC expects will occur in early 2016. In October 2015, the FDIC issued a proposed rule which would impose on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, such as Fifth Third, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The Bancorp estimates the impact of these changes will increase Fifth Thirds FDIC premiums by approximately $25 million per year. Future deposit premiums paid by Fifth Third Bank depend on FDIC rules, which are subject to change, the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Fifth Third Bank may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums if market developments change such that the DIF balance is reduced or the FDIC changes its rules to require higher premiums.  

Fifth Third is subject to extensive governmental regulation which could adversely impact Fifth Third or the businesses in which Fifth Third is engaged.  

Fifth Third is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which Fifth Third may engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers and depositors. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact Fifth Third or its ability to increase the value of its business. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against Fifth Third could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws, including tax laws, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to Fifth Third and its shareholders or may require Fifth Third to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements.  

 The DFA, enacted in 2010, is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented. The DFA established the CFPB which has authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their affiliates for compliance with Federal consumer protection laws. Since its formation, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that could have a significant impact on Fifth Thirds business and the financial services industry more generally including integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth 

 in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Compliance with the rules and policies adopted by the CFPB may limit the products Fifth Third may permissibly offer to customers, or limit the terms on which those products may be issued, or may adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to conduct its business as previously conducted. Fifth Third may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Fifth Thirds business, results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.  

The reforms, both under the DFA and otherwise, are having a significant effect on the entire financial industry. Fifth Third believes compliance with the DFA and implementing its regulations and other initiatives will likely continue to negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit Fifth Thirds ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to Fifth Thirds businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that Fifth Third deals with in the course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. The extent to which Fifth Third can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not known at this time.  

Conforming Covered Activities to the Volcker Rule may require the expenditure of resources and management attention.  

The DFA Volcker Rule provisions implementing the final rule generally restrict banks and their affiliated entities from investing in or sponsoring certain private equity and hedge funds. Fifth Third does not sponsor any private equity or hedge funds that it is prohibited from sponsoring. As of December 31, 2015, the Bancorp had approximately $186 million in interests and approximately $37 million in binding commitments to invest in private equity funds likely to be affected by the Volcker Rule. It is expected that the Bancorp may need to dispose of these investments although it is likely that these investments will be reduced over time in the ordinary course before compliance is required. In December 2014, the FRB extended the conformance period through July 2016 for investments in and relationships with such covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and announced its intention to grant a one year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. An ultimate forced sale of some of these investments could result in Fifth Third receiving less value than it would otherwise have received.

If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bank holding company or non-bank financial company were triggered, Fifth Third could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund.  

The DFA creates authority for the orderly liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies and is based on the FDICs bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the President of the United States and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the Orderly Liquidation Fund established under the DFA, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as Fifth Third. Any such assessments may adversely affect Fifth Thirds business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Regulation of Fifth Third by the CFTC imposes additional operational and compliance costs.  

Title VII of DFA imposes a new regulatory regime on the U.S. derivatives markets. While most of the provisions related to derivatives markets are now in effect, several additional requirements await final regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for derivatives, the CFTC and the SEC. One aspect of this new regulatory regime for derivatives is that substantial oversight responsibility has been provided to the CFTC, which, as a result, now has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of Fifth Thirds businesses. In 2014, Fifth Third Bank registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became subject to new substantive requirements, including real time trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required to be cleared. Although the ultimate impact will depend on the promulgation of all final regulations, Fifth Thirds derivatives business will likely be further subject to new substantive requirements, including margin requirements in excess of current market practice and capital requirements specific to this business. These requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on Fifth Third and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). Once finalized, the rules may raise the costs and liquidity burden associated with Fifth Thirds derivatives businesses and adversely affect or cause Fifth Third to change its derivatives products.  

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become the subject of litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to Fifth Thirds reputation.  

Fifth Third and certain of its directors and officers have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to Fifth Thirds business and activities. Past, present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. The SEC may seek admissions of liability when settling cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. These matters could result in material 

 adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief, amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Thirds SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures. Like other large financial institutions and companies, Fifth Third is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Fifth Third could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business.  

Fifth Thirds ability to pay or increase dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its capital stock is restricted.  

Fifth Thirds ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock is subject to regulatory requirements and the need to meet regulatory expectations. Fifth Third is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB as part of CCAR. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the expected use and sources of capital over the planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the Bancorps business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed description of the Bancorps process for assessing capital adequacy and the Bancorps capital policy. Fifth Thirds stress testing results and 2016 capital plan will be submitted to the FRB by April 5, 2016.  

The FRBs review of the capital plan will assess the comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan. Additionally, the FRB will review the robustness of the capital adequacy process, the capital policy and the Bancorps ability to maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a CET1 ratio of 5% under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS  

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity.  

Table 9 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities included in other assets. Table 10 provides the relative impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net interest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in the net interest rate spread, changes made to the Bancorps deposit advance product beginning January 1, 2015 and an increase in average long-term debt of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in average taxable securities and average loans and leases of $5.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The net interest rate spread decreased to 2.69% during the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.94% in 2014 driven by a 21 bps decrease in yields on average interest-earning assets coupled with a 3 bps increase in the rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities.  

Net interest margin on an FTE basis was 2.88% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.10% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease from December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the previously mentioned decrease in the net interest rate spread coupled with a $7.6 billion increase in average interest-earning assets partially offset by an increase in average free funding balances. The increase in average free funding balances was driven by increases in average demand deposits and average shareholders equity of $3.4 billion and $572 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Interest income on an FTE basis from loans and leases decreased $147 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease of 24 bps in yields on average loans and leases partially offset by an increase of 2% in average loans and leases. The decrease in yields for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $93 million decline in interest income on other consumer loans and leases primarily due to changes made to the Bancorps deposit advance product beginning January 1, 2015. The decrease also included decreases in yields on average commercial and industrial loans, average residential mortgage loans and average automobile loans of 14 bps, 19 bps and 11 bps, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in average loans and 

 leases for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by increases in average commercial loans and leases and average residential mortgage loans. For more information on the Bancorps loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $145 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase in average taxable securities.  

Interest expense on core deposits decreased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a decline in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits more than offset an increase in average interest-bearing core deposits. The cost of average interest-bearing core deposits decreased to 24 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 27 bps for the year ended December 31, 2014. Average interest-bearing core deposits increased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in average money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorps deposits.  

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in average long-term debt coupled with a 18 bps increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorps borrowings. During both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, average wholesale funding represented 24% of average interest-bearing liabilities. For more information on the Bancorps interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.

 (a)  Changes in interest not solely due to volume or yield/rate are allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amount of change in volume and yield/rate.  

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses  

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets is referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.  

The provision for loan and lease losses was $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $315 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year 

 was primarily due to the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007, a broadening global economic slowdown, stress on capital markets and the prolonged softness in commodity prices. The ALLL declined $50 million from December 31, 2014 to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.37%, compared to 1.47% at December 31, 2014.  

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses, including an analysis of loan portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the ALLL.

Noninterest Income  

Noninterest income increased $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table presents the components of noninterest income:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Service charges on deposits  

Service charges on deposits increased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to a $3 million increase in commercial deposit fees. The increase in commercial deposit fees was driven by an increase in activity from existing customers and new customer acquisition.  

Investment advisory revenue  

Investment advisory revenue increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $6 million in recurring securities brokerage fees driven by higher sales volume and an increase of $5 million in private client service fees due to an increase in personal asset management fees. The Bancorp had approximately $297 billion and $308 billion in total assets under care as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and managed $26 billion and $27 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and 

 not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Corporate banking revenue  

Corporate banking revenue decreased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease from the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in syndication and lease remarketing fees. Syndication fees decreased $29 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of decreased activity in the market and the Bancorps reduced leveraged loan appetite. The decrease in lease remarketing fees included the impact of impairment charges of $36 million related to certain operating lease equipment that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decreases for the year ended December 31, 2015 were partially offset by higher institutional sales revenue and gains on the sale of operating lease equipment. 

Mortgage banking net revenue  

Mortgage banking net revenue increased $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table presents the components of mortgage banking net revenue:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as the result of an 11% increase in residential mortgage loan originations. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $8.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to strong refinancing activity that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Net mortgage servicing revenue is comprised of gross mortgage servicing fees and related MSR amortization as well as 

 valuation adjustments on MSRs and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. Net mortgage servicing revenue increased $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by an increase of $64 million in net valuation adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees of $24 million and an increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization of $20 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table presents the components of net valuation adjustments on the MSR portfolio and the impact of the non-qualifying hedging strategy for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused the modeled prepayment speeds to slow, and led to the recovery of temporary impairment on servicing rights during the year. Mortgage rates decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 which caused the modeled prepayments speeds to increase, which led to temporary impairment on servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Servicing rights are deemed impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate. Further detail on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation on the MSR portfolio. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio.  

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp may acquire various 

 securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp did not sell securities related to the non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net gains on the sale of these securities were $13 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, recorded in securities gains, net - non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

The Bancorps total residential mortgage loans serviced as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $73.4 billion and $79.0 billion, respectively, with $59.0 billion and $65.4 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others.  

Card and processing revenue  

Card and processing revenue increased $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of actively used cards and an increase in customer spend volume. Debit card interchange revenue, included in card and processing revenue, was $137 million and $128 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Other noninterest income  

The following table presents the major components of other noninterest income:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other noninterest income increased $529 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a gain of $125 million in 2014. The positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $236 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fair value of the stock warrant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing 

 model, which utilizes several key inputs (Vantiv, Inc. stock price, strike price of the warrant and several unobservable inputs). The positive valuation adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to increases of 40% and 4%, respectively, in Vantiv, Inc.s share price from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 and from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $49 million from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the TRA and also recognized a gain of $31 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $23 million associated with the TRA during the fourth quarter of 2014.  

In addition to the increases discussed above, gain on loan sales increased $38 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a $37 million gain on the sale of certain residential mortgage loans classified as TDRs during the first quarter of 2015. Equity method 

 earnings from the Bancorps interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $15 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as 2014 included charges taken by Vantiv Holding, LLC related to an acquisition during 2014.  

The year ended December 31, 2015 also included impairment charges, included in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment in other noninterest income of $109 million compared to $20 million for the same period in the prior year. For more information on these impairment charges, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest Expense  

Noninterest expense increased $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increases in personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits), technology and communications and card and processing expense partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. The following table presents the major components of noninterest expense:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Personnel costs increased $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by higher executive retirement and severance costs as well as an increase in base compensation and an increase in incentive compensation, primarily in the mortgage business. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 18,261 at December 31, 2015 compared to 18,351 at December 31, 2014.  

Technology and communications expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year 

 ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance and other growth initiatives.  

Card and processing expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased fraud prevention related expenses. 

The following table presents the major components of other noninterest expense:

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Other noninterest expense decreased $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in losses and adjustments partially offset by increases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, marketing expense, donations expense, impairment on affordable housing investments, FDIC insurance and other taxes and operating lease expense.  

Losses and adjustments decreased $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in legal settlements and reserve expense. The provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments increased $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in unfunded commitments for which the Bancorp holds reserves. Marketing expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Donations expense increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by contributions of $14 million to the Fifth Third 

 Foundation. Impairment on affordable housing investments increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to incremental losses resulting from previous growth in the portfolio. FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in the assessment rate due to a change in asset mix as well as an increase in the assessment base. Operating lease expense increased $7 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to an increase in depreciation on operating lease equipment.  

The Bancorp continues to focus on efficiency initiatives as part of its core emphasis on operating leverage and expense control. The efficiency ratio (noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (FTE) and noninterest income) was 57.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

Applicable Income Taxes  

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and certain gains on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits, partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of the IRC.  

The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily impacted by $178 million and $164 million, respectively, in tax credits and $39 million and $27 million of tax benefits from tax-exempt income in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to an increase in income before income taxes partially offset by the increased amount of tax credits.  

As required under U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp established a deferred tax asset for stock-based awards granted to its employees 

 and directors. When the actual tax deduction for these stock-based awards is less than the expense previously recognized for financial reporting or when the awards expire unexercised and where the Bancorp has not accumulated an excess tax benefit for previously exercised or released stock-based awards, the Bancorp is required to recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense upon the write-off of the deferred tax asset previously established for these stock-based awards. As the Bancorp had an accumulated excess tax benefit at December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bancorp was not required to recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

Based on the Bancorps stock price at December 31, 2015 and the Bancorps accumulation of an excess tax benefit through the period ended December 31, 2015, the Bancorp does not believe it will be required to recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense over the next twelve months related to stock-based awards. However, the Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether its employees will exercise other stock-based awards with lower exercise prices in the future. Therefore, it is possible the Bancorp may be required to recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense in the future. 

The following table presents the Bancorps income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate:

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW  

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. Additional financial information on each business segment is included in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices or businesses change.  

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level and employs an FTP methodology at the business segment level. This methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through loan and deposit products. The FTP system assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on expected duration and the U.S. swap curve. Matching duration allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from interest rate risk. In a rising rate environment, the Bancorp benefits from the widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale funding costs. However, the Bancorps FTP system credits this benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as Branch Banking and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The net impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. 

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by review of the estimated durations for the indeterminate-lived deposits. The credit rate provided for demand deposit accounts is reviewed annually based upon the account type, its estimated duration and the corresponding federal funds, U.S. swap curve or swap rate. The credit rates for several deposit products were reset January 1, 2015 to reflect the current market rates and updated duration assumptions. These rates were generally lower than those in place during 2014, thus net interest income for deposit-providing businesses was negatively impacted during 2015.  

The business segments are charged provision expense based on the actual net charge-offs experienced on the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors are captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.  

The results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were adjusted to reflect the transfer of certain customers and Bancorp employees from Commercial Banking to Branch Banking, effective January 1, 2015. In addition, the balances for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were adjusted to reflect a change in internal allocation methodology.

Net income was $739 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net income of $800 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net income was the result of an increase in noninterest expense coupled with a decrease in noninterest income.  

Net interest income decreased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a decline in yields of 19 bps on average commercial loans and leases and increases in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances. These decreases for the year ended December 31, 2015 were partially offset by increases in FTP credits on core deposits driven by increases in average balances.  

Provision for loan and lease losses increased $4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase included a $102 million charge-off during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007. The year ended December 31, 2014 included net charge-offs related to certain impaired commercial and industrial loans in the first and third quarters of 2014.

 Noninterest income decreased $27 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to a decrease in corporate banking revenue partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income. Corporate banking revenue decreased $51 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by decreases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. The decrease in syndication fees was the result of decreased activity in the market and the Bancorps reduced leveraged loan appetite. The decrease in 

 lease remarketing fees included the impact of impairment charges of $36 million related to certain operating lease equipment that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The decrease in corporate banking revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by higher institutional sales revenue. Other noninterest income increased $20 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by increases in gains on loan sales.  

Noninterest expense increased $85 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by an increase in other noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations, operating lease expense and impairment on affordable housing investments.  

Average commercial loans increased $2.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans increased $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in new loan origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and targeted marketing efforts. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $552 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.  

Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was the result of growth in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits which increased $2.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $860 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The decrease in mortgage banking net revenue was due to a $293 million decline in mortgage origination fees and gains on loan sales due to a decline in mortgage originations and a $90 million decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue. The decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $16 million decrease in securities gains.

Average consumer loans and leases decreased $1.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2013. Average residential mortgage 

 loans decreased $1.4 billion from the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to a decline of $1.5 billion in average residential mortgage loans held for sale from reduced origination volumes driven by a reduction in refinance activity and the exit of the broker origination channel during 2014.

Net interest income decreased $24 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to business segments driven by increases in average deposits. The remaining decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense on long-term debt and a decrease in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases partially offset by an increase in interest income on taxable securities. Results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were impacted by a benefit of $50 million compared to a benefit of $260 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to reductions in the ALLL.

Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was an expense of $64 million compared to a benefit of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and an increase in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, donations expense, technology and communications expense and marketing expense. 

 The increase was partially offset by decreased litigation and regulatory activity and increased corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

The Bancorps 2015 fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $634 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $366 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2015 and net income available to common shareholders of $362 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis was $904 million during the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 and increased $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease from the third quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by the impact of the issuance of $2.4 billion of long-term debt during the third quarter of 2015, the $750 million auto securitization completed in November of 2015 and commercial loan yield compression, partially offset by higher average loan balances. The increase in net interest income in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2014 was driven by higher investment securities balances, partially offset by a decline due to changes to the Bancorps deposit advance product beginning January 1, 2015.  

Fourth quarter 2015 noninterest income of $1.1 billion increased $391 million compared to the third quarter of 2015 and increased $451 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase from the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to an increase in other noninterest income. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of increases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by lower corporate banking revenue.  

Service charges on deposits of $144 million decreased $1 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease from the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in retail service charges due to lower overdraft occurrences. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2014 was driven by an increase in commercial service charges due to an increase in activity from existing customers and new customer acquisition.  

Corporate banking revenue of $104 million was flat compared to the previous quarter and decreased $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower loan syndications revenue, foreign exchange fees and business lending fees, partially offset by higher lease remarketing and institutional sales revenue. The decrease in syndication fees from the fourth quarter of 2014 was the result of decreased activity in the market and the Bancorps reduced leveraged loan appetite.  

Mortgage banking net revenue was $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $71 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 originations were $1.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in the previous quarter and $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 originations resulted in gains of $37 million on mortgages sold, compared with gains of $46 million during the previous quarter and $36 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease from the prior quarter was driven by lower production due to an increase in interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase from the prior year was due to stronger refinancing activity during the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross mortgage servicing fees were $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, $54 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include MSR amortization and MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. These net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million and negative $29 million in the fourth and third 

 quarters of 2015, respectively, and negative $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased $1 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline from the third quarter of 2015 was due to a decrease in securities and brokerage fees. The year-over-year increase was due to an increase in private client services revenue.  

Card and processing revenue of $77 million was flat compared to the third quarter of 2015 and increased $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase from the prior year was driven by an increase in the number of actively used cards and an increase in customer spend volume.  

Other noninterest income of $602 million increased $389 million compared to the third quarter of 2015 and increased $452 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 results included a $331 million gain on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares, an $89 million gain on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv, Holding, LLC, a $49 million gain from a payment received from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the TRA, a $31 million gain from Vantiv, Inc. pursuant to the TRA and a $21 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv Holding, LLC warrant. This compares with a $130 million positive warrant valuation adjustment in the third quarter of 2015, and a $56 million positive warrant valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as $23 million in gains pursuant to Fifth Thirds TRA with Vantiv Holding, LLC recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. Quarterly results also included charges related to the valuation of the total return swap entered into as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Negative valuation adjustments on this swap were $10 million, $8 million and $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively.  

The net gains on investment securities were $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. There were no net gains on investment securities during the third quarter of 2015.  

Noninterest expense of $963 million increased $20 million from the previous quarter and increased $45 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in noninterest expense compared to the third quarter of 2015 was driven by a $10 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation and higher net occupancy expense. The increase in noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation, higher personnel costs, net occupancy expense and technology and communications expense.  

The ALLL as a percentage of portfolio loans and leases was 1.37% as of December 31, 2015, compared to 1.35% as of September 30, 2015 and 1.47% as of December 31, 2014. The provision for loan and lease losses was $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $156 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $99 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net charge-offs were $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, or 34 bps of average portfolio loans and leases on an annualized basis, compared with net charge-offs of $188 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The third quarter of 2015 included a charge-off of $102 million associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Bancorp transferred certain residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to held for sale resulting in a charge-off of $87 million.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2014 WITH 2013  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.4 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, which was net of $67 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.8 billion, or $2.02 per diluted share, which was net of $37 million in preferred stock dividends. The provision for loan and lease losses increased to $315 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $229 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as the result of an increase in net charge-offs related to certain impaired commercial and industrial loans and an increase in net charge-offs loans related to the transfer of certain residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to held for sale during 2014. The impact of these increases in charge-offs on provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by decreases in nonperforming loans and leases and improved delinquency metrics. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 0.64% during 2014 compared to 0.58% during the year ended December 31, 2013.  

Net interest income was $3.6 billion for both of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net interest income was positively impacted by an increase in average taxable securities of $5.4 billion coupled with an increase in yields on these securities of 16 bps compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Net interest income also included the benefit of an increase in average loans and leases of $2.0 billion as well as a decrease in the rates paid on long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. These benefits were partially offset by lower yields on loans and leases and an increase in average long-term debt of $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.  

 Noninterest income decreased $754 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease from December 31, 2013 was primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking net revenue and other noninterest income. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $390 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in origination fees and gains on loan sales and net mortgage servicing revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $429 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $125 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the second quarter of 2014, compared to gains totaling $327 million during the second and third quarters of 2013. The Bancorp recognized gains of $23 million and $9 million associated with the TRA with Vantiv, Inc. in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, other noninterest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $31 million during 2014 

 compared to positive valuation adjustments of $206 million during 2013 and a decrease in equity method earnings from Vantiv Holding, LLC.  

Noninterest expense decreased $252 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in total personnel costs and other noninterest expense. The decrease in total personnel costs was driven by a decrease in incentive compensation primarily in the mortgage business due to lower production levels and a decrease in base compensation and employee benefits as a result of a decline in the number of full-time equivalent employees. Other noninterest expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in loan and lease expense, FDIC insurance and other taxes, losses and adjustments, marketing expense, debt extinguishment costs and an increase in the benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments, partially offset by an increase in impairment on affordable housing investments.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS  

Loans and Leases  

The Bancorp classifies its commercial loans and leases based upon their primary purpose and consumer loans and leases based upon product or collateral. Table 24 summarizes end of period loans and 

 leases, including loans held for sale and Table 25 summarizes average total loans and leases, including loans held for sale. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loans and leases, including loans held for sale, increased $2.1 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2014. The increase in loans and leases from December 31, 2014 was the result of a $2.2 billion, or 4%, increase in commercial loans and leases partially offset by a $67 million decrease in consumer loans and leases.  

Commercial loans and leases increased from December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in commercial and industrial loans and commercial construction loans partially offset by a decrease in commercial mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans increased $1.4 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2014 and commercial construction loans increased $1.1 billion, or 55%, from December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in new loan origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and targeted marketing efforts. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $419 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to a 

 decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.  

Consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2014 primarily due to decreases in home equity and automobile loans partially offset by increases in residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans and leases. Home equity decreased $550 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2014 and automobile loans decreased $540 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2014 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Residential mortgage loans increased $842 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to the continued retention of certain conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2015. Other consumer loans and leases increased $222 million, or 51%, from December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in new loan origination activity. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average loans and leases, including loans held for sale, increased $2.2 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2014. The increase from December 31, 2014 was the result of a $2.2 billion, or 4%, increase in average commercial loans and leases partially offset by a $16 million decrease in average consumer loans and leases. 

Average commercial loans and leases increased from December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Average commercial and industrial loans increased $1.4 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2014 and average commercial construction loans increased $1.2 billion, or 82%, from December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in new loan origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and targeted marketing efforts. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $624 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2014 due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.  

Average consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2014 primarily due to decreases in average home equity and average automobile loans partially offset by increases in average 

 residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans and leases. Average home equity decreased $467 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2014 and average automobile loans decreased $221 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2014 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Average residential mortgage loans increased $454 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2014 primarily driven by the continued retention of certain conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans. Average other consumer loans and leases increased $186 million, or 48%, from December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in new loan origination activity. 

Investment Securities  

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing liquidity support and providing collateral for pledging purposes. As of December 31, 2015, total investment securities were $29.5 billion compared to $23.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The taxable investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.1 years at December 31, 2015 compared to 4.5 years at December 31, 2014.  

At December 31, 2015, the Bancorps investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale securities. Securities classified as below investment grade were immaterial as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Bancorps management has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the 

 available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios for OTTI. The Bancorp recognized $5 million, $24 million and $74 million of OTTI on its available-for-sale and other debt securities, included in securities gains, net and securities gains, net  non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Bancorp did not recognize OTTI on any of its available-for-sale equity securities or held-to-maturity debt securities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bancorps methodology for both classifying investment securities and managements evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Equity securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at par, FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock holdings and certain mutual fund holdings and equity security holdings.  

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities increased $7.0 billion, or 32%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to repositioning of the portfolio for LCR purposes resulting in increases in agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Agency residential mortgage-backed securities increased $2.8 billion, or 24%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to the purchase of $18.8 billion of agency residential mortgage-backed securities partially offset by sales of $13.6 billion 

 and paydowns of $2.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities increased $3.3 billion, or 75%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to the purchase of $5.6 billion of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities partially offset by sales of $2.1 billion and paydowns of $146 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities increased $1.3 billion, or 88%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to the purchase of $1.9 billion of non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities partially offset by sales of $483 million and paydowns of $105 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities were 23% and 18% of total interest-earning assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale and other portfolio was 6.4 years at December 31, 2015 compared to 5.8 years at December 31, 2014. In addition, at December 31, 2015, the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.19% compared to 3.31% at December 31, 2014.  

Information presented in Table 27 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is 

 presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale and other portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio were $366 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $731 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease from December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and wider spreads during the year ended December 31, 2015. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Taxable-equivalent yield adjustments included in the above table are 0.00%, 0.24%, 2.09% and 1.46% for securities with an average life of 1 year or less, 1-5 years, 5-10 years and in total, respectively.

Deposits  

The Bancorps deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises 

 by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Core deposits represented 71% of the Bancorps average asset funding base for both of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Core deposits increased $1.8 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2014, driven by an increase of $1.7 billion, or 2%, in transaction deposits. Transaction deposits increased from December 31, 2014 due to increases in demand deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in savings deposits and foreign office deposits. Demand deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher balances per customer account and the acquisition of new commercial customers. Money market deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 8%, from December 31, 2014 driven primarily by higher balances per commercial account and the acquisition of new commercial customers. The remaining 

 increase in money market deposits was due to a promotional product offering causing balance migration from savings deposits which decreased $450 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2014. Foreign office deposits decreased $650 million, or 58%, from December 31, 2014 driven primarily by lower balances per commercial account.  

The Bancorp uses certificates $100,000 and over as a method to fund earning assets. At December 31, 2015, certificates $100,000 and over decreased $303 million, or 10%, compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2014. 

The following table presents the components of average deposits for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On an average basis, core deposits increased $5.8 billion, or 6%, compared to December 31, 2014 due to increases of $5.5 billion, or 6%, in average transaction deposits and $289 million, or 8%, in average other time deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven by increases in average money market deposits, average demand deposits and average interest checking deposits, partially offset by decreases in average savings deposits and average foreign office deposits. Average money market deposits increased $3.5 billion, or 24%, from December 31, 2014 due to a balance migration from average savings deposits which decreased $1.1 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2014 driven by a promotional product offering. The remaining increase in average money market deposits was due to an increase in average commercial account balances and the acquisition of new commercial customers. Average demand deposits increased $3.4 billion, or 11%, from December 31, 

 2014 primarily due to an increase in average commercial account balances and new commercial customer accounts. Average interest checking deposits increased $778 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in average commercial account balances and new commercial customer accounts. Average foreign office deposits decreased $1.0 billion, or 55%, from December 31, 2014 primarily due to lower balances per account for commercial customers. Average other time deposits increased $289 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2014 primarily driven by the acquisition of new customers due to promotional interest rates. Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $1.1 billion, or 27%, from December 31, 2014 due primarily to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2014.

Total borrowings increased $835 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2014. Table 32 summarizes the end of period components of 

 total borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, total borrowings as a percentage of interest-bearing liabilities were 21% compared to 20% at December 31, 2014. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other short-term borrowings decreased $49 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in commercial repurchase agreements. Long-term debt increased $877 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2014 primarily driven by issuances of $1.1 billion of unsecured senior notes, $1.3 billion of unsecured senior bank notes and the issuance of asset-backed securities by a consolidated VIE of $750 million related to an automobile loan 

 securitization in 2015. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of $500 million of subordinated fixed-rate bank notes and $1.7 billion of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations. For additional information regarding automobile securitizations and long-term debt, refer to Note 11 and Note 16, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total borrowings increased $2.1 billion, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2014, due to increases in average long-term debt and average federal funds purchased, partially offset by a decrease in average other short-term borrowings. The increase in average long-term debt of $1.7 billion, or 14%, was driven primarily by the issuances of long-term debt as discussed above and the issuance of asset-backed securities by a consolidated VIE of $1.0 billion related to an automobile loan securitization during the fourth quarter of 2014. The impact of these issuances was partially offset by the aforementioned maturity of subordinated fixed-rate bank notes and paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations since December 31, 2014. The level of average federal funds purchased and average other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on 

 funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those needs. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is presented in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorps liquidity management.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW  

Managing risk is an essential component of successfully operating a financial services company. The Bancorps risk management approach includes processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The ERM division, led by the Bancorps Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistency and adequacy of the Bancorps risk management approach within the structure of the Bancorps operating model. Management within the lines of business and support functions assess and manage risks associated with their activities and determine if actions need to be taken to strengthen risk management or reduce risk given their risk profile. They are responsible for considering risk when making business decisions and for integrating risk management into business processes. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes.  

The assumption of risk requires robust and active risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of activities, measures and strategies that apply to the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk Appetite Framework, approved by the Board, that provides the foundations of corporate risk capacity, risk appetite and risk tolerances. The Bancorps risk capacity is represented by its available financial resources. Risk capacity sets an absolute limit on risk-assumption in the Bancorps annual and strategic plans. The Bancorp understands that not all financial resources may persist as viable loss buffers over time. Further, consideration must be given to regulatory capital buffers required per Capital Policy Targets that would reduce risk capacity. Those factors take the form of capacity adjustments to arrive at an Operating Risk Capacity which represents the operating risk level the Bancorp can assume while maintaining its solvency standard. The Bancorps policy currently discounts its Operating Risk Capacity by a minimum of 5% to provide a buffer; as a result, the Bancorps risk appetite is limited by policy to, at most, 95% of its Operating Risk Capacity.  

Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial resources required to support the Bancorps risks. The Bancorp measures economic capital under the assumption that it expects to maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. The Bancorps capital policies require that the Operating Risk Capacity less the aforementioned buffer exceed the calculated economic capital required in its business.  

Risk appetite is the aggregate amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and customers, the Bancorps risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise Risk Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative terms; however certain risk types also have quantitative metrics that are used to measure the Bancorps level of risk against its risk tolerances. The Bancorps risk appetite and risk tolerances are supported by risk targets and risk limits. Those limits are used to monitor the amount of risk assumed at a granular level. On a quarterly basis, the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board reviews current assessments of each of the eight risk types relative to the established tolerance. Information supporting these assessments, including policy limits and key risk indicators, is also reported to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board. Any results outside of tolerance require the development of an action plan that describes actions to be taken to return the measure to within the tolerance.

Risk management oversight and governance is provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and through multiple management committees whose membership includes a broad cross-section of line-of-business, regional market and support representatives. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors consists of five outside directors and has the responsibility for the oversight of risk management for the Bancorp, as well as for the Bancorps overall aggregate risk profile. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved the formation of key management governance committees that are responsible for evaluating risks and controls. The primary committee responsible for the oversight of risk management is the ERMC. Committees accountable to the ERMC, which support the core risk programs, are the Corporate Credit Committee, the Operational Risk Committee, the Management Compliance Committee, the Asset/Liability Committee and the Enterprise Marketing Committee. Other committees accountable to the ERMC 

 oversee the ALLL, capital, model risk and regulatory change management functions. There are also new products and initiatives processes applicable to every line of business to ensure an appropriate standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a new product or initiative. Significant risk policies approved by the management governance committees are also reviewed and approved by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Credit Risk Review is an independent function responsible for evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs. Credit Risk Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and administratively to the Chief Auditor. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  

The objective of the Bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices. These practices include conservative exposure and counterparty limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities 

 are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate reserve and take any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorps credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. 

The following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The risk grading system currently utilized for reserve analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio 

 monitoring and capital allocation that includes a through-the-cycle rating philosophy for modeling expected losses. The dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional six grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category risk rating system.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool. The Bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual risk rating system outputs to develop a U.S. GAAP compliant ALLL model and will make a decision on the use of modified dual risk ratings for purposes of determining the Bancorps ALLL once the FASB has issued a final standard regarding proposed methodology changes to the determination of credit impairment as outlined in the FASBs Proposed ASUFinancial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Subtopic 825-15) issued on December 20, 2012. Scoring systems, various analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the Bancorps homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.  

Overview  

Economic growth continues to improve, and GDP is expected to maintain its modest expansionary pattern. The U.S. job market is slowly but steadily improving. Housing prices have largely stabilized and are increasing in many markets. However, overall current economic and competitive conditions are causing weaker than desired qualified loan growth, that combined with a weakness in global economic conditions and a relatively low interest rate environment, may directly or indirectly impact the Bancorps growth and profitability.  

Among consumer portfolios, residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress. As of December 31, 2015, consumer real estate loans originated from 2005 through 2008 represent approximately 20% of the consumer real estate portfolio and approximately 60% of total losses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Loss rates continue to improve as newer vintages are performing within expectations. Currently, the level of new commercial real estate fundings is slightly above the amortization and payoff of the portfolio with growth in the commercial construction portfolio as those markets have rebounded. The Bancorp continues to engage in loss mitigation strategies such as reducing credit commitments, restructuring certain commercial and consumer loans, as well as utilizing commercial and consumer loan workout teams. For commercial and consumer loans owned by the Bancorp, loan modification strategies are developed that are workable for both the borrower and the Bancorp when the borrower displays a willingness to cooperate. These strategies typically involve either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loans maturity date with a stated rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loans accrued interest. For residential mortgage loans serviced for FHLMC and FNMA, the Bancorp participates in the HAMP and HARP 2.0 programs. For loans refinanced under the HARP 2.0 program, the Bancorp strictly adheres to the underwriting requirements of the program. Loan restructuring under the HAMP program is performed on behalf of FHLMC or FNMA and the Bancorp does not take possession of these loans during the modification process. Therefore, participation in these programs does not significantly impact the Bancorps credit quality statistics. The Bancorp participates in trial modifications in conjunction with the HAMP program for loans it services for FHLMC and FNMA. As these trial modifications relate to loans serviced for others, they are not included in the Bancorps TDRs as they are not assets of the Bancorp. In the event there is a representation and warranty violation on loans sold through the programs, the Bancorp may be required to repurchase the sold loans. As of December 31, 2015, repurchased loans restructured or refinanced under these programs were immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, as of December 31, 

 2015 and 2014, $14 million and $22 million, respectively, of loans refinanced under HARP 2.0 were included in loans held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bancorp recognized $6 million and $13 million, respectively, of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the sale of loans restructured or refinanced under the HAMP and HARP 2.0 programs.  

In the financial services industry, there has been heightened focus on foreclosure activity and processes. The Bancorp actively works with borrowers experiencing difficulties and has regularly modified or provided forbearance to borrowers where a workable solution could be found. Foreclosure is a last resort, and the Bancorp undertakes foreclosures only when it believes they are necessary and appropriate and is careful to ensure that customer and loan data are accurate.  

At December 31, 2015, the Bancorps non-power producing energy portfolio balance was $1.7 billion, representing approximately 2% of total loans and leases. This portfolio continues to be an important part of the Bancorps commercial business strategy. Due to the sensitivity of this portfolio to downward movements in oil prices, the Bancorp has seen migration in the portfolio into criticized classifications during 2015. When establishing the ALLL, all portfolio and general economic factors are considered, including the level of criticized assets and the level of commodity prices.  

Commercial Portfolio  

The Bancorps credit risk management strategy includes minimizing concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type.  

The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), sensitivity and pro-forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. In addition, the Bancorp applies incremental valuation adjustments to older appraisals that relate to collateral dependent loans, which can currently be up to 20-30% of the appraised value based on the type of collateral. These incremental valuation adjustments generally reflect the age of the most recent appraisal as well as collateral type. Trends in collateral values, such as home price indices and recent asset dispositions, are monitored in order to determine whether changes to the appraisal adjustments are warranted.

The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide 

 detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage loans individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

Consumer Portfolio  

The Bancorps consumer portfolio is materially comprised of three categories of loans: residential mortgage, home equity and automobile. The Bancorp has identified certain categories within these loan types which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio due to high loan amount to collateral value. The Bancorp does not update LTV ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans.  

Residential Mortgage Portfolio  

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through conservative underwriting and documentation standards and geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.  

The Bancorp does not originate mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are 

 less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed and ARM loans. Resets of rates on ARMs are not expected to have a material impact on credit costs in the current interest rate environment, as approximately $846 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of those resets, 89% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately one third of a percent.  

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTV ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in a LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTV ratios and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Home Equity Portfolio  

The Bancorps home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the Bancorps newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity.  

The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is calculated on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable credit losses in the home equity portfolio. The modeled loss factor 

 for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for credit administration and portfolio management, credit policy and underwriting and the national and local economy. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the national and local economy qualitative factor.  

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and those loans with a LTV 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. 

63 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The carrying value of the greater than 80% LTV home equity loans and 80% or less LTV home equity loans were $2.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. Of the total $8.3 billion of outstanding home equity loans:  

   ●  85% reside within the Bancorps Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as of December 31, 2015;  

   ●  35% are in senior lien positions and 65% are in junior lien positions at December 31, 2015;  

   ●  Over 80% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the year ended December 31, 2015; and  

   ●  The portfolio had an average refreshed FICO score of 742 and 740 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update 

 LTV ratios after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its on-going credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off, unless it is well-secured and in the process of collection. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for more information.

Automobile Portfolio  

The automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers. As of December 31, 2015, 50% of the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by 

 new automobiles. It is a common practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

European Exposure  

The Bancorp has no direct sovereign exposure to any European government as of December 31, 2015. In providing services to our customers, the Bancorp routinely enters into financial transactions with foreign domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign businesses as well as foreign financial institutions. These financial transactions are in the form of loans, loan commitments, letters of credit, derivatives, guarantees, bankers acceptances and securities. The 

 Bancorps risk appetite for foreign country exposure is managed by having established country exposure limits. The Bancorps total exposure to European domiciled or owned businesses and European financial institutions was $3.7 billion and funded exposure was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, the Bancorp was within its established country exposure limits for all European countries. 

The following table provides detail about the Bancorps exposure to all European domiciled and owned businesses and financial institutions as of December 31, 2015:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (b)  Peripheral Europe includes Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.  

 (c)  Eurozone includes countries participating in the European common currency (Euro).  

 (d)  Other Europe includes European countries not part of the Eurozone (primarily the United Kingdom and Switzerland).  

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets  

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 51. For further information on the Bancorps policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases refer to the Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Nonperforming assets were $659 million at December 31 2015 compared to $783 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, $12 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $39 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in nonaccrual loans held for sale from December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the sale in 2015 of $10 million of held for sale residential mortgage loans classified as TDRs. The remaining decrease was due to paydowns and additional sales of nonaccrual loans held for sale.  

Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases and OREO, as of December 31, 2015 were 0.70%, compared to 0.86% as of December 31, 2014. Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO were 0.70% as of December 31, 2015, compared to 0.82% as of December 31, 2014. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 43% of total nonaccrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2015 compared to 50% as of December 31, 2014.

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Commercial portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $341 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $26 million from December 31, 2014 as charge-offs, loan paydowns/payoffs, loan transfers to OREO and loans sold outpaced new nonaccruals.  

Consumer portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $165 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $47 million from December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to charge-offs, loan paydowns/payoffs and transfers to accrual status and OREO which outpaced new nonaccrual loans. Geographical market conditions continue to be a large driver of nonaccrual activity as Florida properties represent approximately 11% of residential mortgage balances, but represent 27% of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015. Refer to Table 52 for a rollforward of the nonaccrual loans and leases. 

OREO and other repossessed property was $141 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $165 million at December 31, 2014. The Bancorp recognized $24 million and $26 million in losses on the sale or write-down of OREO properties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a modest improvement in general economic conditions.  

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $35 million and $49 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

The following table provides a rollforward of portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases, by portfolio segment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Troubled Debt Restructurings  

If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. These modifications are classified as TDRs.  

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Commercial loans modified as part 

 of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six month payment history is sustained.  

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $979 million and $905 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past due 30 days or more were 30%, 11% and 31%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs  

Net charge-offs were 48 bps and 64 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Table 55 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category.  

The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases decreased to 46 bps during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 48 bps in the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in average commercial loan and lease balances of $2.3 billion. Commercial net charge-offs were flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  

The ratio of consumer loan and lease net charge-offs to average consumer loans and leases decreased to 51 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 86 bps for the year ended December 31, 2014. Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs, which typically involve partial charge-offs based upon appraised values of underlying collateral, decreased $109 million from 

 December 31, 2014. The decrease in net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans was primarily due to an $87 million charge-off related to the transfer of certain residential mortgage loans from portfolio to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014. The remaining decrease was due to improvements in delinquencies and loss severities. The Bancorp expects the composition of the residential mortgage portfolio to improve as it continues to retain high quality residential mortgage loans.  

Home equity net charge-offs decreased $20 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to improvements in loss severities. In addition, management actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.  

Automobile loans, credit card and other consumer loans and leases net charge-offs remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. The Bancorp utilizes a risk-adjusted pricing methodology to ensure adequate compensation is received for those products that have higher credit costs.

Allowance for Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall ALLL, including an unallocated component. These factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and 

 current national and local economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A for more information.  

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bancorp did not substantively change any material aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The ALLL attributable to the portion of the residential mortgage and consumer loan and lease portfolio that has not been restructured is determined on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics. Loss factors for real estate backed consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors. The prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. For real estate backed consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for credit administration and portfolio management practices, credit policy and underwriting practices and the national and local economy. The Bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint when determining the national and local economy qualitative factor. The Bancorp also considers the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the unallocated component of the ALLL. 

The Bancorps determination of the ALLL for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. In the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $149 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, the Bancorps determination of the ALLL for residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates would increase by 10%, the ALLL for residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases would increase by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2015. As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Certain inherent, but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other qualitative adjustments. Due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-derived estimate of ALLL tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating credit environment, and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. Given these model 

 limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results.  

An unallocated component to the ALLL is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. The unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at both December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.12%. The unallocated allowance was 9% of the total allowance as of December 31, 2015 compared to 8% as of December 31, 2014.  

As shown in Table 57, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.37% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.47% at December 31, 2014. The ALLL was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  

Market risk arises from the potential for market fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices that may result in potential reductions in net income. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income or financial position due to changes in interest rates. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk can occur for any one or more of the following reasons:  

   ●  Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times;  

   ●  Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts; or  

   ●  The expected maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.  

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through their effect on loan demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorps earnings. Stability of the Bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorps balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to reduce this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios. 

Interest Rate Risk Management Oversight  

The Bancorps ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of market risk activities.  

Net Interest Income Sensitivity  

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates. The model is based on contractual and assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorps assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.  

The Bancorps interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped increases and a 25 bps parallel rate decrease in interest rates. 

72 Fifth Third Bancorp  

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 In accordance with policy, the 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped increased rate movements are assumed to occur over one year and are sustained thereafter. The 25 bps parallel rate decrease is an immediate change. The analysis would typically include 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped decreases in interest rates; however, this analysis is currently omitted due to the current low levels of certain interest rates. Applying the ramps would result in certain interest rates becoming negative in the parallel ramped decrease scenarios.  

In this economic cycle, banks have experienced significant growth in deposit balances, particularly in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The Bancorp, like other banks, is exposed to deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment. In consideration of this risk, the Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $2.5 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances run-off for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. These lost noninterest-bearing demand 

 deposit balances are modeled to flow into funding products that reprice in conjunction with market rate increases.  

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase when market rates increase. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta and it represents the expected amount by which the Bancorp deposit rates will increase for a given increase in short-term market rates. The Bancorps NII sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 70%, which is approximately 20 percentage points higher than the 50% beta that the Bancorp experienced in the last FRB tightening cycle from June 2004 to June 2006.  

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also evaluates the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2015, the Bancorps net interest income would benefit in year one and year two under parallel ramp increases and suffer from a parallel rate curve decline. The benefit to rising rates was attributable to the combination of floating-rate assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, and certain intermediate-term fixed-rate liabilities. The rising rates benefit was down modestly compared to December 31, 2014. The decline in the NII benefit was primarily attributable to growth in the 

 investment portfolio, with a partial offset from core deposit growth. The year two benefit was also impacted by changes to wholesale funding assumptions, which include a greater reliance on floating-rate debt.  

Tables 59 and 60 provide information on the Bancorps estimated net interest income sensitivity profile given changes to balances or certain key assumptions. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated net interest income sensitivity profile with a $1 billion decrease and a $1 billion increase in demand deposit balances as of December 31, 2015:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated net interest income sensitivity profile with a 25% increase and a 25% decrease to the deposit beta assumption as of December 31, 2015. The resulting weighted-average interest-bearing deposit beta included in this analysis is approximately 88% and 52%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015:

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity  

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the net interest income sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted NII over one and two year time horizons, the EVE analysis is a point in time analysis of the current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this 

 longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of transaction deposits. 

The following table shows the Bancorps estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The EVE sensitivity to rising rates was modestly negative at December 31, 2015 and exposure to rising rates has increased from the EVE sensitivity at December 31, 2014. The higher level of EVE risk since December 31, 2014 was attributable to growth in the investment portfolio and certain fixed-rate consumer loans.  

While an instantaneous shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.  

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, LIBOR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impact on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.  

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk  

An integral component of the Bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include 

 interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities.  

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options.  

The Bancorp also establishes derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge significant exposures assumed in commercial customer accommodation derivative contracts. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. For further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk  

Although the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases expected cash flows as of December 31, 2015:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk  

The net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $784 million and $856 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.  

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused actual prepayments on the servicing portfolio to decrease. The decrease in actual prepayments on the servicing portfolio caused the modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, which led to a recovery of temporary impairment of $4 million on servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2015. Mortgage rates decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 which caused actual prepayments on the servicing portfolio to increase. The increase in actual prepayments on the servicing portfolio caused the modeled prepayment speeds to increase, which led to a temporary impairment of $65 million on servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers 

 loan rate. In addition to the MSR valuation, the Bancorp recognized net gains of $90 million and $95 million on derivatives associated with its non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on MSRs.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorps foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $812 million and $720 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Bancorp has internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash, investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that assesses the liquidity needs under various scenarios of market conditions, asset growth and credit rating downgrades. The plan includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and uses of funds under the different scenarios. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity.  

Sources of Funds  

The Bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings.  

Table 62 of the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. Of the $29.0 billion of securities in the Bancorps available-for-sale and other portfolio at December 31, 2015, $3.9 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $3.7 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorps securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorps ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgages, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bancorp sold or securitized loans totaling $6.4 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively. For further information on the transfer of financial assets, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds. The Bancorps average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded 82% of its average total assets during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Certificates $100,000 and over and deposits in the Bancorps foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.  

As of December 31, 2015, $8.9 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current Bancorps 

 Board of Directors authorizations and the Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. On July 27, 2015, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.1 billion of senior fixed-rate notes. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp has approximately $38.6 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the FHLB and FRB.  

The Bancorps banking subsidiarys global bank note program has a borrowing capacity of $25 billion. On August 20, 2015, the Bank issued and sold $1.0 billion of senior fixed-rate notes and $250 million of senior floating-rate notes. The Bank has $18.4 billion of borrowing capacity under the bank note program as of December 31, 2015.  

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bancorp transferred approximately $750 million in consumer automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a VIE. The Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE and, therefore, has consolidated this VIE. The assets of this VIE are restricted to the settlement of the notes and other obligations of the VIE. Third-party holders of the notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp.  

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio  

A key reform within the Basel III framework to strengthen international liquidity standards was the BCBS introduction of the LCR and NSFR. On January 7, 2013, the BCBS issued a final standard for the LCR applicable to large internationally active banking organizations. The BCBS issued a final NSFR standard in the fourth quarter of 2014 and disclosure requirements in the second quarter of 2015 which are applicable to internationally active banks. The NSFR will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. The Bancorp is currently evaluating the BCBS standard for NSFR and will begin to conform to a domestic version of the NSFR once adopted by the U.S. banking regulators.  

Section 165 of the DFA requires the FRB to establish enhanced liquidity standards in the U.S. for BHCs with total assets of $50 billion or greater. On October 10, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies published final rules implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the LCR standard established by the BCBS for large internationally active banking organizations, generally those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. In addition, a Modified LCR requirement was finalized for BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets that are not internationally active, such as the Bancorp. The Modified LCR requires BHCs to maintain HQLA equal to its calculated net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor of 0.7. The Modified LCR is effective January 1, 2016 and requires BHCs to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. The final rule includes a transition period for the modified LCR in which BHCs must maintain HQLA of 90% of its calculated net cash outflows for 2016 and then 100% beginning in 2017. The Bancorp estimates its Modified LCR was 116% at December 31, 2015 calculated under the Modified LCR final rule. For more information on LCR, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  

Credit Ratings  

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorps credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorps financial condition and liquidity.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.  

The Bancorps credit ratings are summarized in Table 64. The ratings reflect the ratings agencys view on the Bancorps capacity to meet financial commitments. * 

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems or due to external events that are neither market nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorps activities and can manifest itself in various ways including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, cyber-security incidents and privacy breaches, or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorps risk management goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorps risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates, and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.  

To control, monitor, and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an overall Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring, and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions, and to provide independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). In 2015, Business Controls Directors were appointed in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation 

 and execution of managing day to day operational risk (first line of defense).  

The Bancorps risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the Bancorps approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, Vendor Risk Management, and operational losses. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes support the Bancorps goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorps performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred. 

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT  

Regulatory Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Thirds activities and functions. Fifth Third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorps integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. The Bancorps risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorps risk appetite.  

The current regulatory environment, including heightened regulatory expectations and material changes in laws and regulations, increases compliance risk. To mitigate compliance risk, 

 Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency, and ensures that lines of business, regions and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. The lines of business and enterprise functions are responsible for managing the compliance risks associated with their areas. Additionally, Compliance Risk Management implements key compliance programs and processes including but not limited to, risk assessments, key risk indicators program, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, anti-money laundering, privacy, and oversees the Bancorps compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.  

Fifth Third also focuses on reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the Board. The Management Compliance Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee addresses Fifth Third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns, and other leading indicators of compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, which reports to Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  

Management regularly reviews the Bancorps capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.  

Regulatory Capital Ratios  

The Basel III Final Rule was effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of its components and other provisions. It established quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items and also defined and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Bancorp was subject to the General Risk-Based Capital Rules (Basel I). The minimum capital ratios established under the Basel III Final Rule are 4.5% for the CET1 capital ratio, 6% for the Tier I risk-based capital ratio, 8% for the Total risk-based capital ratio and 4% for the Tier I Leverage ratio (Tier I capital to average 

 consolidated assets). The PCA provisions adopted by the U.S. banking agencies define well-capitalized ratios for CET1 capital, Tier I risk-based capital, Total risk-based capital and Tier I Leverage greater than or equal to 6.5%, 8%, 10% and 5%, respectively. Additionally, the Basel III Final Rule includes a capital conservation buffer of CET1 capital of 2.5% in additional to the 4.5% minimum requirement, or 7%, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Bancorp exceeded these well-capitalized and capital conservation buffer ratios for all periods presented.  

The Bancorp made a one-time permanent election to not include AOCI in regulatory capital in the March 31, 2015 FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C filings. The Basel III Final Rule phases out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I capital. Under these provisions, these TruPS would qualify as a component of Tier II capital. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorps Tier I capital included $13 million of TruPS representing approximately 1 bp of risk-weighted assets under the transition provisions of the Basel III Final Rule. 

The following table summarizes the Bancorps capital ratios as of December 31:

Preferred Stock Offering  

As contemplated by the 2014 capital plan part of the FRBs CCAR, on June 5, 2014, the Bancorp issued in a registered public offering 300,000 depositary shares, representing 12,000 shares of 4.90% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative Series J perpetual preferred stock, for net proceeds of $297 million. Each preferred share has a $25,000 liquidation preference. The preferred stock accrues dividends, on a non-cumulative semi-annual basis, at an annual rate of 4.90% through but excluding September 30, 2019, at which time 

 it converts to a quarterly floating rate dividend of three-month LIBOR plus 3.129%. Subject to any required regulatory approval, the Bancorp may redeem the Series J preferred shares at its option in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 30, 2019, or at any time following a regulatory capital event. The Series J preferred shares are not convertible into Bancorp common shares or any other securities.

Stress Tests and CCAR  

In 2011 the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHCs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Further, each BHC must also report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. The FRB launched the 2015 stress testing program and CCAR on October 23, 2014, with firm submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the FRB due to the FRB on January 5, 2015, which the Bancorp submitted as required. Refer to Note 3 and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the FRBs review of the capital plan, the FRBs non-objection to the Bancorps proposed capital actions and the Bancorps capital actions taken in 2015.  

The FRB launched the 2016 stress testing program and CCAR on January 28, 2016. The stress testing results and capital plan are required to be submitted by the Bancorp to the FRB by April 5, 2016.  

The FRB expects to release summary results of the 2016 stress testing program and CCAR in June of 2016. The results will include 

 supervisory projections of capital ratios, losses and revenues under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios. The FRB will also issue an objection or non-objection to each participating institutions capital plan submitted under CCAR. The FRBs summary results will also include an overview of methodologies used for supervisory tests. Additionally, as a CCAR institution, the Bancorp will be required to disclose the results of its company-run stress test as required by the DFA, within 15 days of the date the FRB discloses the results of its DFA supervisory stress test.  

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program  

The Bancorps common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.52 and $0.51 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchases. 

The following table summarizes shares authorized for repurchase for the years ended December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  In March 2014, the Bancorp announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to purchase 100 million shares of the Bancorps common stock through the open market or in any private transaction. The authorization does not include specific price targets or an expiration date. This share repurchase authorization replaces the Boards previous authorization pursuant to which approximately 35 million shares remained available for repurchase by the Bancorp.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial transactions that are considered off-balance sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorps off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments, contingent liabilities, guarantees and transactions with non-consolidated VIEs. A brief discussion of these transactions is as follows:  

Commitments  

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward contracts related to held for sale residential mortgage loans, noncancelable operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, capital commitments for private equity investments and capital expenditures. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on commitments.  

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities  

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.  

Transactions with Non-consolidated VIEs  

The Bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on non-consolidated VIEs.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. The aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015 are shown in Table 67. As of December 31, 2015, the Bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate 

 in future periods. Due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the following table. For further detail on the impact of income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Includes demand, interest checking, savings, money market and foreign office deposits. For additional information, refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

 (b)  Interest-bearing obligations are principally used to fund interest-earning assets. As such, interest charges on contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts, as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest-earning assets. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these debt instruments.  

 (c)  Includes other time and certificates $100,000 and over. For additional information, refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

 (d)  Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on forward contracts to sell residential mortgage loans.  

 (e)  Includes federal funds purchased and borrowings with an original maturity of less than one year. For additional information, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (f)  Includes rental commitments.  

 (g)  Includes low-income housing and historic tax investments. For additional information, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (h)  Represents agreements to purchase goods or services and includes commitments to various general contractors for work related to banking center construction.  

 (i)  Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension obligations.  

 (j)  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment amounts include capital commitments for private equity investments and do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. For additional information, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (k)  Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. For additional information, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorps management, including the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act). Based on the foregoing, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to management on a timely basis.  

The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Bancorps management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Managements assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. The Bancorps independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Bancorps consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. This report appears on page 83 of the annual report.  

The Bancorps management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change during the year covered by this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  

Cincinnati, Ohio  

February 25, 2016  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorps management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting.
