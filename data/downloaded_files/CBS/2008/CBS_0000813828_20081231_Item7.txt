 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  

 Overview  

 For 2008, CBS Corporation reported revenues of $13.95 billion, down 1% from $14.07 billion in 2007, an operating loss of $12.16 billion and a net loss of $11.67 billion, or a loss of $17.43 per diluted share. Results for 2008 include pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $14.18 billion ($12.73 billion, net of tax), or $19.00 per diluted share, primarily to reduce the carrying value of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets. CBS Corp.'s 2008 operating results were negatively impacted by the weakened economy, mainly in the second half of the year. Many key advertisers significantly reduced their advertising spending, primarily at the local level, which contributed to a decline in advertising revenues of 8% for the year. The Company recorded restructuring charges of $136.7 million reflecting severance costs associated with the elimination of positions, contract terminations and other associated costs, which are expected to reduce its annual cost structure by approximately $220 million.  

 On June 30, 2008, the Company acquired CNET Networks, Inc. ("CNET"), a global interactive media company with entertainment, news and information Internet sites and brands including CNET, ZDNet, GameSpot, TV.com, mp3.com, CNETnews.com, UrbanBaby, CHOW, Search.com, BNET, MySimon and TechRepublic. The CNET acquisition expanded the Company's Internet presence worldwide. The Company's existing Internet brands, combined with those of CNET, reached approximately 226 million unique monthly visitors worldwide during December 2008.  

 Description of Business  

 CBS Corp. is comprised of the following segments: Television, Radio, Outdoor, Interactive and Publishing. Effective July 1, 2008, the Company combined its existing interactive businesses, which were previously reported in the Television segment, with those of CNET and realigned its management structure to create an Interactive segment. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  

CBS Corp. operates in the following segments:    

TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of CBS Television, comprised of the CBS Television Network, the Company's owned television stations, its television production and syndication operations, and CBS College Sports Network; and Showtime Networks. Television revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, television license fees and affiliate revenues. Television contributed 64% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 65% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.   

RADIO: The Radio segment owns radio stations in most of the large U.S. markets. Radio revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. Radio contributed 11%, 12% and 14% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Advertising sales decreased 8% to $9.24 billion in 2008 from $10.06 billion in 2007 reflecting weakness in the television and radio advertising markets, the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network, lower primetime ratings for the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partly as a result of the Writers Guild of America ("WGA") strike, which was settled in February 2008, and the impact of television and radio station divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of CNET and higher political advertising sales due to the 2008 presidential election. The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from advertising sales, which are directly affected by the health of the economy. To the extent that the economic downturn continues, the Company will likely continue to experience softness in its advertising businesses during 2009. In 2007, advertising sales decreased 3% to $10.06 billion from $10.37 billion in 2006 reflecting the absence of UPN and the impact of radio and television station divestitures, which together reduced the Company's advertising sales by 3% for 2007 versus 2006. The decline in advertising sales also reflected lower political advertising sales and weakness in the radio advertising market. These declines were partially offset by the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network and growth in advertising sales at Outdoor.  

 Television license fees increased 40% to $1.94 billion in 2008 from $1.38 billion in 2007 principally reflecting higher domestic and international syndication sales of the  CSI series, including the impact of the new international self-distribution arrangement for the  CSI franchise, which was previously distributed by a third party. Television license fees decreased 14% to $1.38 billion in 2007 from $1.61 billion in 2006 principally reflecting lower domestic syndication revenues as revenues from 2007 domestic availabilities, including NCIS, did not match contributions from the 2006 basic cable availability and off-network syndication of Frasier and the 2006 basic cable availability of Star Trek: Voyager.  

 Affiliate revenues increased 6% to $1.19 billion in 2008 from $1.12 billion in 2007 principally due to rate increases and subscriber growth at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network. Affiliate revenues increased 4% to $1.12 billion in 2007 from $1.07 billion in 2006 driven by rate increases and subscriber growth at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network.  

 Publishing revenues decreased 3% to $857.7 million in 2008 from $886.1 million in 2007 principally reflecting lower book sales due to a difficult comparison with the prior year, which included the success of the best-selling title The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. Publishing revenues increased 10% to $886.1 million in 2007 from $807.0 million in 2006 reflecting higher sales in the Adult and International groups, led by the release of The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.  

 Home entertainment revenues, primarily consisting of DVD sales, increased 16% to $234.0 million in 2008 from $201.9 million in 2007 reflecting the mix of available DVD releases. Home entertainment revenues increased $118.5 million to $201.9 million in 2007 from $83.4 million in 2006, as the Company was in the second year of a third party distribution arrangement which provides the Company with revenues after recoupment of upfront distribution costs incurred by the third party distributor.  

 Other revenues, which include digital media revenues and other ancillary fees for Television, Radio, Outdoor and Interactive operations, increased 17% to $494.3 million in 2008 from $424.1 million in 2007, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of CNET. For 2007, other revenues increased 12% to $424.1 million in 2007 from $380.3 million in 2006 principally reflecting higher digital media revenues.

 International Revenues  

 The Company generated approximately 16% of its total revenues from international regions in 2008, 12% in 2007 and 11% in 2006. The increase in international revenues for 2008 primarily reflects the impact of the new international self-distribution arrangement for the CSI franchise.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Operating Expenses  

 The table below presents the Company's consolidated operating expenses by type.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 For 2008, operating expenses of $8.65 billion increased 4% from $8.33 billion in 2007. For 2007, operating expenses of $8.33 billion decreased 1% from $8.42 billion in 2006. The major components and changes in operating expenses were as follows:    

Programming expenses represented 38% of total operating expenses in 2008, 41% in 2007 and 40% in 2006, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses decreased 3% to $3.29 billion in 2008 from $3.39 billion in 2007 principally reflecting lower sports programming costs from the absence of the telecast of Super Bowl XLI which aired on CBS Television Network during the first quarter of 2007 and lower costs in 2008 due to the impact of the WGA strike, partially offset by higher cable programming costs. Programming expenses increased 1% to $3.39 billion in 2007 from $3.35 billion in 2006 reflecting higher costs associated with the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the absence of UPN, which was shut down in September 2006.   

Production expenses represented 30% of total operating expenses in 2008, 28% in 2007 and 31% in 2006, and reflect the costs and amortization of internally developed television programs, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, and production overhead, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses increased 10% to $2.57 billion in 2008 from $2.33 billion in 2007 primarily reflecting higher costs associated with higher syndication sales, principally for the CSI series, partially offset by lower costs   

II-7 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)    

due to the impact of the WGA strike, which resulted in fewer episodes and pilots produced in 2008, and the cancellation of certain television series. Production expenses decreased 10% to $2.33 billion in 2007 from $2.59 billion in 2006 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with lower syndication revenues.    

Outdoor operations expenses represented 15% of total operating expenses in 2008, and 14% in both 2007 and 2006, and reflect transit, billboard lease, maintenance, posting and rotation expenses. Outdoor operations expenses increased 8% to $1.27 billion in 2008 from $1.18 billion in 2007 primarily due to contractual increases in billboard lease and transit costs and the impact of acquisitions. Outdoor operations expenses increased 1% to $1.18 billion in 2007 from $1.17 billion in 2006 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes and increased costs for maintenance and materials, partially offset by lower transit costs, principally reflecting the non-renewal of certain transit and street furniture contracts in New York City and Chicago.   

Publishing operations expenses, which represented 7% of total operating expenses in 2008 and 2007 and 6% in 2006, reflect the cost of book sales, royalties and other costs incurred with respect to publishing operations. Publishing operations expenses decreased 4% to $566.5 million in 2008 from $590.1 million in 2007 reflecting lower royalty and production expenses driven by the decrease in revenues, which was largely due to lower sales of the best-selling title  The Secret. Publishing operations expenses increased 9% to $590.1 million in 2007 from $539.2 million in 2006 reflecting increased production costs and higher royalty expenses resulting from the increase in revenues and the mix of titles.   

Other operating expenses, which represented 11% of total operating expenses in 2008, 10% in 2007 and 9% in 2006, primarily include distribution expenses incurred with respect to television product, costs associated with digital media, and compensation. Other operating expenses increased 14% to $948.4 million in 2008 from $835.0 million in 2007 due to increased costs associated with digital media, including the impact of the acquisition of CNET, and higher television distribution costs. Other operating expenses increased 7% to $835.0 million in 2007 from $777.5 million in 2006 due to higher television distribution costs and higher costs associated with digital media.   

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2008, 2007 and 2006. SG&A expenses decreased $57.4 million, or 2%, to $2.61 billion in 2008 from $2.67 billion in 2007, primarily reflecting lower costs resulting from cost-saving initiatives, the settlement of an international receivable claim, lower postretirement benefits expenses, and lower expenses due to the divestitures of television and radio stations, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and higher stock-based compensation expense. In 2008, pension and postretirement benefits expenses decreased $15.2 million from 2007 due to higher actuarial gains related to postretirement plans. Pension expense is expected to increase in 2009 primarily due to plan asset performance in 2008.  

 For 2007, SG&A expenses decreased $106.6 million, or 4%, to $2.67 billion in 2007 from $2.77 billion in 2006, primarily reflecting lower expenses due to the divestitures of radio and television stations, the absence of UPN and lower pension and postretirement benefits expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense and increased costs associated with online and interactive businesses. In 2007, pension and postretirement benefits expenses decreased $66.7 million from 2006 primarily due to the recognition of lower actuarial losses and the impact of $250.0 million of discretionary contributions made during 2006 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans.

 Restructuring Charges  

 During 2008, as a result of weakened economic conditions, the Company reduced its cost structure across all of its segments. Accordingly, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $136.7 million, which are expected to reduce the Company's annual cost structure by approximately $220 million. The charges reflect $127.5 million of severance costs and $9.2 million of contract termination and other associated costs. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company paid $44.5 million of the severance costs and $1.5 million of the contract termination and other associated costs. The following table sets forth the 2008 activity for these restructuring charges by segment.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 During September 2006, the Company combined the resources of its syndication and distribution operations. As a result, restructuring charges of $11.6 million were recorded in the Television segment during the year ended December 31, 2006. The charges reflected severance costs of $9.7 million and legal, lease termination and other expenses of $1.9 million. As of December 31, 2008 the Company had settled substantially all of these liabilities.  

 Impairment Charges  

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") requires the Company to perform a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives annually and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its book value. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test as a result of its assessment of factors including the continuation of adverse market conditions, which affected the Company's market value and trading multiples for entities within the Company's industry, as well as the continued economic slowdown which adversely affected the Company's advertising revenues, primarily at the Company's local businesses. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examined whether the book value of each of the Company's reporting units, which are generally one level below the operating segment level, exceeded its fair value. If the book value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the test required the Company to then compare the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill with the book value of its goodwill.  

 The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was computed principally based upon the present value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow Method) and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses (Market Comparable Method). The Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. For the impairment test of intangible assets with indefinite lives, the fair value of the intangible asset was compared with its book value. The estimated fair value of intangible assets was computed using the Discounted Cash Flow Method.  

II-9 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 As a result of this interim impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14.12 billion during the third quarter of 2008 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill by $10.99 billion and intangible assets by $3.13 billion. The charge was reflected as a reduction to goodwill at the Television segment of $5.81 billion, the Radio segment of $2.33 billion and the Outdoor segment of $2.85 billion as well as a reduction to the carrying value of intangible assets related to FCC licenses at the Television segment of $2.13 billion and the Radio segment of $984.6 million, and franchise agreements at the Outdoor segment of $8.2 million.  

 Also in 2008, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets by $30.4 million and the allocated goodwill by $31.6 million. In 2006, in connection with the sale of seven of its owned television stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $65.2 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)  

 The Company also performed its annual SFAS 142 impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2008. The assumptions underlying the Company's Discounted Cash Flow model for all of its reporting units were revised to reflect further slowdown of worldwide economic conditions. The Company also evaluated the reasonableness of its estimated fair values of the individual reporting units as compared to the Company's overall market capitalization during the fourth quarter. The Company's market capitalization during that period was below the aggregate fair value of its reporting units. The Company believes the substantial decrease in its traded market value during the fourth quarter of 2008 was largely due to factors which did not impact the fair value of its reporting units to the same extent. These factors included liquidity and credit concerns in the overall market and the market's perceived risk in advertising-based businesses during an economic slowdown. The Company believes the aggregate fair value of its reporting units computed based on the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method represents the best estimate of its future performance and therefore, is a more accurate fair value of the Company.  

 The fourth quarter 2008 annual SFAS 142 impairment test did not result in any additional 2008 impairment charges. However, due to the uncertainty of future economic conditions and their impact on the Company's financial performance, further downward revisions to the estimated fair values of certain reporting units or intangible assets could result in a future impairment charge.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 For 2008, depreciation and amortization increased $75.9 million, or 17%, to $531.6 million from $455.7 million principally reflecting depreciation and amortization associated with fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in connection with CNET, higher depreciation resulting from higher capital expenditures at Outdoor and higher amortization associated with other interactive businesses. For 2007, depreciation and amortization increased $16.2 million, or 4%, to $455.7 million from $439.5 million principally reflecting higher depreciation associated with new broadcast facilities.  

 Interest Expense  

 For 2008, interest expense decreased $24.3 million to $546.6 million from $570.9 million principally due to lower interest rates. For 2007, interest expense increased $5.4 million to $570.9 million from $565.5 million. The Company had $7.00 billion at December 31, 2008 and $7.09 billion at December 31, 2007 of principal amounts of debt outstanding (including current maturities), both at a weighted average interest rate of 7.1%.  

II-10

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Interest Income  

 For 2008, interest income decreased $73.9 million to $42.2 million from $116.1 million in 2007 reflecting lower average cash balances and lower interest rates. For 2007, interest income increased $4.0 million to $116.1 million from $112.1 million in 2006.  

 Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

 For 2008, the gain on early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million reflected the pre-tax gain recognized upon the repurchase of $191.8 million of the Company's 7.70% senior notes due 2010.  

 For 2006, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.0 million reflected losses recognized upon the repurchase of $50.0 million of the Company's 6.625% senior notes due 2011 and $52.2 million of the Company's 7.70% senior notes due 2010.  

 Other Items, Net  

 For 2008, "Other items, net" of $79.6 million principally reflected a gain of $129.8 million on the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel, foreign exchange gains of $32.3 million and a gain of $3.7 million relating to radio station divestitures, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $71.1 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments and $15.4 million of losses associated with securitizing accounts receivable.  

 For 2007, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $34.0 million principally consisting of losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $32.0 million and a non-cash charge of $24.8 million associated with an other-than-temporary decline in the market value of one of the Company's investments, partially offset by a net gain of $10.0 million on television and radio station divestitures, foreign exchange gains of $8.0 million and gains of $3.9 million on the sale of investments.  

 For 2006, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $14.3 million principally consisting of losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $31.0 million, a non-cash charge of $6.2 million associated with an other-than-temporary decline in the market value of one of the Company's investments and foreign exchange losses of $2.0 million, partially offset by a gain of $24.6 million on radio station divestitures.  

 Benefit (provision) for Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. The Company reported an income tax benefit of $919.3 million in 2008 versus an income tax provision of $821.5 million in 2007 and $652.2 million in 2006. The Company's annual effective income tax rate was 7.3% in 2008, 38.5% in 2007 and 30.6% in 2006. Included in the rate for 2008 was a tax benefit of $1.45 billion associated with the non-cash impairment charges of $14.18 billion primarily to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. The provision for income taxes included tax provisions of $54.7 million in 2008, $68.5 million in 2007 and $33.5 million in 2006, relating to gains on divestitures and tax benefits of $44.9 million in 2008, $8.0 million in 2007 and $164.1 million in 2006, from tax audit settlements.  

 For 2009, the Company's annual effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 36%, excluding the impact of any settlements of income tax audits or dispositions.

 Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  

 Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $17.6 million for 2008, $80.7 million for 2007 and $97.6 million for 2006. The net losses in 2007 and 2006 principally reflected non-cash charges of $62.9 million and $94.2 million, respectively, associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's equity investments. The net losses in 2008, 2007 and 2006 also reflected operating losses from the Company's 50% investment in The CW, a television broadcast network.  

 Net Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations  

 For 2008, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $11.67 billion versus net earnings from continuing operations of $1.23 billion in 2007 and $1.38 billion in 2006. The net loss in 2008 included the pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $14.18 billion ($12.73 billion, net of tax) primarily to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.  

 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations  

 During 2006, Paramount Parks was sold to Cedar Fair, L.P. for $1.24 billion and as a result, Paramount Parks has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2007, net earnings from discontinued operations of $16.2 million principally reflected adjustments to the gain on the sale of Paramount Parks. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net earnings from discontinued operations of $277.6 million primarily reflected the operating results and the gain on the sale of Paramount Parks.  

 The following table sets forth the details of CBS Corp.'s net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

 Segment Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006  

 The following tables present the Company's revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and SFAS 142 impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges"), operating income (loss), and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)The Company presents Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131"). The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges to the Company's consolidated Net earnings (loss) is presented in Note 16 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements. 

(b)During 2008, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $14.18 billion principally to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. The charges are comprised of $7.95 billion for Television, $3.38 billion for Radio and $2.86 billion for Outdoor. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.) During 2006, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $65.2 million in the Television segment to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill for certain television stations to be disposed.

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Television revenues decreased 1% to $8.99 billion from $9.11 billion in 2007 primarily due to lower advertising sales partially offset by higher television license fees and affiliate revenues. Advertising sales decreased 13% primarily reflecting softness in the advertising marketplace, the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network and lower primetime ratings during the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partly as a result of the WGA strike, which was settled in February 2008, partially offset by higher political advertising sales. Television license fees increased 41% principally reflecting higher domestic and international syndication sales of the  CSI series, including the impact of the new international self-distribution arrangement for the  CSI franchise, which was previously distributed by a third party. Affiliate revenues increased 6% primarily due to subscriber growth and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network.  

 For 2008, Television reported an operating loss of $6.43 billion, which included non-cash impairment charges of $7.95 billion principally to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, compared with operating income of $1.76 billion for 2007. Television OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 12% to $1.70 billion in 2008 from $1.94 billion in 2007 primarily due to lower advertising sales and restructuring charges of $60.5 million incurred in 2008 principally reflecting severance costs associated with the elimination of positions and contract termination costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher profits from syndication sales, principally from the  CSI series, higher affiliate revenues, lower sports programming costs associated with the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI and lower television series costs reflecting the impact of the WGA strike. Television results included stock-based compensation expense of $63.3 million for 2008 and $47.7 million for 2007.

 License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on cable are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $600.1 million and $582.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Television revenues decreased 3% to $9.11 billion from $9.35 billion in 2006 primarily due to lower television license fee and advertising revenues partially offset by increases in affiliate and home entertainment revenues. Revenue comparisons for 2007 were negatively impacted by the absence of UPN which ceased broadcasting in September 2006 and television station divestitures. These two items negatively impacted the total 2007 Television revenue comparison by 3% and 2007 Television advertising revenue comparison by 4% versus 2006. Advertising revenues decreased by 3% primarily due to the above mentioned factors and lower political advertising sales partially offset by the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network. Television license fee revenues decreased 14% reflecting lower domestic syndication revenues as revenues from 2007 domestic availabilities, including NCIS, did not match contributions from the 2006 basic cable availability and off-network syndication of Frasier and cable availability of Star Trek: Voyager. Affiliate revenues increased 4% primarily due to subscriber growth and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network. Home entertainment revenues increased $118.5 million over 2006 as the Company was in the second year of a third party distribution arrangement which provides the Company with revenues after recoupment of upfront distribution costs incurred by the third party distributor.  

 For 2007, Television operating income increased 3% to $1.76 billion from $1.70 billion in 2006. Included in 2006 operating income was a non-cash impairment charge of $65.2 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill in connection with the sale of seven television stations. Television OIBDA before impairment charges increased slightly to $1.94 billion in 2007 from $1.93 billion in 2006 principally reflecting higher home entertainment revenues and the absence of $24.0 million of shutdown costs for UPN incurred in 2006 partially offset by lower political advertising sales and lower profits from syndication sales. Television results included stock-based compensation expense of $47.7 million for 2007 and $30.5 million for 2006.  

 Dispositions  

 On January 10, 2008, the Company completed the sale of seven of its owned television stations in Austin, Salt Lake City, Providence and West Palm Beach to Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. for $185.0 million. In connection with the agreement to sell these stations, a pre-tax impairment charge of $65.2 million was recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.  

 On April 16, 2007, the Company completed an exchange agreement with Liberty Media Corporation under which the stock of a subsidiary of the Company which held CBS Corp.'s Green Bay television station and its satellite television station, valued at $64.0 million, and $169.8 million in cash was exchanged for the 7.6 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock held by Liberty Media Corporation.

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Radio revenues decreased 12% to $1.54 billion from $1.75 billion for 2007 due to lower advertising sales, reflecting weakness in the advertising market, and the impact of radio station divestitures. The station divestitures negatively impacted the Radio revenue comparison by 1% in 2008.  

 For 2008, Radio reported an operating loss of $2.91 billion, which included non-cash impairment charges of $3.38 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, compared with operating income of $657.8 million for 2007. Radio OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 27% to $499.4 million for 2008 from $688.7 million for 2007 due to lower advertising sales, restructuring charges of $53.9 million incurred during 2008 and the impact of station divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by lower talent and employee-related expenses and decreased marketing and promotion costs resulting from restructuring and cost-saving initiatives implemented during 2008, as well as lower sports programming costs. The restructuring charges in 2008 principally reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions and other associated costs. Radio results included stock-based compensation expense of $15.5 million for 2008 versus $15.9 million for 2007.  

 2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Radio revenues decreased 11% to $1.75 billion from $1.96 billion in 2006 reflecting weakness in advertising sales and the impact of radio station divestitures. The station divestitures negatively impacted the Radio revenue comparison by 5% in 2007.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 For 2007, Radio operating income decreased 16% to $657.8 million from $787.4 million in 2006 and OIBDA decreased 16% to $688.7 million from $820.0 million in 2006. These decreases principally reflected lower advertising sales, the impact of station divestitures and higher stock-based compensation expense partially offset by lower sports programming costs. Radio results included stock-based compensation expense of $15.9 million for 2007 and $10.7 million for 2006.  

 Dispositions  

 On December 22, 2008, the Company signed an agreement with Wilks Broadcasting to sell three of its radio stations in Denver for $19.5 million. In addition, on December 15, 2008, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. to swap five of the Company's mid-size market radio stations in Baltimore, Portland, Sacramento and Seattle, for two radio stations in Houston, a top 10 radio market. These transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. During 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill in connection with these sales.  

 During 2007, the Company completed the sales of 34 radio stations in nine of its smaller markets for $543.4 million. During 2006, the Company completed the sale of five radio stations in one small market for $125.0 million.  

 Outdoor (CBS Outdoor)

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% to $2.17 billion from $2.19 billion for 2007, reflecting a decline in North America (which is comprised of the United States, Canada and Mexico) partially offset by growth in International (which is comprised of Europe, Asia and South America). Revenues for North America decreased 4% from 2007 primarily due to lower revenues in the U.S. billboards businesses and the impact of the non-renewal of contracts partially offset by the inclusion of the results of CBS Outernet since its acquisition in October 2007. The non-renewal of two major municipal contracts in Toronto and San Francisco negatively impacted the revenue comparison in North America by 1% for the year. Revenues for International increased 4% from 2007 principally due to the acquisition of International Outdoor Advertising Group ("IOA") and revenue growth in the China and France markets. The

acquisition of IOA favorably impacted the International revenue comparison by 3% for the year. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $3 million for 2008. Approximately 50% and 48% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the United States for 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 For 2008, Outdoor reported an operating loss of $2.63 billion, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $2.86 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, compared with operating income of $404.9 million for 2007. Outdoor OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 25% to $467.4 million for 2008 from $620.9 million for 2007. North America reported an operating loss of $2.09 billion for 2008 versus operating income of $336.5 million for 2007, primarily reflecting a non-cash impairment charge of $2.30 billion. North America OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 22% to $403.7 million due to lower revenues, higher transit and billboard lease costs, the impact of the non-renewal of contracts and restructuring charges of $5.4 million incurred during 2008. International reported an operating loss of $544.6 million for 2008 versus operating income of $68.4 million for 2007, primarily reflecting a non-cash impairment charge of $550.9 million. International OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 38% to $63.7 million principally due to higher transit costs and restructuring charges of $7.8 million incurred during 2008. The restructuring charges at Outdoor for 2008 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in the United States, Europe and Mexico. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $7.3 million for 2008 versus $5.3 million for 2007.  

 2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Outdoor revenues increased 4% to $2.19 billion from $2.10 billion in 2006 reflecting an increase of 13% in International, driven by favorable foreign exchange rate changes and growth in the United Kingdom and France markets. Revenues for North America decreased 1% in 2007 as growth of 9% in U.S. billboards, 9% in Canada and 8% in Mexico was more than offset by a decline of 28% in U.S. transit and displays, reflecting the non-renewal of marginally profitable transit and street furniture contracts in New York City and Chicago. The non-renewal of these contracts negatively impacted the Outdoor revenue comparison by 6% in 2007. The favorable net impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $75 million in 2007. Approximately 48% and 44% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the United States in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 For 2007, Outdoor operating income increased 15% to $404.9 million from $351.8 million in 2006 and OIBDA increased 9% to $620.9 million from $568.0 million in 2006, led by growth in North America. North America operating income and OIBDA increased 23% to $336.5 million and 13% to $518.4 million, respectively, as the revenue decline was more than offset by lower transit costs due to the non-renewal of marginally profitable contracts. International operating income and OIBDA decreased 13% to $68.4 million and 5% to $102.5 million, respectively, reflecting higher transit costs, principally in the United Kingdom, and increased costs for maintenance and materials, partially offset by the revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $5.3 million for 2007 and $3.2 million for 2006.  

 Capital expenditures increased $70.7 million to $186.4 million in 2007 principally reflecting increased spending for transit contracts in the United Kingdom.

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Interactive revenues increased to $421.7 million from $166.1 million for 2007, reflecting the impact of the acquisition of CNET on June 30, 2008, higher advertising sales from the CBS Audience Network, an online network of professional video content, and higher mobile revenues.  

 For 2008, Interactive reported an operating loss of $9.3 million versus an operating loss of $21.7 million for 2007. Interactive OIBDA increased to $39.7 million for 2008 from a loss of $10.3 million for 2007. These increases were principally due to the impact of the acquisition of CNET partially offset by restructuring charges of $3.4 million incurred during 2008. The restructuring charges in 2008 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of duplicate positions as a result of the integration of CNET with the Company's existing interactive businesses. The operating loss for 2008 reflected depreciation and amortization expense associated with fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in connection with CNET. Interactive results included stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million for 2008 and $1.9 million for 2007.  

 2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Interactive revenues increased 26% to $166.1 million from $132.2 million for 2006 due to higher advertising and mobile revenues resulting from the development and expansion of interactive businesses as well as the impact of acquisitions.  

 For 2007, Interactive reported an operating loss of $21.7 million versus operating income of $9.0 million for 2006. Interactive OIBDA decreased to a loss of $10.3 million for 2007 from income of $15.1 million for 2006. These decreases were principally due to increased costs associated with business

development and acquisitions, and higher employee-related expenses. The operating loss for 2007 also reflected higher amortization expense associated with acquisitions. Interactive results included stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million for 2007 and $.6 million for 2006.  

 Acquisitions  

 On June 30, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of CNET common stock for $11.50 per share, for a total of $1.8 billion.  

 On May 30, 2007, the Company acquired Last.fm, a global, community-based, music discovery website, for approximately $280 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Publishing revenues decreased 3% to $857.7 million from $886.1 million for 2007, principally reflecting lower book sales due to difficult comparisons with the prior year, which included the release of the best-seller The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. Best-selling titles in 2008 included YOU: Being Beautiful by Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz, The Purpose of Christmas by Rick Warren, Duma Key by Stephen King and The War Within by Bob Woodward.  

 For 2008, Publishing operating income decreased 11% to $78.7 million from $88.1 million in 2007 and OIBDA decreased 9% to $88.2 million from $97.2 million in 2007. These decreases reflected the revenue decline, restructuring charges of $4.2 million incurred during 2008 and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower author royalty expenses and production costs, resulting from the revenue decline and the mix of titles, and a decline in employee-related expenses. The restructuring charges in 2008 principally consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million for 2008 and $3.5 million for 2007.  

 2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Publishing revenues increased 10% to $886.1 million from $807.0 million in 2006 primarily reflecting higher sales in the Adult and International groups, led by the performance of The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.

These increases reflected the revenue growth and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by higher production costs and author royalty expenses, resulting from the revenue increase and the mix of titles, increased employee-related costs, higher digital archive costs, and higher volume-driven advertising and selling expenses. Publishing results included stock-based compensation of $3.5 million for 2007 and $1.9 million for 2006.  

 Financial Position  

 Current assets decreased by $838.1 million to $5.19 billion at December 31, 2008 from $6.03 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $927.4 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents principally reflected cash used for acquisitions, dividends and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash flows generated from operations and the sale of investments. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 5.0% at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.  

 Net property and equipment increased by $86.8 million to $3.01 billion at December 31, 2008 from $2.92 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting capital expenditures of $474.1 million, partially offset by depreciation expense of $413.0 million. Goodwill of $8.65 billion at December 31, 2008 decreased $9.80 billion from $18.45 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the impairment of goodwill at the Television, Radio and Outdoor segments, partially offset by acquisitions. Intangible assets, principally consisting of FCC licenses, leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, decreased by $2.98 billion to $7.10 billion at December 31, 2008 from $10.08 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily due to the impairment of FCC licenses at the Television and Radio segments, television station divestitures of $98.9 million and amortization expense of $118.6 million, partially offset by acquisitions of $399.9 million.  

 Current liabilities increased $396.3 million to $4.80 billion at December 31, 2008 from $4.40 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased participants' share payable due to the impact of the new international self-distribution arrangement for the CSI franchise.  

 Pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $577.8 million to $2.27 billion at December 31, 2008 from $1.70 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting a decrease in pension plan assets due to asset performance.  

 Deferred income tax liabilities decreased $1.60 billion to $345.1 million at December 31, 2008 from $1.95 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the impact of the impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses.

 Cash Flows  

 Cash and cash equivalents decreased $927.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows:    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Operating Activities. In 2008, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $33.9 million, or 2%, to $2.15 billion from $2.18 billion in 2007 principally reflecting lower operating income, partially offset by higher cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and lower cash taxes paid. In 2007, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $177.9 million, or 9%, to $2.18 billion from $2.00 billion in 2006 principally reflecting lower cash taxes paid, lower net cash interest and $100.0 million lower discretionary contributions to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans versus 2006. The Company made discretionary contributions to pre-fund its qualified pension plans for $120.0 million in 2008, $150.0 million in 2007 and $250.0 million in 2006.  

 For 2009, the Company expects to increase its cash spending for programming, including higher investment in entertainment programming, contractual increases in sports programming and investment in the new CBS Films unit.  

 Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations was $240.3 million for 2008, $524.9 million for 2007 and $562.2 million for 2006. The decrease in cash taxes for 2008 reflects lower operating income and a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at a lower rate. Cash taxes for 2009 are expected to be approximately $175 million to $225 million, excluding the impact of gains or losses on dispositions.  

 Investing Activities. In 2008, cash used for investing activities of $2.15 billion principally reflected acquisitions of $2.04 billion, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of CNET, IOA and other outdoor advertising properties, capital expenditures of $474.1 million, and investments in investee companies of $40.2 million. These increases were partially offset by proceeds of $170.0 million from the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel and dispositions of $198.2 million, primarily from the television station divestitures. In 2007, cash used for investing activities of $135.1 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $469.1 million, acquisitions of $410.0 million, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of Last.fm, CBS Outernet and other outdoor advertising properties, and investments in investee companies of $42.3 million, principally reflecting the investment in several interactive companies and The CW. These increases were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $562.2 million,

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

primarily from the radio station divestitures, and net receipts of $172.5 million from Viacom Inc. related to the Separation. In 2006, cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of $849.5 million reflected proceeds from the sale of Paramount Parks of $1.24 billion and proceeds from other dispositions of $142.5 million, principally reflecting the sale of five radio stations. These proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of $394.1 million, investments in investee companies of $110.0 million, principally consisting of the Company's investment in The CW, and acquisitions of $97.9 million primarily consisting of the acquisition of CBS College Sports Network and outdoor advertising properties.  

 Capital expenditures increased $5.0 million, or 1%, to $474.1 million in 2008 from $469.1 million in 2007. Capital expenditures increased $75.0 million, or 19%, to $469.1 million in 2007 from $394.1 million in 2006 principally reflecting increased spending for outdoor transit contracts in the United Kingdom. For 2009, capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $350 million.  

 Financing Activities. In 2008, cash flow used for financing activities of $919.8 million principally reflected dividend payments of $705.4 million and the repayment of notes of $183.2 million. In 2007, cash flow used for financing activities of $3.78 billion principally reflected the purchase of Company common stock for $3.35 billion, the repayment of notes of $660.0 million and dividend payments of $640.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $678.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $201.7 million. In 2006, cash flow used for financing activities of $1.28 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes of $832.0 million and dividend payments of $519.1 million, partially offset by proceeds of $91.1 million from the exercise of stock options.  

 Dividends  

 On February 18, 2009, the Company announced a reduction in the quarterly cash dividend from $.27 to $.05 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2009. The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, resulting in total dividends of $725.9 million, $667.1 million and $573.2 million, respectively. Dividends have been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as the Company has an accumulated deficit balance.  

 Purchase of Company Stock  

 In January 2008, the Company received 6.0 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock upon settlement of a 2007 accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") transaction.  

 During 2007, the Company repurchased 106.9 million shares of CBS Corp. Common Stock for $3.42 billion, including $64.0 million of non-cash purchases related to a television station exchange (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), primarily through two ASR transactions.  

 Acquisitions and Dispositions  

 Acquisitions  

 On June 30, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of CNET common stock for $11.50 per share, for a total of $1.8 billion. The results of CNET have been included in the Interactive segment since its acquisition. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired of $1.29 billion was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill from the CNET acquisition primarily represents the Company's expectation of future growth for its interactive businesses. By combining CNET with its existing Internet brands and leveraging CBS Corp.'s

existing relationships, the Company is better positioned to be competitive in the interactive marketplace. The Company intends to grow its interactive businesses by, among other factors, introducing its existing advertising relationships to the CNET businesses; bringing its entertainment, sports and news content to the Internet utilizing CNET's significant Internet presence; and eliminating duplicate efforts thereby realizing meaningful cost savings.  

 On April 23, 2008, the Company acquired IOA, the leading out-of-home advertising company in South America, for $110.8 million. IOA has been included as part of the Outdoor segment since the date of acquisition.

 On December 22, 2008, the Company signed an agreement with Wilks Broadcasting to sell three of its radio stations in Denver for $19.5 million. In addition, on December 15, 2008, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. to swap five of the Company's mid-size market radio stations in Baltimore, Portland, Sacramento and Seattle, for two radio stations in Houston, a top 10 radio market. These transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. During 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill in connection with these sales.  

 During June 2008, the Company sold its 37% investment in Sundance Channel for $170.0 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $129.8 million included in "Other Items, net" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.  

 On January 10, 2008, the Company completed the sale of seven of its owned television stations in Austin, Salt Lake City, Providence and West Palm Beach to Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. for $185.0 million. In connection with the agreement to sell these stations, a pre-tax impairment charge of $65.2 million was recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.  

 On April 16, 2007, the Company completed an exchange agreement with Liberty Media Corporation under which the stock of a subsidiary of the Company which held CBS Corp.'s Green Bay television station and its satellite television station, valued at $64.0 million, and $169.8 million in cash was exchanged for the 7.6 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock held by Liberty Media Corporation.

 During 2007, the Company completed the sales of 34 radio stations in nine of its smaller markets for $543.4 million. During 2006, the Company completed the sale of five radio stations in one small market for $125.0 million.  

 On June 30, 2006, the Company completed the sale of Paramount Parks to Cedar Fair, L.P. for $1.24 billion.  

 Capital Structure    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a) At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $23.3 million and $26.2 million, respectively, and (ii) the net change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value hedges of $88.0 million and $(5.0) million, respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $6.92 billion at December 31, 2008 and $7.11 billion at December 31, 2007. 

(b) Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2008, the Company repurchased $9.5 million of its 5.625% senior notes due 2012.   

 Total debt of $7.03 billion at December 31, 2008 and $7.13 billion at December 31, 2007 was 45% and 25%, respectively, as a percentage of the total capitalization of the Company.  

 The senior debt of CBS Corp. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52.2 million of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., is not guaranteed.  

 In December 2008, prior to maturity, the Company settled all of its $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $88.4 million in cash. The increase in the carrying value of the debt attributable to the risk hedged by these interest rate swaps is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the debt.  

 For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the following debt issuances, repurchases and maturities occurred:  

 Debt Issuances   

March 27, 2007, $700.0 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2056   

 Debt Repurchases  

 During 2008, the Company repurchased $191.8 million of its 7.70% senior notes due 2010, resulting in a pre-tax gain on early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million.

 Debt Maturities   

May 1, 2007, $700.0 million, 5.625% senior notes   

 At December 31, 2008, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, including discontinued operations debt and excluding capital leases were as follows:    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Credit Facility  

 At December 31, 2008, the Company had a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires December 2010 (the "Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.  

 The following table sets forth the Company's credit ratings as of February 23, 2009.    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined by the credit agreement, of 3.0x for the trailing four quarters. As of December 31, 2008, the Company's Interest Coverage Ratio was 5.7x.  

 The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its $3.0 billion commercial paper program. At December 31, 2008, the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.80 billion.  

 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program  

 At both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $550.0 million outstanding under its revolving accounts receivable securitization program. The program provides for the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company entered into this arrangement because it provides an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from this program were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization arrangement require that the receivable pools subject to the program meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization program. The program provides for a possible acceleration in the event of a continuing downgrade of the Company's long-term debt to a

below-investment grade rating. The Company believes that it has sufficient capacity under its existing Credit Facility to refinance such program.  

 During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts receivables of $2.77 billion and $2.80 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with securitizing the program's accounts receivables was $15.4 million and $32.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends and principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company believes that its operating cash flows ($2.15 billion in 2008), cash and cash equivalents ($419.5 million at December 31, 2008), borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $2.80 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2008, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, other operating commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments, dividends and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future.  

 The Company's funding will come primarily from cash flows from operations. Any additional net cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that the Company's future operating cash flow is negatively impacted by the continued weakened economy, the Company has the ability to curtail certain non-committed programming, capital and other spending.  

 Although the Company is currently able to access commercial paper markets, there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for the Company given the volatility and disruption in the current capital and credit markets. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy any short-term borrowing needs.  

 In 2010, $1.39 billion of long-term debt is scheduled to mature. The Company anticipates that these future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operating activities and other debt financing.  

 On November 3, 2008, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock, Class B Common Stock (issuable only upon conversion of debt securities and preferred stock) and warrants of CBS Corp. that may be issued by the Company from time to time. The registration statement replaced the previous shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire on December 1, 2008. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by CBS Corp. for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.

 Contractual Obligations  

 As of December 31, 2008, the Company's significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows:    

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $6.89 billion for sports programming rights, $2.53 billion relating to television, radio, and film production and licensing and $814.7 million for talent contracts. 

(b)Outdoor has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 

(c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. 

(d)Consists of long-term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. 

(e)Long-term contractual obligations including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. 

(f)Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt. 

(g)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. 

(h)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.  

 The table above excludes future contributions to the Company's pension plans and $258.3 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and periods in which cash payments relating to these items are expected to occur. The Company expects to contribute approximately $135 million primarily to its non-qualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2009.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Prior to the Separation of Former Viacom into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc., Former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. and Grauman's Theatres LLC. In connection with the Separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the Separation Agreement between the parties.  

 The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31,  

II-28 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

2008, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $362.6 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

 In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates.    

The Company accounts for the production and distribution of television programming in accordance with Statement of Position 00-2 "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00-2"). SOP 00-2 requires management's judgment as it relates to the timing of the establishment of a secondary market for its television programming, and total estimated revenues to be earned and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized television programming, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized television programming costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program, and the past performance of similar television programs. These estimates are updated regularly based on information available as the television program progresses through its life cycle. Overestimating secondary market revenues or a failure to adjust for a downward change in the total estimated revenue could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized television programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and impact the determination of participation expense.   

The Company accounts for its business acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations". The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on   

II-29 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)    

their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items.    

In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. The estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is computed principally based upon the present value of future cash flows. This technique includes projections which require the uses of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, discount rates, future operating margins and capital expenditures. A downward revision in the present value of future cash flows for a reporting unit or intangible assets could result in an impairment under SFAS 142, and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.   

Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods.   

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company determined the discount rate by projecting the plans' expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation. These projected benefit payments are used to construct a high quality bond portfolio with interest and principal payments that provide the cash flows necessary to meet the projected benefit payments. The weighted-average yield of the bond portfolio is used to determine the discount rate. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2008, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased primarily due to a decrease in pension plan asset values. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately $4 million in 2009 pension expense and will change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $116 million. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $7 million in 2009 pension expense.   

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and

recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters, for which a reserve has been established, is audited and finally resolved. During 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized tax benefits of $44.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively, related to the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), the Company evaluates a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $258.3 million at December 31, 2008 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 48.    

In accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), the Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For each award of employee stock options the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on the then current annual dividend rate. Stock price volatility was determined using an average of historical volatility and implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS Corp. options, the Company was able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than one year.   

 Legal Matters  

 Securities Action. On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System filed a self-styled class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company's common stock between February 26, 2008 and October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Company's failure to timely write down the value of certain assets caused the Company's reported operating results during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. On February 11, 2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha, Nebraska Civilian Employees' Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System (collectively,  

II-31 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in this case; and another motion was filed in the case by an individual shareholder also seeking appointment as the lead plaintiff. The parties are awaiting the court's appointment of the lead plaintiff in the case. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation.  

 Indecency Regulation. In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the Company's owned television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half-time show by the Company's television stations. In May 2006, the FCC denied the Company's petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Review of the forfeiture with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Company's ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument was heard in September 2007. In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's order to have the Company pay the forfeiture and remanded the case to the FCC. On November 18, 2008, the FCC filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Third Circuit's decision. The petition requests that the U.S. Supreme Court not act on the petition until it rules in the "fleeting expletives" case mentioned below. On January 8, 2009, the Company filed its opposition to the FCC's petition for certiorari.  

 In March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program  Without a Trace. The FCC proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Company's owned stations. The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures.  

 In June 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCC's November 2006 finding that the broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives on another broadcast network was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC. On March 17, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the FCC's petition to review the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's decision. On November 4, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in this case.  

 Additionally, the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the Company's broadcasting stations included indecent material.  

 Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos, Environmental and Other. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships.  

II-32

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had pending approximately 68,520 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 72,120 as of December 31, 2007 and 73,310 as of December 31, 2006. During 2008, the Company received approximately 6,030 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 9,630 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2008 and 2007 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $15.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.  

 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a relatively small percentage of asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2008. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.  

 The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.  

 General. On an ongoing basis, the Company defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Market Risk  

 The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.   

 Foreign Exchange Risk   

 The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future production costs as cash flow hedges, and may designate certain forward contracts as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in current period results as part of "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the notional amount of all foreign exchange contracts was $95.2 million and $100.3 million, respectively, which represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency cash flows.   

 Interest Rate Risk   

 All of the Company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. The Company had entered into fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements for a portion of this debt, which are designated as fair value hedges. At December 31, 2007, the Company was a party to $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps which were accounted for as fair value hedges. In December 2008, prior to maturity, the Company settled all of its $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $88.4 million in cash.   

 Credit Risk   

 The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.  

 The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2008 or 2007, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold. Some of the Company's customers have been significantly impacted by the current weak economic environment. The Company closely monitors the status of receivables with these customers and believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is currently adequate.

 Adoption of New Accounting Standards  

 Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157") for its financial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings for each reporting period. The adoption of SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008 did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the Company did not elect any eligible items for fair value measurement.  

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition of income tax positions, classification of income tax liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, accounting for uncertain tax positions in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. The adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

 Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88,

106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"). SFAS 158 requires the balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of each defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan as an asset or a liability along with a corresponding after-tax adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in stockholders' equity. The incremental effect of the adoption was a decrease of $51.1 million to stockholders' equity at December 31, 2006.  

 Recent Pronouncements  

 In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("SFAS 161") effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 requires an entity to provide enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities.  

 In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157", which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"), effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill. SFAS 141R also expands disclosure requirements for business combinations.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160") effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
