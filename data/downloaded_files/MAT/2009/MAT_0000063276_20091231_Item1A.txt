Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Factors That May Affect Future Results  

(Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)  

Mattel is including this Cautionary Statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) for forward-looking statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, seeks or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as will, should, could, may, aims, intends, or projects. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. Investors should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements are all based on currently available operating, financial, economic and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The Companys actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below.  

If the current global economic conditions continue to deteriorate, Mattels business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected.  

The global economic conditions adversely impacted Mattels business and financial results in 2009. Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a wide variety of toy products worldwide through sales to customers and directly to consumers. Our performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending, which has deteriorated sharply in the United States and in many countries around the world in which Mattel does business. Consumers discretionary purchases of toy products may be impacted by job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit, significantly falling home prices, lower consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors that affect consumer spending behavior. If our customers encounter liquidity problems due to weak retail sales or their inability to raise sufficient capital due to credit constraints, we may not be able to collect the accounts receivable from the affected customers. Finally, many of the effects and consequences of the current  

12  

Table of Contents 

 global economic conditions are not yet known; any one or all of them could potentially have a material adverse effect on Mattels liquidity and capital resources, including increasing our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital if needed, or otherwise negatively impact Mattels business and financial results.  

If Mattel does not successfully identify or satisfy consumer preferences, its results of operations may be adversely affected.  

Mattels business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of its toy products. Consumer preferences, particularly among end users of Mattels productschildrenare continuously changing. Significant, sudden shifts in demand are caused by hit toys and trends, which are often unpredictable. Mattel offers a diverse range of products for children of all ages and families that includes, among others, toys for infants and preschoolers, girls toys, boys toys, youth electronics, digital media, hand-held and other games, puzzles, educational toys, media-driven products, and fashion-related toys. Mattel competes domestically and internationally with a wide range of large and small manufacturers, marketers and sellers of toys, video games, consumer electronics and other play products, as well as retailers, which means that Mattels market position is always at risk. Mattels ability to maintain its current product sales, and increase its product sales or establish product sales with new, innovative toys, will depend on Mattels ability to satisfy play preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and achieve market acceptance of these products. Competition for access to entertainment properties could lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products or require us to pay licensors higher royalties and higher minimum guaranteed payments in order to obtain or retain these licenses. Competition is intensifying due to recent trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products, the phenomenon of children outgrowing toys at younger ages, and an increasing use of more sophisticated technology in toys. If Mattel does not successfully meet the challenges outlined above in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for its products could decrease, and Mattels revenues, profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected.  

Inaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media and movies, fashion, or technology can negatively affect Mattels sales.  

Successful movies and characters in childrens literature affect play preferences, and many toys depend on media-based intellectual property licenses. Media-based licenses can cause a line of toys to gain immediate success among children, parents, or families. Trends in media, movies, and childrens characters change swiftly and contribute to the transience and uncertainty of play preferences. In addition, certain developments in the entertainment industry, including labor strikes, could cause delay or interruption in the release of new movies and television programs and could adversely affect the sales of Mattels toys based on such movies and television programs. Mattel responds to such trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending, and expanding its product offerings on an annual basis. If Mattel does not accurately anticipate trends in popular culture, movies, media, fashion, or technology, its products may not be accepted by children, parents, or families and Mattels revenues, profitability, and results of operations may be adversely affected.  

Mattels business is highly seasonal and its operating results depend, in large part, on sales during the relatively brief traditional holiday season. Any events that disrupt our business during our peak demand times could significantly, adversely and disproportionately affect Mattels business.  

Mattels business is subject to risks associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Sales of toy products at retail are highly seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December. As a result, Mattels operating results depend, in large part, on sales during the relatively brief traditional holiday season. Retailers attempt to manage their inventories tightly, which requires Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. This in turn results in shorter lead times for production. Management believes that the increase in last minute shopping during the holiday season and the popularity of gift cards (which often shift purchases to after the holiday season) may negatively impact customer re-orders  

13  

Table of Contents 

 during the holiday season. These factors may decrease sales or increase the risks that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that Mattels own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed.  

In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, Mattel may be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, economic shocks, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events, such as strikes, disruptions in transportation or port delays, that interfere with the manufacture or shipment of goods during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.  

Mattel has significant customer concentration, so that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies or patterns of its major customers could have a significant impact on Mattels business and operating results.  

A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattels net sales. In 2009, Mattels three largest customers, Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 40% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 50% of net sales. The concentration of Mattels business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattels large customers were to significantly reduce purchases for any reason, favor competitors or new entrants, or increase their direct competition with Mattel by expanding their private-label business. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to Mattel regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering one-time purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchases of Mattels products, reduce the number and variety of Mattels products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for Mattels products, or otherwise seek to materially change the terms of the business relationship at any time. Any such change could significantly harm Mattels business and operating results.  

Significant increases in the price of commodities, transportation or labor, if not offset by declines in other input costs, or a reduction or interruption in the delivery of raw materials, components and finished products from Mattels vendors could negatively impact Mattels financial results.  

Cost increases, whether resulting from rising costs of materials, compliance with existing or future regulatory requirements, transportation, services and labor could impact the profit margins realized by Mattel on the sale of its products. Because of market conditions, timing of pricing decisions, and other factors, there can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to offset any of these increased costs by adjusting the prices of its products. Increases in prices of Mattels products could result in lower sales. Mattels ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on its ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from its suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity. Mattel has experienced shortages in the past, including shortages of raw materials and components. Although Mattel works closely with suppliers to avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurance that Mattel will not encounter these problems in the future. A reduction or interruption in supplies or in the delivery of finished products, whether resulting from more stringent regulatory requirements, suppliers, disruptions in transportation, port delays, labor strikes, lockouts, or otherwise, or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies, such as fuel or resin (which is an oil-based product), could negatively impact Mattels financial results.  

Significant changes in currency exchange rates or the ability to transfer capital across borders could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business and results of operations.  

Mattels net investment in its foreign subsidiaries and its results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in currency exchange rates and regulations. Mattel seeks to mitigate the exposure of its results of operations to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by partially hedging this exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts. These contracts are primarily used to hedge Mattels purchase and sale of inventory,  

14  

Table of Contents 

 and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Government action may restrict Mattels ability to transfer capital across borders and may also impact the fluctuation of currencies in the countries where Mattel conducts business or has invested capital. Significant changes in currency exchange rates, reductions in Mattels ability to transfer its capital across borders, and changes in government-fixed currency exchange rates, including the Chinese yuan and Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business and results of operations.  

Failure to successfully implement new initiatives could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Mattel has announced, and in the future may announce, initiatives to reduce its costs, increase its efficiency, improve the execution of its core business, globalize and extend Mattels brands, catch new trends, create new brands, and offer new innovative products, enhance product safety, develop people, improve productivity, simplify processes, maintain customer service levels, as well as initiatives designed to drive sales growth, capitalize on Mattels scale advantage, and improve its supply chain. These initiatives involve investment of capital and complex decision-making as well as extensive and intensive execution, and the success of these initiatives is not assured. Failure to successfully implement any of these initiatives, or the failure of any of these initiatives to produce the results anticipated by management, could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition, and results of operations.  

Mattels business depends in large part on the success of its vendors and outsourcers, and Mattels brands and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by third-parties that are outside Mattels control. In addition, any material failure, inadequacy or interruption resulting from such vendors or outsourcings could harm Mattels ability to effectively operate its business.  

As a part of our efforts to cut costs, achieve better efficiencies and increase productivity and service quality, Mattel relies significantly on vendor and outsourcing relationships with third parties for services and systems including manufacturing, transportation, logistics and information technology. Any shortcoming of a Mattel vendor or outsourcer, particularly an issue affecting the quality of these services or systems, may be attributed by customers to Mattel, thus damaging Mattels reputation, brand value and potentially affecting the results of operations. In addition, problems with transitioning these services and systems or operating failures with these vendors and outsourcers could cause delays in product sales, reduce efficiency of Mattels operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.  

Increases in interest rates, reduction of Mattels credit ratings, contraction of credit availability or the inability of Mattel to meet the debt covenant requirements in its credit facilities could negatively impact Mattels ability to conduct its operations.  

Increases in interest rates, both domestically and internationally, could negatively affect Mattels cost of financing its operations. Any reduction in Mattels credit ratings could increase the cost of obtaining financing. Mattel may be hindered from obtaining, or incur additional costs to obtain, additional credit in light of the current tight credit market environment. Additionally, Mattels ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as market conditions and an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements, which include maintaining certain financial ratios. Mattels ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity.  

Liquidity problems or bankruptcy of Mattels key customers could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Many of Mattels key customers are mass-market retailers. In the past, the mass-market retail channel in the US has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors, causing some large retailers to  

15  

Table of Contents 

 experience liquidity problems. Certain of Mattels customers filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and 2009 and the current global economic conditions have adversely affected the financial condition of most retailers. Mattels sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy, contraction of credit availability to such customers or other factors beyond the control of Mattel, which could increase Mattels exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if these or other customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce the number of stores operated, it could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition, and results of operations.  

If Mattel is not able to adequately protect its proprietary intellectual property and information, its results of operations could be adversely affected.  

The value of Mattels business depends on its ability to protect its intellectual property and information, including its trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets, in the US and around the world, as well as its customer, employee, and consumer data. If Mattel fails to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information, including any successful challenge to Mattels ownership of its intellectual property or material infringements of its intellectual property, could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition, and results of operations.  

Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters, and disputes, including those arising from recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of Mattel products, could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels financial condition.  

Mattel is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory matters, including those arising from recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of Mattel products. An unfavorable resolution of these pending matters could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels financial condition and its operations. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending matters. In addition to the pending matters, future litigation, government proceedings, labor disputes, or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of Mattels normal business operations.  

Mattel is subject to various laws and government regulations, violation of which could subject it to sanctions. In addition, changes in such laws or regulations may lead to increased costs, changes in Mattels effective tax rate, or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact Mattels financial condition and results of operations.  

Mattel operates in a highly regulated environment in the US and international markets. US federal, state and local governmental entities, and foreign governments regulate many aspects of Mattels business, including its products and the importation and exportation of its products. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), product safety and other safety standards, trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, advertising directed toward children, product content, and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. While Mattel takes all the steps it believes are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that Mattel will be in compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could have a negative impact on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations.  

16

In addition, changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs, changes in Mattels effective tax rate, or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations.  

Product recalls, product liability claims, absence or cost of insurance, and associated costs could increase governmental scrutiny, divert resources, reduce sales and increase costs and could have a significant adverse effect on Mattels financial condition.  

Mattel has experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. Testing implemented by Mattel, as well as scrutiny by retailers, consumers, and other parties, may reveal issues in Mattel products that may lead to recalls, withdrawals, replacement of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. In addition, individuals have asserted claims, and may in the future assert claims, that they have sustained injuries from Mattels products, and Mattel is and may be subject to lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside of the scope of, Mattels insurance coverage. Moreover, Mattel may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in increased governmental scrutiny, diversion of development and management resources, and reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could significantly and adversely affect Mattels financial condition.  

Product recalls may harm Mattels reputation and acceptance of Mattels products by consumers, licensors and Mattels retailer customers, which may significantly and adversely affect its business operations, decrease sales and increase costs. Recalls may also increase competitive pressures from other toy manufacturers.  

Product recalls, withdrawals, or replacements have resulted in coverage critical of Mattel in the press and media. While Mattel believes that it has acted responsibly and in the interests of safety, product recalls, withdrawals, or replacements may harm Mattels reputation and the acceptance of its products by consumers, licensors, and retailers. Mattels ability to enter into licensing agreements for products on competitive terms may be adversely affected if licensors believe that products sold by Mattel will be less favorably received in the market. Mattels retailer customers may be less willing to purchase Mattel products or to provide marketing support for those products, such as shelf space, promotions, and advertising, or have imposed or may impose additional requirements or product changes that would adversely affect Mattels business operations, decrease sales, and increase costs. Product recalls, withdrawals, or replacements may also increase the amount of competition that Mattel confronts from other manufacturers. Some competitors may attempt to differentiate themselves from Mattel by claiming that their products are produced in a manner or geographic area that is insulated from the issues that preceded recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of Mattel products. To the extent that competitive manufacturers choose not to implement enhanced safety and testing protocols comparable to those that Mattel has adopted, those competitors could enjoy a cost advantage that will enable them to offer products at lower prices than those charged by Mattel.  

Mattels current and future safety procedures may increase costs, significantly and adversely affect its relationship with vendors and make it more difficult for Mattel to produce, purchase and deliver products on a timely basis to meet market demands. Future conditions may require Mattel to adopt further changes that may increase its costs and further affect its relationship with vendors.   

Mattels current operating procedures and requirements, including testing requirements and standards, have imposed costs on both Mattel and the vendors from which it purchases products. Changes in business conditions, including those resulting from new legislative and regulatory requirements, will cause further revisions in Mattels operating procedures and requirements. Changes in Mattels operating procedures and requirements may delay delivery of products and increase costs. Mattels relationship with its existing vendors may be adversely affected as a result of these changes, making Mattel more dependent on a smaller number of vendors. Some vendors may choose not to continue to do business with Mattel or not to accommodate Mattels needs to  

17  

Table of Contents 

 the extent that they have done in the past. In addition, rising production costs, contraction of credit availability and labor shortages have caused a substantial contraction in the number of toy manufacturers in China, decreasing the number of potential vendors to manufacture Mattels products. Because of the seasonal nature of Mattels business and the demands of its customers for deliveries with short lead times, Mattel depends upon the cooperation of its vendors to meet market demand for its products in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that existing and future events will not require Mattel to adopt additional requirements and incur additional costs, and impose those requirements and costs on its vendors, which may adversely affect its relationship with those vendors and Mattels ability to meet market demand in a timely manner.  

Political developments, including trade relations, and the threat or occurrence of war or terrorist activities could adversely impact Mattel, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, retail and financial markets, and general economic conditions.  

Mattels business is worldwide in scope, including operations in 43 countries and territories. The deterioration of the political situation in a country in which Mattel has significant sales or operations, or the breakdown of trade relations between the US and a foreign country in which Mattel has significant manufacturing facilities or other operations, could adversely affect Mattels business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, a change in trade status for China could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of toys manufactured in China and imported into the US. In addition, the occurrence of war or hostilities between countries or threat of terrorist activities, and the responses to and results of these activities, could adversely impact Mattel, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, retail and financial markets, and general economic conditions.  

Disruptions in Mattels manufacturing operations due to political instability, civil unrest, or disease could negatively impact Mattels business, financial position and results of operations.  

Mattel owns, operates and manages manufacturing facilities and utilizes third-party manufacturers throughout Asia, primarily in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The risk of political instability and civil unrest exists in certain of these countries, which could temporarily or permanently damage Mattels manufacturing operations located there. In the past, outbreaks of SARS have been significantly concentrated in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, and in the Guangdong province of China, where many of Mattels manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers are located. The design, development and manufacture of Mattels products could suffer if a significant number of Mattels employees or the employees of its third-party manufacturers or their suppliers contract SARS, avian flu or other communicable diseases, or otherwise are unable to fulfill their responsibilities. Mattel has developed contingency plans designed to help mitigate the impact of disruptions in its manufacturing operations. Mattels business, financial position, and results of operations could be negatively impacted by a significant disruption to its manufacturing operations or suppliers.  

Earthquakes or other catastrophic events out of our control may damage Mattels facilities or those of its contractors and harm Mattels results of operations.  

Mattel has significant operations near major earthquake faults, including its corporate headquarters in Southern California. A catastrophic event where Mattel has important operations, such as an earthquake, tsunami, flood, typhoon, fire, or other natural or manmade disaster, could disrupt Mattels operations or those of its contractors and impair production or distribution of its products, damage inventory, interrupt critical functions, or otherwise affect its business negatively, harming Mattels results of operations.  

The production and sale of private-label toys by Mattels retail customers may result in lower purchases of Mattel-branded products by those retail customers.  

In recent years, consumer goods companies generally, including those in the toy business, have experienced the phenomenon of retail customers developing their own private-label products that directly compete with the  

18  

Table of Contents 

 products of traditional manufacturers. Some retail chains that are customers of Mattel sell private-label toys designed, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. These toys may be sold at prices lower than comparable toys sold by Mattel and may result in lower purchases of Mattel-branded products by these retailers. In some cases, retailers who sell these private-label toys are larger than Mattel and may have substantially more resources than Mattel.  

Mattels failure to successfully market or advertise its products could have an adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Mattels products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Mattels ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If Mattel does not successfully market its products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition, and results of operations.  

Mattel depends on key personnel and may not be able to hire, retain and integrate sufficient qualified personnel to maintain and expand its business.  

Mattels future success depends partly on the continued contribution of key executives, designers, technical, sales, marketing, manufacturing, and administrative personnel. The loss of services of any of Mattels key personnel could harm Mattels business. Recruiting and retaining skilled personnel is costly and highly competitive. If Mattel fails to retain, hire, train, and integrate qualified employees and contractors, Mattel may not be able to maintain and expand its business.  

Mattel may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, which may affect the profit, revenues, profit margins, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of Mattels business. In addition, Mattel has certain anti-takeover provisions in its by-laws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Mattel without its consent, which may adversely affect Mattels stock price.  

Mattel may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, which may affect the profit, revenues, profit margins, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures, or other aspects of Mattels business. There can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or that, if identified, it will be able to acquire these targets on acceptable terms or agree to terms with merger partners. There can also be no assurance that Mattel will be successful in integrating any acquired company into its overall operations, or that any such acquired company will operate profitably or will not otherwise adversely impact Mattels results of operations. Further, Mattel cannot be certain that key talented individuals at these acquired companies will continue to work for Mattel after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services. In addition, Mattel has certain anti-takeover provisions in its bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Mattel without its consent, which may adversely affect Mattels stock price.  

The level of returns on pension plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings in future periods. Changes in standards and government regulations could also affect our pension plan expense and funding requirements.  

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care costs, our future pension benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental authorities.

If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors listed above actually occurs, Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. The factors listed above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, Mattel operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all of these factors on Mattels business, financial condition or results of operations, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other public statement made by Mattel or its representatives may turn out to be wrong. Mattel expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.
