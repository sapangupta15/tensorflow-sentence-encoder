Morgan Stanleys Operations and Information Technology departments provide or oversee the process and technology platform required to support its asset management business.

These activities are undertaken through Morgan Stanleys own facilities, through membership in various clearing and settlement organizations, and through agreements with unaffiliated third parties.  

 Competition.  

All aspects of Morgan Stanleys businesses are highly competitive and Morgan Stanley expects them to remain so. Morgan Stanley competes in the U.S. and globally for clients, market share and human talent in all aspects of its business segments. Morgan Stanleys competitive position depends on its reputation and the quality of its products, services and advice. Morgan Stanleys ability to sustain or improve its competitive position also depends substantially on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs. Morgan Stanley competes with commercial banks, insurance companies, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and through the internet.  

Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management Group.  

Morgan Stanleys competitive position depends on innovation, execution capability and relative pricing. Morgan Stanley competes directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers, and with others on a regional or product basis.

Table of Contents 

Morgan Stanleys ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is generally dependent on Morgan Stanleys credit ratings) and to commit capital efficiently, particularly in its capital-intensive underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects its competitive position. Corporate clients continue to request that Morgan Stanley provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities.  

Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This convergence could result in Morgan Stanleys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. It is possible that competition may become even more intense as Morgan Stanley continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain areas. Many of these firms have greater capital than Morgan Stanley and have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure in our businesses. The complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require effective resource allocation in order for Morgan Stanley to remain competitive.  

Morgan Stanley has experienced intense price competition in some of its businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute securities trades electronically on exchanges and through other automated trading markets has increased the pressure on trading commissions. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic stock markets will likely continue. It is possible that Morgan Stanley will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of its competitors may seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.  

Asset Management.  

Competition in the asset management industry is affected by several factors, including Morgan Stanleys reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment products relative to peers and an appropriate benchmark index, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, and the types and quality of products offered. Morgan Stanleys alternative investment products, such as private equity funds, real estate and hedge funds, compete with similar products offered by both alternative and traditional asset managers.  

 Regulation.  

Most aspects of Morgan Stanleys business are subject to stringent regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by non-U.S. government agencies or regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. Aspects of Morgan Stanleys public disclosure, corporate governance principles, internal control environment and the roles of auditors and counsel are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations and rules of the SEC and the NYSE.  

New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof) either in the U.S. or elsewhere could materially adversely affect Morgan Stanleys financial condition or results of operations. As a global financial institution, to the extent that different regulatory regimes impose inconsistent or iterative requirements on the conduct of its business, Morgan Stanley faces complexity and additional costs in its compliance efforts.  

Consolidated Supervision and Revised Capital Standards.  

Effective December 1, 2005, Morgan Stanley became a consolidated supervised entity (CSE) as defined by the SEC. As such, Morgan Stanley is subject to group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. Morgan Stanleys European regulated entities implemented Basel II capital standards on January 1, 2008. Morgan Stanley continues to work with its regulators on the implementation of the CSE rules and Basel II capital standards.

Anti-Money Laundering.  

Morgan Stanleys Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program is coordinated on an enterprise-wide basis. In the U.S., for example, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the USA PATRIOT Act) imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, broker-dealers and mutual funds to identify and verify customers that maintain accounts. The USA PATRIOT Act also mandates that certain types of financial institutions monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. An institution subject to the USA PATRIOT Act also must designate an AML compliance officer, provide employees with training on money laundering prevention, and undergo an annual, independent audit to assess the effectiveness of its AML program. Outside the U.S., applicable laws and regulations similarly subject designated types of financial institutions to AML requirements. Morgan Stanley has implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these AML requirements.  

Protection of Client Information.  

Many aspects of Morgan Stanleys business are subject to increasingly comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain client information, including those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the European Union Data Protection Directive in the EU and various laws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal Information (Protection) Law, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act. Morgan Stanley has adopted measures in response to such requirements.  

Institutional Securities and Global Wealth Management Group.  

Broker-Dealer Regulation. MS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and is a member of self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and securities exchanges, including the NYSE. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and retention and the conduct of their directors, officers, representatives and other associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Violations of the laws and regulations governing a broker-dealers actions could result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar consequences by both federal and state securities administrators.  

Margin lending by broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserve Boards restrictions on lending in connection with customer and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities. Broker-dealers are also required by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and NYSE rules to impose maintenance requirements on the value of securities contained in margin accounts. In many cases, Morgan Stanleys broker-dealer subsidiaries margin policies are more stringent than these rules.  

Morgan Stanley conducts some of its government securities activities through Morgan Stanley Market Products Inc., a FINRA member registered as a government securities broker-dealer with the SEC and in certain states. The Department of Treasury has promulgated regulations concerning, among other things, capital adequacy, custody and use of government securities and transfers and control of government securities subject to repurchase transactions. The rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which are enforced by FINRA, govern the municipal securities activities of Morgan Stanley.  

As registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley, including MS&Co., are subject to the SECs net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various securities exchanges. Many non-U.S. securities exchanges and regulatory authorities either have imposed or are proposing rules relating to capital requirements   

9  

Table of Contents 

 applicable to Morgan Stanleys non-U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries. These rules, which specify minimum capital requirements, are generally designed to measure general financial integrity and liquidity and require that at least a minimum amount of net assets be kept in relatively liquid form. See also Consolidated Supervision and Revised Capital Standards above and Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Rules of FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations also impose limitations and requirements on the transfer of member organizations assets.  

Compliance with the capital requirements may limit Morgan Stanleys operations requiring the intensive use of capital. Such requirements restrict Morgan Stanleys ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer subsidiaries, which in turn may limit its ability to pay dividends, repay debt or redeem or purchase shares of its own outstanding stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely affect Morgan Stanleys ability to pay dividends or to expand or maintain present business levels. In addition, such rules may require Morgan Stanley to make substantial capital infusions into one or more of its broker-dealer subsidiaries in order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules, either in the form of cash or subordinated loans made in accordance with the requirements of the SECs net capital rule.  

Regulation of Certain Commodities Activities. The commodities activities in the Institutional Securities business segment are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety, and other governmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. Intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by U.S. federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement and remedial proceedings involving energy companies, including those engaged in power generation and liquid hydrocarbons trading. The EU has increased its focus on the energy markets, which has resulted in increased regulation of companies participating in the energy markets, including those engaged in power generation and liquid hydrocarbons trading.  

Terminal facilities and other assets relating to Morgan Stanleys commodities activities are also subject to environmental laws both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, pipeline, transport and terminal operations are subject to state laws in connection with the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal.  

Additional Regulation of U.S. Entities. As a registered futures commission merchant, MS&Co. is subject to the net capital requirements of, and its activities are regulated by, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and various commodity exchanges. Certain subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators. Morgan Stanleys futures and options-on-futures businesses are also regulated by the National Futures Association (the NFA), a registered futures association, of which MS&Co. and certain of its affiliates are members. Violations of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity exchanges could result in remedial actions including fines, registration restrictions or terminations, trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships.  

Morgan Stanley Bank, through which Morgan Stanley conducts certain financing and lending activities, is an industrial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Utah. It has deposits that are eligible for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in accordance with FDIC rules and is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Morgan Stanley Bank is not considered a bank under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA).

Morgan Stanley Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary which conducts certain transfer agency, sub-accounting and other activities, is a federally chartered savings bank whose activities are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). As a result of its ownership of Morgan Stanley Trust, Morgan Stanley is registered with the OTS as a unitary savings and loan holding company (SLHC) and subject to regulation and examination by the OTS as a SLHC. Subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley, including Morgan Stanley Trust, are registered transfer agents subject to regulation and examination by the SEC. Morgan Stanley Trust has deposits that are eligible for insurance by the FDIC.  

Non-U.S. Regulation. Morgan Stanleys businesses are also regulated extensively by non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which Morgan Stanley maintains an office. As Morgan Stanley continues to expand its business internationally, including in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, it will become subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. Certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries are regulated as broker-dealers under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries engaged in banking and trust activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance, the Financial Services Authority and several U.K. securities and futures exchanges, including the London Stock Exchange and Euronext.liffe regulate the Companys activities in the U.K.; the Deutsche Borse AG and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) regulate its activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; the Swiss Federal Banking Commission regulates its activities in Switzerland; the Comisión Nacional del Mercado del Valores (C.N.M.V.) regulates its activities in Spain; the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of Japan, the Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese securities and futures exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange and the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange, regulate its activities in Japan; the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited regulate its operations in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Limited regulate its business in Singapore.  

Research. Both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators continue to focus on research conflicts of interest. Research-related regulations have been implemented in many jurisdictions and are proposed or under consideration in other jurisdictions. New and revised requirements resulting from these regulations and the global research settlement with U.S. Federal and state regulators (to which Morgan Stanley is a party) have necessitated the development or enhancement of corresponding policies and procedures.  

Asset Management.  

The majority of subsidiaries related to Morgan Stanleys asset management activities and others, including MS&Co., are registered as investment advisers with the SEC, and, in certain states, some employees or representatives of subsidiaries are registered as investment adviser representatives. Many aspects of Morgan Stanleys asset management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict Morgan Stanley from carrying on its asset management activities in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for such failure include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on Morgan Stanley engaging in various asset management activities for specified periods of time, the revocation of registrations, other censures and fines.  

Morgan Stanleys Asset Management business is also regulated outside the U.S. For example, the Financial Services Authority regulates Morgan Stanleys business in the U.K.; the Financial Services Agency regulates Morgan Stanleys business in Japan; the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulates Morgan Stanleys business in India; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates Morgan Stanleys business in Singapore.
