ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview  

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate two casino resort complexes. In Las Vegas, Nevada, we own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort which opened on April 28, 2005. In December 2008, we expanded Wynn Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas resort as our Las Vegas Operations. In the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), we own and operate Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006. On April 21, 2010 we opened Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau as our Macau Operations.  

Our Resorts  

The following table sets forth information about our resorts as of February 2012:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Las Vegas Operations  

Wynn Las Vegas I Encore is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, and occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. In addition, we own approximately 18 acres across Sands Avenue, a portion of which is utilized for employee parking, and approximately 5 acres adjacent to the golf course on which an office building is located.  

Our Las Vegas resort complex features:  

       Approximately 186,000 square feet of casino space, offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, a sky casino, a poker room, and a race and sports book;  

       Two luxury hotel towers with a total of 4,750 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas;  

       35 food and beverage outlets featuring signature chefs;  

       A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership;  

       Approximately 97,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques by Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Hermes, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta, Vertu and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18-hole golf course, swimming pools, private cabanas and two full service spas and salons;  

       Two showrooms; and  

       Three nightclubs and a beach club.  

In January 2011, we completed a refurbishment and upgrade to the resort rooms at Wynn Las Vegas. A remodel of the suites was completed in early May 2011. These remodels were completed at a cost of $61 million.

In response to our evaluation of our Las Vegas Operations and the reactions of our guests, we have and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.  

Macau Operations  

We operate Wynn Macau I Encore under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002.  

Our Macau resort complex features:  

       Approximately 265,000 square feet of casino space, offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, sky casinos and a poker pit;  

       Two luxury hotel towers with a total of 1,008 spacious rooms and suites;  

       Casual and fine dining in eight restaurants;  

       Approximately 54,200 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques by Bvlgari, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Tudor, Vacheron Constantin, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu, Zegna and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including two health clubs and spas, a salon, a pool; and  

       Lounges and meeting facilities.  

In response to our evaluation of our Macau Operations and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.  

Future Development  

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising our Las Vegas Operations is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this property in the future, we have no immediate plans to do so.  

In September 2011, Palo Real Estate Company Limited and Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A., each an indirect subsidiary of Wynn Macau Limited, formally accepted the terms and conditions of a draft land concession contract from the Macau government, and in December 2011 made a $62.5 million initial deposit for approximately 51 acres of land in the Cotai area of Macau. Following government approval, we anticipate constructing a full scale integrated resort containing a casino, approximately 2,000 hotel suites, convention, retail, entertainment and food and beverage offerings on this land. We continue to finalize the project scope, timeline and budget.  

Results of Operations  

Our operating results in Macau were significantly higher in 2011 as the Macau market continued to grow, and the Las Vegas market began to improve with increased levels of gaming revenue, visitation, and hotel room demand. Our results for the years presented are not comparable as the year ended December 31, 2011 includes a full year of operations for Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010.  

The table below presents our net revenues (amounts in thousands):

Table of Contents 

Reliance on only two resort complexes (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more geographically diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes, many of our customers are premium gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.  

Operating Measures  

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented. There are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry. In Las Vegas and in the general casino in Macau, customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables. The cash and net markers used to purchase the cash chips are deposited in the gaming tables drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our Las Vegas Operations and in the general casino at our Macau Operations for calculating win percentage.  

In our VIP casino in Macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable chips, commonly referred to as rolling chips, from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage. Non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the non-negotiable chips in the VIP casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP casino win percentage. Because of this difference in chip purchase activity, the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the VIP casino. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP casino play using this rolling chip method.  

The measurement method in Las Vegas and in the general casino in Macau tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table while the measurement method in our VIP casino in Macau tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement in the VIP casino is much larger than the general casino. As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the VIP casino in Macau when compared to the general casino in Las Vegas and Macau.  

Even though both use the same measurement method, we experience different win percentages in the general casino activity in Las Vegas versus Macau. This difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games and customer playing habits between the two casinos. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. In the second quarter of 2011, we increased our expectations for table games win percentage in the general casino at Wynn Macau from 21% - 23% to 26% - 28% based on our experience since the opening of the Encore at Wynn Macau expansion.  

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:  

       Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.  

       Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box.  

       Turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Macau VIP program.  

       Rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track VIP wagering volume (turnover) for purposes of calculating incentives.  

       Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.  

       Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.  

       Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 are comprised of $4,190.5 million in casino revenues (79.5% of total net revenues) and $1,079.3 million of net non-casino revenues (20.5% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 are comprised of $3,245.1 million in casino revenues (77.5% of total net revenues) and $939.6 million of net non-casino revenues (22.5% of total net revenues).  

Casino revenues are primarily comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $4,190.5 million represents a $945.4 million (29.1%) increase from casino revenues of $3,245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  

Our Las Vegas Operations experienced a $90.9 million (17%) increase in casino revenues to $625.2 million, compared to the prior year due to a 9.9% increase in drop and an increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 24.9%, which was above the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 22.2% for the prior year. Slot machine handle at our Las Vegas Operations increased slightly compared to the prior year; however slot machine win increased 7.0% as more play shifted to higher hold slot machines.  

Our Macau Operations experienced an $854.5 million (31.5%) increase in casino revenues to $3,565.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year. Our VIP revenue segment increased 28.9% due to a 34.9% increase in turnover, offset by a lower win percentage, all compared to the prior year. Our win as a percent of turnover was 2.93%, which is within our expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%, and compares to 3.0% in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we benefited from an increase in the number of VIP tables and a full year of operations from Encore at Wynn Macau which opened in April 2010. In our general casino, drop increased 18.1% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 28.4%, which is slightly above our expected range of 26% to 28%. The average table game win percentage for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 23.6%. Slot machine handle increased 28.4% compared to the prior year as a result of increased visitation to our resort and a full year of operations for Encore at Wynn Macau. Slot machine win increased 26.8% due to the increased handle partially offset by a slight decrease in hold percentage.  

For the year ended December 31, 2011, room revenues were $472.1 million, an increase of $71.8 million (17.9%) compared to prior year room revenue of $400.3 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations increased $45.6 million (14.8%) compared to the prior year. In Las Vegas, we experienced an increase in room rates during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year, with a 1.9 percentage point decrease in occupancy rate. We were able to achieve an increase in ADR as we adjusted rates to attract a higher quality customer who would take advantage of all aspects of our resort. Room revenue at our Macau Operations increased $26.2 million (28.5%) due to increases in both occupancy rate and room rates compared to the prior year, as well as the inclusion of a full year of the 414 additional suites added with the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau in April 2010.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, included food and beverage revenues of $547.7 million, retail revenues of $260.8 million, entertainment revenues of $82.2 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of $71.8 million. Other non-gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, included food and beverage revenues of $488.1 million, retail revenues of $214.6 million, entertainment revenues of $72 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of $67.7 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased $37.5 million (9.0%), while our Macau Operations increased $22.1 million (31.3%), as compared to the prior year. The increase in Las Vegas is due primarily to business in our nightclubs including the full year of operations for the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub (which opened in May 2010) and increases in our catering and restaurant business. The increase in Macau is due to increased visitation to our resort and a full year of operations from Encore at Wynn Macau which opened in April 2010. Retail revenues at our Macau Operations increased $42.6 million (32.3%), while retail at our Las Vegas Operations increased by $3.6 million (4.3%). The increase at Wynn Macau is due primarily to strong same-store sales growth and the addition of three new boutiques at Encore at Wynn Macau. Entertainment revenues increased $10.2 million (14.1%) over the prior year primarily due to increased revenue from Garth Brooks, who performs in the Encore Theater, and the Sinatra Dance with Me show, both in Las Vegas. The Sinatra Dance with Me show ended its run on April 23, 2011.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

For the year ended December 31, 2011, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2,686.4 million, room expenses of $125.3 million, food and beverage expenses of $283.9 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $214.4 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $389.1 million and $33.8 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2010, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2,100.1 million, room expenses of $122.3 million, food and beverage expenses of $272.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $204.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $391.3 million and approximately $28.3 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in casino revenues at both of our Las Vegas Operations and at our Macau Operations (where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with the concession agreement). Although our room revenues increased 17.9%, room expenses increased only 2.5% as the revenue increase was driven primarily by increased ADR. Food and beverage and entertainment, retail and other expenses increased commensurate with the increase in revenues. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to Wynn Las Vegas and is a result of the higher casino revenue base experienced during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year.  

Pre-opening costs  

We incurred no pre-opening costs during the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $9.5 million of pre-opening costs primarily related to Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010 and the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub which opened in Las Vegas on May 28, 2010.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $398 million compared to $405.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. While there was little change between periods, depreciation expense decreased due to assets with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of September 2011 at Wynn Macau and assets with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of April 2010 at Wynn Las Vegas. These decreases were offset by additional depreciation for the assets of Encore at Wynn Macau which were placed into service in April 2010 and the assets of the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub in Las Vegas which were placed into service in May 2010.

Table of Contents 

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at our Macau Operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to our Macau Operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $130.6 million compared to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2011 include a charge of $109.6 million reflecting the present value of a charitable contribution made by Wynn Macau to the University of Macau Development Foundation. This contribution consists of a $25 million payment made in May 2011, and a commitment for additional donations of $10 million each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive, for a total of $135 million. The amount reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income has been discounted using our then estimated borrowing rate over the time period of the remaining committed payments. Also included are the write off of certain off-site golf memberships by Wynn Las Vegas, miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts, including modifications of the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau retail esplanades, closure of the Blush nightclub and the write off of certain costs related to a show that ended its run in Las Vegas in April 2011.  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010, include a contract termination payment of $14.9 million related to a management contract for certain of the nightclubs at Wynn Las Vegas and miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and gain/loss on sale of equipment at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $7.7 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011 and 2010, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. While the majority of our short-term investments were primarily in money market accounts, U.S. Treasury Bills and time deposits with a maturity of three months or less, beginning in May 2011 we have invested in certain corporate bond securities and commercial paper which contributed to the increase in interest income.  

Interest expense was $229.9 million, net of capitalized interest of $0, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $222.9 million, net of capitalized interest of $7.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in interest capitalized and an increase in interest rates on our first mortgage notes, offset by a decrease in amounts outstanding under our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau bank credit revolving facilities compared to the prior year.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded a gain of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an expense of $0.9 million resulting from the decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

In April 2010, we completed an exchange offer for a portion of our outstanding 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes (the 2014 Notes). In connection with that exchange offer, the direct costs incurred with third parties of $4.4 million were expensed. In August 2010, we completed a tender offer for the then outstanding 2014 Notes  

41  

Table of Contents 

 and subsequent call of all the remaining amounts once the tender was completed. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $63 million. This included the tender offer consideration, the call premium and the related write off of the unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount.  

Income Taxes  

For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $19.5 million. Our income tax benefit is primarily related to tax benefits resulting from an increase in our deferred tax assets, a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions as the result of the statute of limitations lapse reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of Wynn Macau, S.A. and foreign tax provisions related to our international marketing offices. Since June 30, 2010, we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited to be permanently invested. No additional U.S. tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently invested as we anticipate that U.S. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any U.S. tax provision relating to such repatriation. To the extent that book earnings exceed the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited, such excess is considered permanently invested. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized income tax benefits related to excess tax deductions associated with stock compensation costs of $11.2 million and $10.5 million, respectively.  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau, S.A. received an additional 5-year exemption through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $82.7 million and $64.4 million in such taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.  

During the year ended December 31, 2011, Wynn Macau, S.A. received the results of the Macau Finance Bureaus examination of its 2006 and 2007 Macau Complementary Tax returns and filed an appeal related to the examinations disallowance of certain deductions claimed in its 2006 Macau Complementary Tax Return. In August 2011, the 2006 Macau tax issues under appeal were resolved. As part of the settlement, the Company paid $1.1 million in Macau Complementary tax substantially all of which was provided for in prior years. As the result of the resolution of these Macau tax issues and expiration of the statute of limitations for 2006 Macau Complementary tax assessments on December 31, 2011, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased $10.8 million.  

During 2010, we received the results of an IRS examination of our 2006 through 2008 U.S. income tax returns and filed an appeal of the examinations findings with the Appellate division of the IRS. In connection with that appeal, we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our 2006 and 2007 U.S. income tax returns to December 31, 2012. The issues under examination in these years are temporary differences and relate to the treatment of discounts extended to Las Vegas casino customers gambling on credit, the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets. Upon the settlement of these issues, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $0 to $54 million. The resolution of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward.  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the IRS commenced an examination of our 2009 U.S. income tax return. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions related to the period covered by the examination is adequate. The resolution of the 2009 IRS examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward.  

42  

Table of Contents 

During October 2011, the IRS began an examination of our 2010 U.S. income tax return. Since the examination is in its initial stages we are unable to determine if it will be concluded within the next twelve months. We believe our liability for uncertain tax positions related to the period covered by this examination is adequate.  

We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (CAP) for the 2011 tax year. Under the CAP program, the IRS and the taxpayer work together in a pre-filing environment to examine transactions and issues and thus complete the tax examination before the tax return is filed. Participation in this program should enable us to reduce time spent on tax administration and enhance tax reserve and financial statement reporting integrity. In January 2012, we received notification that we had been accepted into the IRS CAP for the 2012 tax year.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock through an initial public offering. We recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $211.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This represents the noncontrolling interests share of net income from Wynn Macau, Limited for each year.  

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 are comprised of $3,245.1 million in casino revenues (77.5% of total net revenues) and $939.6 million of net non-casino revenues (22.5% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were comprised of $2,206.8 million in casino revenues (72.5% of total net revenues) and $838.8 million of net non-casino revenues (27.5% of total net revenues).  

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $3,245.1 million represents a $1,038.3 million (or 47%) increase from casino revenues of $2,206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  

Our Las Vegas Operations experienced a $28.5 million increase in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a 3.4% increase in drop and an increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 22.2% which was within the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 20.2% for the prior year. Slot handle at our Las Vegas Operations decreased 18.3% compared to the prior year; however slot win decreased only 6.9% as more play shifted to higher hold machines.  

Casino revenues at our Macau Operations increased $1,009.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the prior year. We experienced a 77.8% increase in the VIP revenue segment due to a 68.0% increase in turnover. Our win as a percent of turnover was 3.0%, which is at the high end of the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%, and compares to 2.9% in the prior year. In November 2009 we added two new private gaming salons with 29 VIP tables and on April 21, 2010 we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau, which helped drive some of the growth in our VIP segment during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play. In our general casino, drop increased 17.4% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 23.6%, which is above the expected range of 19% to 21%. The average table game win percentage for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 21.9%. Slot handle increased 23.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau and slot win increased by 29.8%.

Table of Contents 

For the year ended December 31, 2010, room revenues were approximately $400.3 million, an increase of $22.8 million compared to prior year room revenue of $377.5 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations decreased approximately $12.7 million compared to the prior year. In Las Vegas, we continued to experience a decrease in room rates during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. We believe this was due to the economic conditions in the U.S. and the increased capacity in the Las Vegas market including the opening of a new large scale casino hotel in Las Vegas in December 2009. In addition, in July 2010, we commenced a project to remodel all of the rooms at Wynn Las Vegas. Accordingly, we had 3.8% fewer room nights available during the year ended December 31, 2010 which had a negative impact on our room revenues in Las Vegas. This room remodel was completed in the second quarter of 2011. Room revenue at our Macau Operations increased approximately $35.5 million due to the 414 additional suites added with Encore at Wynn Macau and an increase in the average daily room rate compared to the prior year.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, included food and beverage revenues of approximately $488.1 million, retail revenues of approximately $214.6 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $72 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $67.7 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, included food and beverage revenues of approximately $436.4 million, retail revenues of approximately $165.1 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $57.1 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $66.2 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased approximately $31.4 million, while our Macau Operations increased $20.3 million, as compared to the prior year. The increase in Las Vegas is due primarily to business in our nightclubs including the opening of the Encore Beach Club and Surrender nightclub in May 2010. The increase in Macau is primarily due to the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau and increased visitation to our resort. Retail revenues at our Macau Operations increased $52.2 million, offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in Las Vegas. The increase in Macau is due primarily to increased sales at several outlets, the opening of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry in November 2009, which sells Cartier and Jaeger Le Coultre products, and new outlets at Encore at Wynn Macau including Chanel, Piaget and Cartier. Entertainment revenues increased over the prior year primarily due to performances by Garth Brooks in the Encore Theater in Las Vegas which commenced in December 2009, as well as increased revenue from our Le Rêve show.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2,100.1 million, room expenses of $122.3 million, food and beverage expenses of $272.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $204.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $391.3 million and approximately $28.3 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2009, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,460.1 million, room expenses of $111.6 million, food and beverage expenses of $252.7 million, and

 entertainment, retail and other expenses of $166.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $365.1 million and approximately $13.7 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to an increase in casino revenues especially at our Macau Operations where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. Room expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased customer acquisition and marketing costs and the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau in April 2010. Food and beverage expenses increased commensurate with the increase in revenue.  

Entertainment, retail and other expense increased primarily as a result of performances by Garth Brooks in the Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas and increased retail sales in Macau as noted above. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher spending associated with corporate activities. The provision for doubtful accounts receivable increased $14.6 million due to an increase in credit issuances commensurate with the increase in business volume.  

Pre-opening costs  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $9.5 million of pre-opening costs compared to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily related to Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010, and the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub which opened in Las Vegas on May 28, 2010.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $405.6 million compared to $410.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This decrease is primarily due to assets with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of April 2010 at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by depreciation of the assets of Encore at Wynn Macau which were placed in to service in April 2010 and the assets of the Encore Beach Club which were placed in to service in May 2010.  

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at our Macau Operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to our Macau Operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $25.2 million compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010 include a contract termination payment of $14.9 million related to a management contract for certain of the nightclubs at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and gain/loss on sale of equipment at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009, include a $16.7 million charge for the abandonment of the front porte-cochere at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to make way for the Encore Beach Club, the write-off of $6.8 million of aircraft purchase deposits and $5 million related to miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and loss on sale of equipment.

In response to our evaluation of our resorts and the reactions of our guests, we continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010 and 2009, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments include primarily money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and time deposits with a purchase maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $222.9 million, net of capitalized interest of $7.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $211.4 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our interest expense increased approximately $11.5 million primarily due to interest expense for the Wynn Las Vegas $500 million 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes issued in October 2009 and the increased rate on our remaining Wynn Las Vegas First Mortgage Notes as discussed below, offset partially by the payoff of the Wynn Resorts term loan in June 2009 and reduction in amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau bank revolving credit facilities compared to the prior year.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (decrease) in swap fair value in each year. We recorded an expense of approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we recorded an expense of $2.3 million resulting from the decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

In April 2010, we completed an exchange offer for a portion of the Wynn Las Vegas 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Notes). In connection with that exchange offer, the direct costs incurred with third parties of $4.6 million were expensed. Also, in connection with our July 2010 tender offer for the then outstanding 2014 Notes and subsequent call of all the remaining amounts once the tender was completed, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 63.3 million. This included the tender offer consideration, the call premium and the related write off of the unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount.  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18.7 million as a result of several debt retirements. We purchased and retired outstanding loans of $375 million under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan Facility at a discounted price of 97.25%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue cost. During this same period, we purchased $65.8 million face amount of the 2014 Notes through open market purchases at a discount. This transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.7 million, net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs. We participated in the April 2010 tender offer noted above with respect to $35.8 million of these notes and accordingly, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Wynn Resorts holds $30 million of this debt which has not been contributed to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. For accounting purposes these notes were treated as having been extinguished by Wynn Resorts in 2009. In October 2009, we purchased loans through an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement, with a face-value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $2.1 million on early retirement of debt. Offsetting these gains was the write off of debt issue costs of approximately $5.9 million related to permanent reductions in our bank credit facility.  

Income Taxes  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a tax expense of $20.4 million. Our provision for income taxes was primarily comprised of increases in our foreign and domestic valuation allowances relating to foreign tax loss carryforwards, other foreign deferred tax assets and U.S. foreign tax credits not considered more  

46  

Table of Contents 

 likely than not realizable in the future. The tax provision recorded for the valuation allowance increases was reduced by an income tax benefit recorded for the loss from our U.S. operations. As of June 30, 2010, we no longer consider our portion of the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited to be permanently reinvested. No additional U.S. tax provision has been made with respect to this amount as we anticipate that U.S. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any U.S. tax provision relating to such repatriation. Prior to this change, our earnings attributable to periods after September 2009, were considered permanently reinvested abroad. The decrease in our current deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the repatriation of $1.14 billion of Wynn Macau, Limited IPO proceeds not considered permanently reinvested. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized income tax benefits related to excess tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation costs of $10.5 million.  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of $64.4 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau S.A. received an additional 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits to December 31, 2015.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock through an initial public offering. We recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.5 million for the period October 9, 2009, the date of the initial public offering, to December 31, 2009. This represents the noncontrolling interests share of net income from Wynn Macau, Limited.  

Adjusted Property EBITDA  

We use adjusted property EBITDA to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. We use adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors. We also present adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA. Also, our calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

The following table (amounts in thousands) summarizes adjusted property EBITDA for our Las Vegas and Macau Operations as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementNote 17 Segment Information. That footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property EBITDA to net income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2011, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in Las Vegas began to improve with increased levels of gaming revenue, visitation and hotel room demand. While these gaming and hotel statistics have increased from prior year levels, uncertainty still exists in the Las Vegas market. During 2011, the average daily room rate increased 10.7%, visitation increased 4.3% to 38.9 million visitors, and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenues increased 5.1%, all as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2010, the average daily room rate increased 2%, visitation increased 2.7% to 37.3 million visitors, and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenues increased 4.5%, all as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.  

For 2011, our Las Vegas Operations benefited from increased gaming volumes, a higher than normal table games win percentage, improved ADR, and an overall increase in all other revenue streams including food and beverage, entertainment and retail. While we experienced a slight decrease in our occupancy compared to the prior year, we were able to achieve an increase in ADR as we adjusted rates to attract a higher quality customer who would take advantage of all aspects of our resort. While we benefited from higher win percentages on our table games and higher non-casino revenues for the year, the economic environment in the Las Vegas market is still uncertain.  

Our Macau Operations adjusted property EBITDA has increased as the Macau market continues to grow and as a result of our expansion of that resort as detailed in the discussions above regarding our results of operations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flow from Operations  

Our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our Las Vegas and Macau operations (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. Our table games play both in Macau and Las Vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. A portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers that gamble on credit. The ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. Our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. Accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables.  

Net cash provided from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is primarily due to the increase in operating income as a result of increased operating department profitability at both our Las Vegas Operations and our Macau Operations, especially in the casino, room and food and beverage departments. Offsetting this increase was the impact of ordinary working capital changes primarily driven by customer deposits and accounts receivable and an increase in cash paid for interest of $49.5 million.

Capital Resources  

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations, debt service and retirement, development activities, general corporate purposes and enhancements to our resorts. Of this amount $663.5 million was held by Wynn Macau, Limited and its subsidiaries of which we own 72.3%. If repatriated to the U.S., substantially all of our portion of such cash would be subject to U.S. tax in the year of repatriation. Cash balances held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, was $378.5 million. We also have available-for-sale investments in foreign and domestic debt securities with maturities of 1 to 3 years totaling $213.6 million.  

In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $351.1 million of availability under our Wynn Las Vegas Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $849.6 million of availability under our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Debt maturities in 2012 are $407.9 million.  

We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2012. If any additional financing became necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.  

Cash and cash equivalents include investments in money market funds, domestic and foreign bank time deposits and commercial paper, all with maturities of less than 90 days.  

Investing Activities  

Capital expenditures were approximately $184.1 million, $283.8 million and $540.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For 2011, our capital expenditures primarily relate to the room and suite remodel at Wynn Las Vegas, a new high limit slot salon, new Las Vegas Tower Suites lobby and lounge and other property remodels. In addition, 2011 includes a $62.5 million initial payment pursuant to the terms of a draft land concession in Macau. For 2010 and 2009, our capital expenditures relate primarily to the construction cost associated with Encore at Wynn Macau, which opened in April 2010, the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub, which opened in May 2010 and final costs associated with Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened in December 2008.  

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we invested $316.5 million in corporate debt securities and commercial paper.  

Financing Activities  

Las Vegas Operations  

As of December 31, 2011, our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, as amended, consisted of a $108.5 million revolving credit facility, due July 2013 and a $258.4 million revolving credit facility due July 2015 (together the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver), and a fully drawn $40.3 million term loan facility due August 2013 and a fully drawn $330.6 million term loan facility due August 2015 (together the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan). The Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan are together referred to as the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repaid $20.1 million of borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and $4 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan. As of December 31, 2011, the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was fully drawn and we had no borrowings outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We had $15.8 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce availability for borrowing under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. Accordingly, we had availability of $351.1 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver as of December 31, 2011.  

Loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities bear interest at fluctuating rates, based on either LIBOR or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2011, the applicable margin for  

49  

Table of Contents 

 LIBOR loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan due August 17, 2015 was 3.0%, and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan due August 15, 2013 was 1.875%. Base Rate Loans bear interest at (a) the greatest of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum, and (iii) in the case of a Wynn Las Vegas Revolver loan the one month Eurodollar rate; plus (b) a borrowing margin of 2.0% for Wynn Las Vegas Revolver loans and 0.875% for Wynn Las Vegas Term Loans. Interest on Base Rate Loans will be payable quarterly in arrears. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC also pays, quarterly in arrears, 1.0% per annum on the daily average of unused commitments under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver.  

In addition to scheduled amortization payments, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from the net proceeds of all debt offerings (other than those constituting certain permitted debt). Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is also required to make mandatory repayments of indebtedness under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from specified percentages of excess cash flow, which percentages may decrease and/or be eliminated based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio. For 2012, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects to make a mandatory repayment of approximately $88 million in March pursuant to this provision of the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC has the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities contain customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, negative covenants that restrict Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs ability to: incur additional indebtedness, including guarantees; create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on property and assets; declare or pay dividends and make distributions or restrict the ability of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions; engage in mergers, investments and acquisitions; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; execute modifications to material contracts; engage in sales of assets; make capital expenditures; and make optional prepayments of certain indebtedness. The financial covenants include maintaining a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 1.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2011. Management believes that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio remains at 1.00 to 1 through June 2013. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $1 billion of net assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC were restricted from being distributed under the terms of its long-term debt.  

As of December 31, 2011, we had the following first mortgage notes outstanding:  

7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2017  

In October 2009, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (together, the Issuers) issued, in a private offering, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7 7/8% first mortgage notes due November 1, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) at a price of 97.823% of the principal amount. Interest is due on the 2017 Notes on May 1st and November 1st of each year. Commencing November 1, 2013, the 2017 Notes are redeemable at the Issuers option at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on November 1st of each year thereafter to zero on or after November 1, 2015.

The indenture governing the 2017 Notes contains customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, negative covenants that restrict Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets or create dividend and other payment restriction affecting subsidiaries.

The 2020 Notes were issued pursuant to an exchange offer for previously issued notes that were to mature in December 2014. Interest is due on the 2020 Notes on May 1st and November 1st of each year. Commencing May 1, 2015, the 2020 Notes are redeemable at the Issuers option at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on May 1st of each year thereafter to zero on or after May 1, 2018. The 2020 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities and 2017 Notes. The 2020 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by certain of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries and secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors, and a first priority lien on the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities and the 2017 Notes. The indenture governing the 2020 Notes contains customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, negative covenants that restrict Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets or create dividend and other payment restriction affecting subsidiaries.  

7 3/4% First Mortgage Notes due 2020  

In August 2010, the Issuers issued $1.32 billion aggregate principal amount of 7 3/4% first mortgage notes due August 15, 2020 (the New 2020 Notes). The New 2020 Notes were issued at par. The New 2020 Notes refinanced a previous note issue that was to mature in December 2014. Interest is due on the New 2020 Notes on February 15th and August 15th of each year. Commencing August 15, 2015, the New 2020 Notes are redeemable at the Issuers option at a price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on August 15th of each year thereafter to zero on or after August 15, 2018. The New 2020 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes. The New 2020 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by certain of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries and secured on an equal and ratable basis (with certain exceptions) by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors, and a first priority lien on the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes. The indenture governing the New 2020 Notes contains customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, negative covenants that restrict Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs ability to: pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity; incur additional debt; make investments; create liens on assets to secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another company; transfer and sell assets or create dividend and other payment restriction affecting subsidiaries.  

Macau Operations  

As of December 31, 2011, our Wynn Macau credit facilities, as amended, consisted of a $550 million equivalent fully-funded senior term loan facility (the Wynn Macau Term Loan), and a $1 billion equivalent senior revolving credit facility (the Wynn Macau Revolver) in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars. The Wynn Macau Revolver and the Wynn Macau Term Loan are together referred to as the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repaid $100.2 million of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Revolver in the first part of the year and borrowed $150.4 million in December 2011. Beginning in September 2011, quarterly payments became due under the Wynn Macau Term Loan and for 2011 the total amount repaid was $74 million. As of December 31, 2011, the Wynn Macau Term Loan was fully drawn, with total amounts outstanding of $477.3 million and we had $150.4 million in borrowings outstanding under the Wynn Macau Revolver. We had $849.6 million of availability under the Wynn Macau Revolver as of December 31, 2011.

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the Wynn Macau Term Loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments that commenced in September 2011, with $145.9 million due in 2012. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) plus a margin which was 1.75% through September 30, 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on Wynn Macaus leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. At December 31, 2011, the margin was 1.25% to 1.75%.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that we must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If the Wynn Macau subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 4.0 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on current estimates we do not believe that the Wynn Macau Consolidated Leverage Ratio during the year ending December 31, 2012 will exceed 4.0 to 1. Accordingly we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2012.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, Wynn Macau was required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of not greater than 3.50 to 1 as of December 31, 2011, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, of not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that Wynn Macau was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011.  

Wynn Resorts, Limited  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock. We received proceeds, net of related costs, of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of this transaction.  

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid cash dividends totaling $6.50 per share, $8.50 per share and $4.00 per share, respectively.  

Our Board of Directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. No share repurchases were made during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. During 2011, the Company repurchased a total of 51,136 shares (6,160 shares during the fourth quarter) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased a total of 12,856,090 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $15.8 million.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2011 (amounts in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2011. Such rates are at historical lows as of December 31, 2011. Actual rates will vary.  

 [2] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for an aircraft purchase, future charitable contributions, fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 15 Income Taxes, of this report, we had $85.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2011.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau debt instruments significantly restrict our ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing the 2017 Notes, the 2020 Notes and the New 2020 Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indentures. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The Wynn Las Vegas, LLC Credit Facilities contain similar restrictions. While the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contains similar restrictions, Wynn Macau is currently in compliance with all requirements, namely satisfaction of its leverage ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.  

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We cannot assure you; however, that our Las Vegas Operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Macau Revolver. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.  

The Companys articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the Companys or any affiliates application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of Wynn Resorts capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by Wynn Resorts. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.  

On February 18, 2012, the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts determined that Aruze USA, Inc., Universal Entertainment Corporation and Mr. Kazuo Okada are unsuitable under the provisions of Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation and redeemed all of Aruze USA, Inc.s 24,549,222 shares of Wynn Resorts common stock. Pursuant to Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation, Wynn Resorts issued the Redemption Price Promissory Note to Aruze USA, Inc. in redemption of the shares. For additional information on the redemption and the Redemption Price Promissory Note, see Item 8Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19 Subsequent Events.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A summary of our significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self-insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.  

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates  

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.  

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our resorts, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets.  

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.  

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in  

54  

Table of Contents 

 August 2029. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the land concession which currently expires in August 2029, or the gaming concession which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income.  

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  

Investments and Fair Value  

We have made investments in domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We determine the appropriate classification (held-to-maturity/available-for-sale) of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Adjustments are made for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. Such amortization is included in interest income together with realized gains and losses and the stated interest on such securities.  

We measure certain of our financial assets and liabilities, such as cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and interest rate swaps, at fair value on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. These accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

We obtain pricing information in determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities from independent pricing vendors. Based on our inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use. The assumptions and inputs used by the pricing vendors are derived from market observable sources including: reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark curves, bids, offers and other market-related data. We have not made adjustments to such prices. Each quarter, we validate the fair value pricing methodology to determine the fair value consistent with applicable accounting guidance and to confirm that the securities are classified properly in the fair value hierarchy. We also compare the pricing received from our vendors to independent sources for the same or similar securities.

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our Las Vegas Operations. While offered, the issuance of credit at our Macau Operations is less significant when compared to Las Vegas. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.  

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.  

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 85% and 82%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries.  

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply industry standard reserve percentages to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customers financial condition, collection history and any other known information. The standard reserve percentages applied are based on our historical experience and take into consideration current industry and economic conditions.  

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 41.7% and 35.1%, respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.  

At December 31, 2011, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $1.3 million.  

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer  

56  

Table of Contents 

 account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a regions economy or legal system.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. As of December 31, 2011, changes in our interest rate swap fair values are being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.  

We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. We categorize our interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 in the hierarchy as described above. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

Accounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments we issue. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.  

The expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. We estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. For example, a 10% change in the volatility assumption for the 25,200 options granted in 2011 would have resulted in an approximate $117,000 change in fair value. Expected term represents the estimated average time between the options grant date and its exercise date. A 10% change in the expected term assumption for the 25,200 options granted in 2011 would have resulted in an approximate $20,000 change in fair value. These assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.  

Accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).  

Self-Insurance Reserves  

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs of employee health coverage (fully insured for employee health coverage beginning January 1, 2012), workers compensation and general liability claims. Insurance  

57  

Table of Contents 

 claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. In estimating these accruals, we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected level of costs per claim. Management believes the estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon its methodology; however, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities.  

Customer Loyalty Program  

We offer a slot club program whereby customers may earn points based on their level of play that may be redeemed for free credit that must be replayed in the slot machine. We accrue a liability based on the points earned times the redemption value, less an estimate for breakage, and record a related reduction in casino revenue.  

Slot Machine Jackpots  

We do not accrue a liability for base jackpots because we have the ability to avoid payment of such as the slot machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Conversely, when we are unable to avoid payment of the jackpot (i.e., the incremental amount on a progressive machine) due to legal requirements, the jackpot is accrued as the obligation becomes unavoidable. This liability is accrued over the time period in which the incremental progressive jackpot amount is generated with a related reduction in casino revenue.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.  

As of December 31, 2011, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $1,848 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $1,777 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. The U.S. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of net foreign source income. Due to our current operating history of U.S. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the utilization of the foreign tax credits. The estimated future foreign tax credit realization was based upon the estimated future taxable income from the reversal of net U.S. taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. The amount of the valuation allowance is subject to change based upon the actual reversal of temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences.  

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  

Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when  

58  

Table of Contents 

 the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in accounting for income taxes (i.e., likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).  

Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized interest and penalties of approximately $40,000. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.  

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. On November 30, 2010, we received an additional 5-year exemption to December 31, 2015 related to this tax. Accordingly, during 2011 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $82.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued an accounting standards update that is intended to align the principles for fair value measurements and the related disclosure requirements under GAAP and IFRS. From a GAAP perspective, the updates are largely clarifications and certain additional disclosures. The effective date for this update is for years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. This update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  

In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that will require items of net income, items of other comprehensive income (OCI) and total comprehensive income to be presented in one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This will make the presentation of items within OCI more prominent. Companies will no longer be allowed to present OCI in the statement of stockholders equity. The effective date for this update is for years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
