During 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Ignite Holdings, LLC (“Ignite”) and Baby Jogger Holdings, Inc. (“Baby Jogger”) and acquired the assets of bubba brands, inc. (“bubba”). Ignite and bubba are designers and marketers of durable beverage containers under the brands Contigo, Avex® and bubba, and these businesses are included in the Company’s Home Solutions segment. Baby Jogger is a designer and marketer of premium infant and juvenile products focused on activity strollers and related accessories under the Baby Jogger brand and its City Mini® and City Select® sub-brands. Baby Jogger is included in the Company’s Baby & Parenting segment. 

Based on the Company’s strategy to allocate resources to its businesses relative to their growth potential and those with the greater right to win in the marketplace, the Company determined in 2014 that its Endicia® and Culinary electrics and retail businesses do not align with the Company’s long-term growth plans and has initiated plans to sell these businesses. Accordingly, the Company’s Endicia and Culinary electrics and retail businesses were classified as discontinued operations based on the Company’s commitment to sell those businesses, and the results of operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Endicia business was included in the Writing segment, and the Culinary businesses were included in the Home Solutions segment. The Endicia business provides on-line postage solutions. The Culinary electrics business sells kitchen electrics and accessories to retailers, and the retail business sells cookware products and accessories through outlet stores.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Newell Rubbermaid is committed to building consumer-meaningful brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer superior performance and value. In 2014, the Company increased advertising investments in support of its brands by $52.8 million compared to 2013, and the Company intends to continue to leverage its portfolio of leading brands to create a margin structure that allows for further increases in brand investment. 

The Company is executing its Growth Game Plan, which is its strategy to simplify the organization and free up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Company’s brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more profitable company. 

The Growth Game Plan encompasses the following aspects:

Business Model

•A growing brand-led business with a strong home in the United States and global ambition.

•Consumer brands that win at the point of decision through excellence in performance, design and innovation.

•Professional brands that win the loyalty of the chooser by improving the productivity and performance of the user.

•Collaboration with our partners across the total enterprise in a shared commitment to growth and creating value.

•Delivering competitive returns to shareholders through consistent, sustainable and profitable growth.

Where To Play

•Win Bigger — Deploying resources to businesses and regions with higher growth opportunities through investments in innovation and geographic expansion.

•Win Where We Are — Optimizing the performance of businesses and brands in existing markets by investing in innovation to increase market share and reducing structural spend within the existing geographic footprint.

•Incubate For Growth — Investing in businesses that have unique opportunities for growth, with a primary focus on businesses that are in the early stages of the business cycle.

5 Ways To Win

•Make Our Brands Really Matter — Sharpening brand strategies on the highest impact growth levers and partnering to win with customers and suppliers.

•Build An Execution Powerhouse — Realigning the customer development organization and developing joint business plans for new channel penetration and broader distribution.

•Unlock Trapped Capacity For Growth — Delivering savings from ongoing restructuring projects, working capital reductions and simplification of business processes.

•Develop The Team For Growth — Driving a performance culture aligned to the business strategy and building a more global perspective and talent base.

•Extend Beyond Our Borders — Accelerating investments and growth in emerging markets.

The Company’s transformation efforts in driving the Growth Game Plan into action began in late 2011 and are being implemented over a multi-year period in three phases, which are outlined below. 

•Delivery Phase — Execution during this phase includes implementing structural changes in the organization while ensuring consistent execution and delivery.

•Strategic Phase — Continued consistent execution and delivery while simultaneously shaping the future through increased brand investment and bringing capabilities to speed in order to propel the Growth Game Plan into action.

•Acceleration Phase — Expanded investments behind Win Bigger businesses to drive increased sales and margin expansion which creates additional resources for further brand investment, while also remaining focused on consistent execution and delivery.

During 2014, the Company executed against the Strategic Phase of the Growth Game Plan, investing in core activity systems critical to the Company’s success, unlocking trapped capacity for growth through Project Renewal, investing in new capabilities and the Company’s brands for accelerated growth, and beginning to leverage an operating company structure to release the full potential of the business. The Company expects to continue to implement the Strategic Phase of the Growth Game Plan in 2015.

The Company will continue implementing changes to drive the Growth Game Plan strategy into action. These changes are the foundation of Project Renewal and are organized into the following five workstreams:

•Organizational Simplification: The Company has de-layered its top structure and further consolidated its businesses from nine global business units (“GBUs”) to five business segments.

•EMEA Simplification: The Company is focusing its resources on fewer products and countries, while simplifying go-to-market, delivery and back office support structures.

•Best Cost Finance: The Company is delivering a simplified approach to decision support, transaction processing and information management by leveraging SAP and the streamlined business segments to align resources with the Growth Game Plan. 

•Best Cost Back Office: The Company is driving “One Newell Rubbermaid” efficiencies in customer and consumer services and sourcing functions. 

•Supply Chain Footprint: The Company is further optimizing manufacturing and distribution facilities across its global supply chain. 

In October 2014, the Company announced an expansion of Project Renewal focused on the Organizational Simplification and Supply Chain workstreams. The expansion of Project Renewal is designed to release costs in the areas of procurement, manufacturing and distribution, and through further overhead reduction. The expansion of Project Renewal is intended to focus on significantly reducing complexity in the business and simplifying the Company’s approach to bringing products and programs to market. Project Renewal is expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2017. 

In implementing its strategy and its change agenda, the Company is focused on Every Day Great Execution, or EDGE, to capitalize on and maximize the benefits of investment and growth opportunities and to optimize the cost structure of the business.

For more detailed segment information, including operating income and identifiable assets by segment, refer to Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER INFORMATION

Multi-Product Offering

The Company’s broad product offering in multiple categories permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers. With families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new products, the Company can assist volume purchasers in selling a more profitable product mix. As a potential single source for an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income, and encourage impulse buying by retail consumers.

Foreign Operations

Information regarding the Company’s 2014, 2013 and 2012 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. Information regarding risks relating to the Company’s foreign operations is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.

Please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company’s Venezuela operations. 

Raw Materials and Sourced Finished Goods

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. The Company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin, corrugate and metals, including steel, stainless steel, aluminum and gold. The Company’s resin purchases principally comprise polyethylene, polypropylene and copolyester. Over the long-term, the Company has experienced inflation in raw material prices, labor and sourced products, and the Company expects continued inflation pressures in 2015. On an annualized basis, resin and metals consumed as raw materials generally represent 10% to 15% of annual cost of products sold, with neither resin nor metals individually representing more than 10% of cost of products sold.

The Company also relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. Historically, the Company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs. For a limited number of product lines, a single manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line. In particular, certain businesses within the Baby & Parenting and Home Solutions segments rely on third-party manufacturers 

 7
for substantially all of their products. Specifically, the Company’s Baby & Parenting segment has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of Baby & Parenting’s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.

Backlog

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

Seasonal Variations

Sales of the Company’s products tend to be seasonal, with sales and operating income in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter. Historically, the Company has earned approximately 60% of its annual operating income during the second and third quarters of the year. The seasonality of the Company’s sales volume, combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation, amortization, rent, personnel costs and interest expense, impacts the Company’s results on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company has historically generated more than 90% of its operating cash flow in the second half of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments and customer rebates, and credit terms provided to customers.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to its business. The Company’s most significant registered trademarks are “Sharpie®,” “Paper Mate®,” “Parker®,” “Waterman®,” “Dymo®,” “Rubbermaid®,” “Contigo®,” “Levolor®,” “Goody®,” “Calphalon®,” “Irwin®,” “Lenox®,” “Graco®,” “Baby Jogger®” and “Aprica®.”

Customers/Competition

The Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers, together with consumer shopping patterns, contributes to a market environment in which dominant multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers. This environment may limit the Company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices.

Current trends among retailers and e-commerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong end-user brands, are for retailers and e-commerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label brands, which compete with products of the Company. The combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well-established.

The Company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining consumer-meaningful brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance; delivering superior customer service and consistent on-time delivery; producing and procuring products at a competitive cost; and experienced management. In addition, the Company focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that meet consumers’ needs. 

The Company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume retailers, including discount, drug, grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; department, hardware and specialty stores; home centers; office superstores; contract stationers; and e-commerce companies. The Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart (which includes Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately 10.6% of net sales in 2014, across substantially all segments. The Company’s top-ten customers in 2014 included (in alphabetical order): Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Lowe’s, Office Depot, Staples, Target, The Home Depot, Toys ‘R’ Us, United Stationers and Wal-Mart.

The Company continues to invest to strengthen its product design and research and development capabilities and has consolidated its design and innovation capabilities into a center of excellence. The Company’s enhanced marketing and insight and research and development capabilities have been leveraged to implement a new ideation process throughout the business, resulting in idea fragments that feed the development of product concepts.
