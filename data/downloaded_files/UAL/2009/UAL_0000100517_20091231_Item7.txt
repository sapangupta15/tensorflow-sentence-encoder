ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview  

This Annual Report on Form 10-K is a combined report of UAL and United including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. Uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UALs revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UALs assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. Therefore, the following qualitative discussion is applicable to both UAL and United, unless otherwise noted. Any significant differences between UAL and United results are separately disclosed and explained. United meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K and is therefore filing this Form 10-K with the reduced disclosure format allowed under that general instruction.

As discussed above under Item 1, Business, the Company derives virtually all of its revenues from airline related activities. The most significant source of airline revenues is passenger revenues; however, Mileage Plus, United Cargo and United Services are also major sources of operating revenues. The airline industry is highly competitive and is characterized by intense price competition. Fare discounting by Uniteds competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Companys financial results because United has generally been required to match competitors fares to maintain passenger traffic. Future competitive fare adjustments may negatively impact the Companys future financial results. One of the Companys most significant operating expenses is jet fuel. Jet fuel prices are extremely volatile and are largely uncontrollable by the Company. The Companys historical and future earnings have been, and will continue to be, significantly impacted by jet fuel prices.  

The Company continues to implement its Focus on Five business approach, a comprehensive set of priorities that focuses on the fundamentals of running a good airline: one that runs on time, with clean planes and courteous employees, delivers industry-leading revenues and competitive costs, and does so safely. The goal of this approach is to enable United to achieve best-in-class safety performance, exceptional customer satisfaction and experience, and industry-leading margin and cash flow. During 2009, Uniteds positions with respect to certain key metrics reported by the DOT improved significantly. In addition to improvements in overall customer satisfaction scores, United ranked number one in on-time performance for domestic scheduled flights for 2009 among the five largest global U.S. based carriers, as measured by the DOT and as published in the Air Travel Consumer Report for 2009. The Company also reduced unit costs through cost control initiatives and successfully completed a number of financing initiatives during 2009 to strengthen its liquidity and considerably reduce its near-term scheduled debt payments.  

Recent Developments. The global recession created an extremely challenging environment for the Company. For most of 2008 and 2009, the airline industry experienced decreased demand for air travel which put pressure on the Companys operating cash reserves, as well as its operating revenues. Despite challenging revenue conditions, the Company significantly reduced its year-over-year operating expenses. In addition to fuel price declines and reduced capacity, the Companys commitment to cost reduction was a contributing factor to this reduction in operating expenses, as presented in the table below. The following table presents the unit cost of various components of total operating expenses and related year-over-year changes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Amounts are summarized in the Summary Results of Operations table in Financial Results, below.  

In addition, to mitigate the negative impact of the global recession, the Company focused on implementing strategies during 2009 related to, among other things, capacity reductions, fleet optimization, revenue generation and airline alliances as discussed below.  

Some of these actions include the following:  

       The Company reduced its Mainline domestic and international capacity by 5% and 8%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to the prior year. Mainline domestic capacity decreased 10% while international capacity decreased 9% for the full year of 2009, as compared to 2008.  

36  

Table of Contents 

 Consolidated capacity was approximately 3% and 7% lower in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2009, respectively, as compared to the prior year;  

       The Company permanently removed 100 aircraft from its fleet, including its entire fleet of 94 B737 aircraft and six B747 aircraft in order to eliminate unprofitable capacity and divest the Company of assets that did not provide an acceptable return. The Company also streamlined its operations and corporate functions in order to match the size of its workforce to the size of its reduced capacity, resulting in a workforce reduction of approximately 9,000 positions during 2008 and 2009. The workforce reduction was completed through a combination of furloughs and furlough-mitigation programs, such as voluntary early-out options, to reduce the required involuntary furloughs. Of the total represented workforce reduction, approximately 45% was accomplished through voluntary furloughs;  

       The Company reconfigured its entire Ted fleet of 56 all-economy Airbus aircraft to include United First, Economy Plus and economy seating and continues to refit its widebody international aircraft with new first and business class premium seats, entertainment systems and other product enhancements. During 2009, the Company completed its upgrade of all of its B767 and B747 aircraft, which are used for international flights, and commenced the reconfiguration of its international B777 fleet in February 2010;  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       In October 2009, Continental joined United and its 24 partners in the Star Alliance linking the airlines networks and services worldwide and creating new revenue opportunities, cost savings and other efficiencies;  

       In December 2009, United filed an application jointly with All Nippon Airways and Continental to the DOT for antitrust immunity for a series of alliance agreements between and among the carriers, including a transpacific joint venture agreement; and  

       In December 2009, the Company announced its intention to place an aircraft order for 25 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft and 25 Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, with future purchase rights for an additional 50 planes of each aircraft type. The 25 Boeing aircraft and 25 Airbus aircraft are to replace the Companys international Boeing 747s and 767s. The Company estimates that it will reduce its fuel costs and carbon emissions from the 25 Boeing aircraft and 25 Airbus aircraft combined by approximately 33% compared with the aircraft they will replace, lower average lifetime maintenance costs for the 25 Boeing aircraft and 25 Airbus aircraft combined by approximately 40% per available seat mile compared with the aircraft they will replace, and enable service to a broader range of international destinations while providing customers with state-of-the-art cabin comfort. The Boeing aircraft order is pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into by the Company and The Boeing Company in February 2010 and the Airbus aircraft order is subject to the execution of a definitive written agreement that is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2010.  

The Company also took certain actions to enhance its liquidity and minimize its financing costs during this challenging economic environment. In 2009, the Companys liquidity initiatives generated unrestricted cash of more than $1.5 billion primarily from the issuance of UAL common stock, proceeds from new debt issuances and aircraft asset sale-leaseback transactions. See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancing Activities, below, for additional information related to these transactions.  

The Company also made the following significant changes to its international route network:  

       The Company commenced new daily service from Washington Dulles to Moscow and Geneva in March and April 2009, respectively;  

37  

Table of Contents 

       The Company will commence its first-ever service to Africa, with one daily, same-plane service from Washington Dulles to Accra, Ghana during the second quarter of 2010. In addition, United plans to add service to Lagos, Nigeria, pending government approvals;  

       The Company will offer a new non-stop flight between OHare and Brussels, Belgium and will extend its existing daily Washington Dulles-Kuwait flight to include a direct flight to Bahrain, starting in March and April 2010, respectively; and  

       The Company entered into a joint venture to offer service from Washington Dulles to Madrid beginning March 2010.  

Financial Results. The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the Companys revenues are better in the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarters of each year, since its first and fourth quarter results normally reflect weaker travel demand. In addition, the Companys results of operations may be impacted by adverse weather, air traffic control delays, fuel price volatility and other factors in any period.  

The table below presents certain financial statement items to provide an overview of the Companys financial performance for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The most significant contributors to the Companys net losses in 2009 and 2008 were the negative impact of the economic recession on revenues in 2009 and increased fuel prices and asset impairments in 2008. The table below also highlights that the Company, through its past and on-going cost reduction initiatives, was able to effectively manage costs in non-fuel and other areas, although the benefits of these cost savings initiatives were not sufficient to offset, in 2009, lower revenues due to the global recession, and, in 2008, the dramatic increase in fuel cost.

Liquidity. The following table provides a summary of the Companys total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2009 and 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in the Companys cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances was primarily due to a $2.2 billion improvement in cash flows from operations in 2009, as compared to 2008, and the significant liquidity initiatives described in Recent Developments, above. UALs variation in cash flows from operations in the 2009 period, as compared to the prior year, was relatively consistent with its results of operations as further described below under Results of Operations. Lower cash expenditures for fuel purchases were offset by lower cash receipts from the sale of passenger and cargo transportation in 2009, as compared to 2008. In 2009, the Company received $160 million related to the future relocation of its OHare cargo operations. This cash receipt was classified as an operating cash inflow. The Company also received $35 million from LAX as part of an agreement to vacate certain facilities. Decreases in the Companys fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately $955 million. This benefit was substantially offset by approximately $730 million of net cash paid to counterparties for fuel derivative contract settlements and premiums during 2009.  

The Company expects its cash flows from operations and its available capital to be sufficient to meet its future operating expenses, lease obligations and debt service requirements in the next twelve months; however, the Companys future liquidity could be impacted by increases or decreases in fuel prices, fuel hedge collateral requirements, inability to adequately increase revenues to offset high fuel prices, softening revenues resulting from reduced demand, failure to meet future debt covenants and other factors. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, below, for a discussion of these factors and the Companys significant operating, investing and financing cash flows.  

Capital Commitments. The Companys capital purchase commitments of $622 million are for the purchase of property and equipment, including commitments related to its international premium cabin enhancement program. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had remaining capital commitments to complete international enhancements on 46 aircraft. In addition, the Company has an option to purchase 42 A319 and A320 aircraft for $2.3 billion.  

Contingencies. United has guaranteed $270 million of the City and County of Denver, Colorado Special Facilities Airport Revenue Bonds (United Air Lines Project) Series 2007A (the Denver Bonds). This guarantee replaces our prior guarantee of $261 million of bonds issued by the City and County of Denver, Colorado in 1992. These bonds are callable by United. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the Companys Financial Statements. However, the related lease agreement is accounted for on a straight-line basis resulting in a ratable accrual of the final $270 million payment over the lease term.   

Bankruptcy Matters. On December 9, 2002, UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize its business under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company emerged from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, under the Plan of Reorganization that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court. During the course of its Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached settlements with most of its creditors and resolved all claims pending in the bankruptcy case. On December 8, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree closing all bankruptcy cases against the Company, effective as of that date. See Note 13, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties, in the Footnotes for further information regarding bankruptcy matters.  

Legal and Environmental. The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering a number of factors,  

40  

Table of Contents 

 including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. When appropriate, the Company accrues for these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of their eventual disposition. The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims.  

The Company anticipates that if ultimately found liable, its damages from claims arising from the events of September 11, 2001, could be significant; however, the Company believes that, under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001, its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage.  

The Company continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result from air cargo/passenger surcharge cartel investigations following the receipt of a Statement of Objections that the Commission issued to 26 companies on December 18, 2007. The Statement of Objections sets out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the Commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal price-fixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry. United has provided written and oral responses vigorously disputing the Commissions allegations against the Company. Nevertheless, United will continue to cooperate with the Commissions ongoing investigation. Based on its evaluation of all information currently available, the Company has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities. However, penalties for violation of European competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the Company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

Many aspects of Uniteds operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments, such as in regard to climate change in the U.S. and abroad, could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. Some climate change laws and regulations that have gone into effect apply to United, including environmental taxes for certain international flights (including the United Kingdoms Air Passenger Duty), limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and land-based planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances. Other areas of developing regulations include the State of California rule-makings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and federal rule-makings concerning the discharge of deicing fluid and the regulation of aircraft drinking water supplies. In addition, a 2009 EU Directive required EU member countries to enact legislation that would include aviation within the EUs existing carbon emissions trading scheme, effective in 2012. The legality of applying such a scheme to non-EU airlines has been widely questioned. In December 2009, the Air Transportation Association, joined by United, Continental and American Airlines, filed a lawsuit in the United Kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into UK law the EU emissions trading scheme as applied to U.S. carriers. In addition, non-EU countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization with respect to the EUs inclusion of non-EU carriers. It is not clear whether the emissions trading scheme will withstand such challenges. If the scheme is found to be valid, however, it could significantly increase the costs of carriers operating in the EU (by requiring the purchase of carbon credits), although the precise cost to United is difficult to calculate with any certainty due to a number of variables, and will depend, among other things, on Uniteds carbon emissions from flights to and from the EU and the price of carbon credits. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the U.S., foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to United are difficult to predict, but the impact to the Company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.  

See Note 13, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties, in the Footnotes for further discussion of the above contingencies.

Operating Revenues.  

2009 compared to 2008  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in UAL and United operating revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents UAL and United passenger revenues and selected operating data from our Mainline segment, broken out by geographic region, and from our Regional Affiliates segment, expressed as year-over-year changes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Yields for geographic regions exclude charter revenue, industry reduced fares, and passenger charges, and related RPMs.  

Consistent with the rest of the airline industry, the Companys decline in PRASM was driven by a precipitous decline in worldwide travel demand as a result of the severe global recession. Two factors had a distinct impact on Uniteds revenue during 2009.  

First, network composition played a role in overall unit revenue decline. International markets, in particular the Pacific region, experienced more significant unit revenue declines as compared to the other regions. Given Uniteds strong international network and its historic relative contribution to revenues, the Companys revenues were disproportionately impacted by the contraction in travel demand in the Pacific.  

Second, while demand declined across all geographic regions, premium and business demand declined more significantly than leisure demand. As Uniteds business model is strongly aligned to serve premium and business travelers, both internationally and domestically, the decrease in travel by business travelers and the buy-down from premium class to economy class by some business travelers caused a significant negative impact on our results of operations. However, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company began to see signs of improvement, as discussed below.  

42  

Table of Contents 

In light of the current poor economic environment, these two factorsnetwork composition and decline of premium and business demandhave had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our results of operations.  

In 2009, revenues for both Mainline and Regional Affiliates were negatively impacted by yield decreases of 15% and 13%, respectively, as compared to 2008. The yield decreases were a result of the weak economic environment in 2009 and the economic factors discussed above. Mainline revenues were also negatively impacted by lower RPMs, which were largely driven by the Companys capacity reductions and by the severe global recession. Partially offsetting Regional Affiliates decrease in yield was a 13% increase in RPMs, driven by an 11% increase in capacity. Regional Affiliates capacity increased as we adjusted the size of our aircraft and capacity across Uniteds total network to conform to market demand and fulfill prior contractual commitments.  

Although the impact of the global recession on the Companys international network, as well as business and premium travel, during late 2008 and 2009 was severe, the Company saw indicators of economic recovery during the fourth quarter of 2009, which accelerated as the quarter progressed. While fourth quarter 2009 consolidated passenger unit revenues were down 5.2% year-over-year, this performance was a vast improvement from the double digit declines in prior quarters. Most importantly, there was a much needed sequential progress during the quarter, ending with modest growth in December. Signs of recovery were evident internationally, as well as in premium cabin booking and corporate revenues.  

In 2009, Mainline and Regional Affiliate revenues benefited from an increase in ancillary revenues, which includes bag fees and other unbundled services, of approximately $141 million, compared to 2008. For the full year of 2009, ancillary revenues totaled approximately $1.1 billion.  

Mainline and Regional Affiliate revenues were favorably impacted in 2009 by an adjustment of approximately $36 million related to certain tax accruals that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenue. This adjustment was recorded as a result of new information received by the Company related to these tax matters.  

Cargo revenues declined by $318 million, or 37%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to four key factors. First, United took significant steps to rationalize its capacity, with reduced international capacity affecting a number of key cargo markets. Second, as noted by industry statistical releases during 2009, virtually all carriers in the industry, including United, were sharply impacted by reduced air freight and mail volumes driven by lower recessionary demand, with the resulting oversupply of cargo capacity putting pressure on industry pricing in nearly all markets. Some of the largest industry demand reductions occurred in the Pacific cargo market, where United has a greater cargo capacity as compared to the Atlantic, Latin and Domestic air cargo markets. Third, lower fuel costs in 2009 also reduced cargo revenues through lower fuel surcharges on cargo shipments as compared to 2008 when historically high fuel prices occurred. Finally United, historically one of the largest carriers of U.S. international mail, was impacted by lower mail volumes and pricing beginning in third quarter of 2009 arising from U.S. international mail deregulation. The deregulation moved pricing from regulated rates set by the DOT to market-based pricing as a result of a competitive bidding process. Towards the end of 2009, the Company began to experience significant market stabilization and improvement in cargo industry demand and yields.

2008 compared to 2007  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in UAL and United operating revenues.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2007 special item of $45 million relates to an adjustment of the estimated obligation associated with certain bankruptcy administrative claims, of which $37 million and $8 million relates to the Mainline and Regional Affiliates segments, respectively. The table below presents selected UAL and United passenger revenues and selected operating data from our Mainline segment, broken out by geographic region with an associated allocation of the special revenue item, and from our Regional Affiliates segment, expressed as year-over-year changes.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Yields for geographic regions exclude charter revenue, industry reduced fares, and passenger charges, and related RPMs.  

In 2008, revenues for both Mainline and Regional Affiliates benefited from yield increases of 7% and 5%, respectively, as compared to 2007. The yield increases are due to industry capacity reductions and fare increases, including fuel surcharges plus incremental revenues derived from ancillary revenue, such as checked bag services. However, the benefit of higher yields was partially offset by 6% and 4% decreases in traffic for the Mainline and Regional Affiliates segments, respectively. Consolidated passenger revenues in 2008 included an unfavorable variance compared to 2007 that was partly due to the change in the Mileage Plus expiration policy for inactive accounts from 36 months to 18 months that provided a consolidated estimated annual benefit of $246 million in 2007. In addition, the weak economic environment negatively impacted demand and passenger revenues, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

International PRASM was up 2% year-over-year with a related capacity increase of 1%. While Latin American PRASM growth was strong at 9% year-over-year, it is not a significant part of Uniteds international network. Atlantic performance was driven by lower than average revenue growth in our London and Germany markets, largely due to industry capacity growth of approximately 13% in the U.S. to London Heathrow route  

44  

Table of Contents 

 and Uniteds 15% growth in Germany. These markets account for approximately 75% of our Atlantic capacity. The Pacific region was impacted by 7% industry capacity growth between the U.S. and China/Hong Kong, which account for approximately 45% of Uniteds Pacific capacity.  

Cargo revenues increased by $84 million, or 11%, in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and improved fleet utilization. In addition, revenues were higher due to increased volume associated with the U.S. domestic mail contract, which commenced in late April 2007, as well as filling new capacity in international markets. A weaker dollar also benefited cargo revenues in 2008 as a significant portion of cargo services are contracted in foreign currencies. However, the Company experienced a significant decline in cargo revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to rationalization of international capacity, falling demand for domestic and international air cargo as the global economy softened, and lower fuel costs driving lower fuel surcharges. Decreased cargo revenues resulting from lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results because cargo revenues typically generate higher margins as compared to passenger revenues.  

Other revenues decreased approximately 11% in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower jet fuel sales to third parties. The decrease in third party fuel sales had a negligible impact on our operating margin because the associated cost of sales decreased by a similar amount in 2008 as compared to 2007.  

Operating Expenses.  

2009 compared to 2008  

As discussed in Operating Revenues, above, the Company (decreased) increased Mainline and Regional Affiliates capacity by (10%) and 11%, respectively, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The Mainline capacity reductions had a significantly favorable impact on certain of the Companys Mainline operating expenses, as further described below. Other significant fluctuations in the Companys operating expenses are also discussed below. The table below includes data related to UAL and United operating expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related costs decreased $538 million, or 13%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the Companys reduced workforce in 2009 compared to 2008. The Company had approximately 43,700 average full-time equivalent employees for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 49,600 in the prior year. A $73 million decrease in severance expense related to the Companys operational plans and a $92 million year-over-year benefit due to changes in employee benefits expenses also contributed to the decrease  

45  

Table of Contents 

 in Salaries and related costs. Salaries and related costs also decreased by $46 million due to the Companys Success Sharing Program. The Company did not record any expense for this plan in 2009. Partially offsetting these benefits were the impacts of average wage and benefit cost increases and a $38 million increase related to on-time performance bonuses paid to operations employee groups during 2009, which were not paid in 2008.  

The decrease in jet fuel expense and Regional Affiliates expense was primarily attributable to decreased market prices for jet fuel, as shown in the table below which presents the significant changes in Mainline and Regional Affiliate jet fuel cost per gallon in 2009 as compared to 2008. Lower Mainline fuel consumption due to the capacity reductions also benefited Mainline fuel expense in 2009 as compared to the prior year. See Note 12, Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments, in the Footnotes for additional details regarding gains/losses from settled positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the period. Derivative gains/losses are not allocated to Regional Affiliate fuel expense.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Regional Affiliates fuel costs are classified as part of Regional Affiliates expense.  

NM Not meaningful.  

Regional Affiliates expense decreased $309 million, or 10%, during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a $458 million decrease in Regional Affiliates fuel cost. The decrease in Regional Affiliates fuel cost was primarily due to a lower average price per gallon of Regional Affiliates jet fuel in 2009, as presented in the table above, and was partially offset by increased fuel consumption as a result of the increase in Regional Affiliates capacity. Increased capacity agreement payments to Regional Affiliates as a result of increased capacity, partially offset the net fuel benefit. The Regional Affiliates operating income was $125 million in the 2009 period, as compared to a loss of $150 million in the 2008 period. Regional Affiliates operating results improved significantly on a year-over-year basis as the benefits of increased traffic and lower fuel cost offset the yield decrease.  

Purchased services decreased $208 million, or 15%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the Companys operating cost savings programs and lower variable costs associated with lower Mainline capacity.  

During 2009, aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased by $131 million, or 12%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower volume of engine and airframe maintenance expense as a result of the Companys early retirement of 100 aircraft from its operating fleet and the timing of maintenance on other fleet types.  

46  

Table of Contents 

Landing fees and other rent increased $43 million, or 5%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to higher rates.  

Distribution expenses decreased $176 million, or 25%, in 2009 primarily due to lower passenger revenues on lower traffic and yields driving reductions in commissions, credit card fees and GDS fees as compared to 2008. The Company has also implemented several operating cost savings programs for both commissions and GDS fees which produced realized savings in the current year.  

Aircraft rent expense decreased by $63 million, or 15%, primarily as a result of the Companys operational plans to retire its entire fleet of B737 aircraft, some of which were financed through operating leases.  

Cost of third party sales decreased by $42 million, or 15%, primarily due to reduced sales of engine maintenance services.  

Asset Impairments and Special Items.  

In 2009, the Company recorded special charges of $27 million related to the final settlement of the LAX municipal bond litigation, $104 million primarily related to B737 aircraft lease terminations and $93 million related to the impairment of regional aircraft and nonoperating B737 and B747 aircraft. In addition, the Company recorded a $150 million intangible asset impairment to decrease the value of United tradenames. A significant factor resulting in the lower fair value of the tradenames was a decrease in estimated future revenues due to the weak economic environment and the Companys capacity reductions, among other factors. In 2008, the Company incurred asset impairment charges of $2.6 billion, as shown in the table below. All special charges and impairments relate to the Mainline segment and the non-goodwill impairment charges are classified within Other impairments and special items in the Companys Financial Statements. See Note 3, Asset Impairments and Intangible Assets and Note 12, Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments, and in the Footnotes for additional information.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2009, other operating expenses decreased by $123 million, or 11%, as compared to 2008 due to the Companys cost savings initiatives and lower variable expenses due to reduced capacity in the 2009 period as compared to 2008. UAL recorded a gain of $29 million for a litigation settlement resulting in a reduction of other operating expenses during 2008.

2008 compared to 2007  

The table below includes data related to UAL and United operating expenses. Significant fluctuations are discussed below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in aircraft fuel expense and Regional Affiliates expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for crude oil and related fuel products as shown in table below, which presents several key variances for Mainline and Regional Affiliate aircraft fuel expense in 2008 as compared to 2007.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Regional Affiliates fuel costs are classified as part of Regional Affiliates expense.  

Salaries and related costs increased $50 million in 2008. The Companys costs in 2008 include increases in average wages and benefits expense, as well as severance expense of $106 million due to the implementation of

 the Companys operating plans, as more fully described in Note 2, Company Operational Plans, in the Footnotes. In addition, the Company recorded $87 million of expense in 2008 from certain benefit obligation adjustments, which were primarily due to discount rate changes. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower combined profit and success sharing expense in the 2008 period as compared to the year-ago period due to the unfavorable financial results in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, 2008 salaries and related costs benefited from the workforce reductions completed during the year.  

Regional Affiliates expense increased $307 million, or 10%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. Regional Affiliates expense increased primarily due to a $342 million, or 37%, increase in Regional Affiliates fuel that was driven by an increase in market price for fuel as highlighted in the fuel table above. The Regional Affiliates operating loss was $150 million in 2008 period, as compared to income of $122 million in 2007, due to the aforementioned fuel impacts, which could not be fully offset by higher ticket prices, as Regional Affiliates revenues were only 1% higher in 2008.  

The Companys purchased services increased $29 million, or 2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. In 2008, purchased services included a charge of $26 million related to certain projects and transactions being terminated or indefinitely postponed. In 2008, other areas of purchased services did not change significantly as compared to 2007.  

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 6% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in engine and airframe maintenance associated with the retirement of the Companys B737 fleet and more favorable engine maintenance contract rates.  

Depreciation expense in 2008 was adversely impacted by $34 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the retirement of certain B737 and B747 aircraft and related parts and a $20 million charge to increase the inventory obsolescence reserve. This adverse impact was partially offset by reduced amortization expense in 2008 related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2007.  

UAL landing fees and other rent decreased 2% in 2008 due to a reduction in the amount of facilities rented associated with ongoing efforts to optimize our rented facilities consistent with our operational needs.  

Distribution expenses decreased 9% in 2008 as compared to 2007 largely due to the Companys reduction of some of its travel agency commission programs in 2008, resulting in an average commission rate reduction. In addition, the Companys lower passenger revenues, due to its capacity reductions in 2008, contributed to the decrease in related distribution expenses.  

Cost of third party sales decreased 14% year-over-year primarily due to a reduction in the cost of jet fuel sales as a result of a reduction in sales to third parties.  

Other operating expenses decreased 5% in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was partly due to a $29 million litigation-settlement gain, which was recorded in other operating expenses, and decreases in several other expense categories which resulted from the Companys cost reduction program.  

Asset Impairments and Special Items.  

As described in the Footnotes, as of May 31, 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill, all intangible assets and certain of its long-lived assets (principally aircraft pre-delivery deposits, aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts) due to events and changes in circumstances during the first five months of 2008 that indicated an impairment might have occurred. In addition, the Company also performed an impairment test of certain aircraft fleet types as of December 31, 2008, because unfavorable market conditions for aircraft indicated potential impairment of value. The Company also performed annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing at October 1, 2008. As a result of all of its 2008 impairment testing, the  

49  

Table of Contents 

 Company recorded asset impairment charges of $2.6 billion as presented in the table above under 2009 compared to 2008. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 3, Asset Impairments and Intangible Assets, in the Footnotes for additional information, including factors considered by management in concluding that triggering events, which indicated potential impairment, had occurred and additional details of assets impaired.  

In addition, lease termination and other charges of $25 million were recorded during 2008 which primarily relate to the accrual of future rents for the B737 leased aircraft that were removed from service and charges associated with the return of certain of these aircraft to their lessors.  

The Company recorded special operating expense credits of $44 million in 2007. These items have been classified as special because they are directly related to the resolution of bankruptcy administrative claims and are not indicative of the Companys ongoing financial performance. Special items in the year ended December 31, 2007 included a $30 million benefit due to the reduction in recorded accruals for bankruptcy litigation related to our SFO and LAX municipal bond obligations and a $14 million benefit due to the Companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain other bankruptcy pre-confirmation contingencies. The 2007 special items resulted from revised estimates of the probable amount to be settled by the Bankruptcy Court. See Note 13, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties and Note 18, Special Items, in the Footnotes for further information on these special items and bankruptcy matters.  

Other Income (Expense).   

2009 compared to 2008  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UAL and United other income (expense).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

UAL interest expense increased $6 million, or 1%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to increased borrowing, partially offset by lower interest rates on the Companys variable-rate borrowings. The decrease in interest expense was more than offset by a $93 million decrease in interest income primarily due to reduced investment yields resulting from lower market rates.  

The hedge losses included in Miscellaneous, net in the 2008 period were due to significant fuel price declines below the contractual prices in the Companys fuel hedge portfolio that existed during and at the end of 2008. The Companys fuel derivative gain in 2009 was less significant because the Company did not have any significant derivative activity for hedges that are classified in Miscellaneous, net, in 2009, other than settlement of contracts that existed at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no unsettled fuel derivative trades that are classified within Miscellaneous, net. See Note 12, Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments, in the Footnotes for further information related to fuel hedges.

2008 compared to 2007  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UAL and United other income (expense).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

UAL interest expense decreased $133 million, or 19%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2008 period was favorably impacted by $1.5 billion of total credit facility prepayments and the February 2007 credit facility amendment, which lowered Uniteds interest rate on these obligations. Scheduled debt obligation repayments throughout 2008 and 2007 also reduced interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007. Lower benchmark interest rates on the Companys variable-rate borrowings also reduced the Companys interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007. Interest expense in 2007 included the write-off of $17 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the February 2007 Amended Credit Facility partial prepayment, $6 million of financing costs associated with the February 2007 amendment and a gain of $22 million from a debt extinguishment. The benefit of lower interest expense in 2008 was offset by a $145 million decrease in interest income due to lower average cash and short-term investment balances and lower investment yields. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 includes $48 million and $43 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense related to the Companys retrospective adoption of new accounting principles related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below, for further details related to financing activities.  

Nonoperating fuel hedge gains/losses relate to hedging instruments that are not classified as economic hedges. These net hedge gains/losses are presented separately in the table above for purposes of additional analysis. These hedging gains/losses are due to favorable/unfavorable movements in crude oil prices relative to the fuel hedge instrument terms. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 12, Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments, in the Footnotes for further discussion of these hedges.  

There were no significant investment gains or losses in 2008 as compared to 2007 during which the Company recorded a $41 million gain on sale of an investment. This gain resulted from the Companys sale of its 21.1% interest in Aeronautical Radio, Inc. during 2007.  

The $24 million variance in Miscellaneous, net is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2008.  

Income Taxes.  

In 2009, UAL and United recorded a tax benefit of $17 million and $16 million, respectively, primarily due to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, partially offset by income tax effects of items recorded in  

51  

Table of Contents 

 other comprehensive income. The tax benefit recorded in 2008 is related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates. UAL recorded income tax expense of $297 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 (an effective tax rate of 45.5%). See Note 7, Income Taxes, in the Footnotes for additional information.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months, including liquidity for scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations, capital expenditures, cash deposits required under fuel hedge contracts and other contractual obligations. We expect to meet our liquidity needs in 2010 primarily from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and proceeds from the 2010 financing arrangements described below. In addition, the Company may be able to generate a limited amount of liquidity from other sources, including proceeds from aircraft sales and sales of other assets, and potentially, new financing arrangements. While the Company expects to meet its future cash requirements in 2010, our ability to do so could be impacted by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:  

       The global recession has had, and may in the future continue to have, a significant adverse impact on travel demand which has resulted in decreased revenues and may adversely affect revenues in future periods. In addition, the Companys current operational plans to address the weak global economy may not be successful in improving its results of operations and liquidity. Further, certain of the Companys competitors may increase capacity, thereby potentially negatively impacting the Companys unit revenue. The Company may also not achieve expected revenue improvements from merchandising and fee enhancement initiatives;  

       Higher jet fuel prices, and the cost and effectiveness of hedging jet fuel prices, may require the use of significant liquidity in future periods. Crude oil prices have been extremely volatile and unpredictable in recent years and likely will remain volatile in future periods. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was hedged using purchased call options and swaps. The Company has been, and may in the future be, required to make significant payments at the settlement dates of the hedge contracts if the settlement price is below the fixed swap price. Additionally, the Company has been, and may in the future be, required to provide counterparties with additional cash collateral prior to derivative settlement dates. While the Companys results of operations benefit from lower fuel prices on its unhedged fuel consumption, the Company may not realize the full benefit of lower fuel prices due to unfavorable fuel hedge cash settlements. In addition, the Company may not be able to increase its revenues in response to higher fuel prices. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Note 12, Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments in the Footnotes for further information regarding the Companys fuel derivative instruments;  

       The Company has limited remaining assets available as collateral for loans and other indebtedness, which may make it difficult to raise capital to meet its liquidity needs. Our level of indebtedness, non-investment grade credit rating, and credit market conditions may also make it difficult for us to raise capital to meet liquidity needs and may increase our cost of borrowing. A higher cost of capital could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and liquidity;  

       Due to the factors above, and other factors, the Company may be unable to comply with its Amended Credit Facility covenants that currently require the Company to maintain an unrestricted cash balance of $1.0 billion and a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges. If the Company does not comply with these covenants, the lenders may accelerate repayment of these debt obligations, which would have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position and liquidity; and  

       If a default occurs under our Amended Credit Facility or other debt obligations, the cost to cure any such default may materially and adversely impact our financial position and liquidity, and no assurance can be provided that such a default will be mitigated or cured.  

52  

Table of Contents 

Although the factors described above may adversely impact the Companys liquidity, the Company believes it has an adequate available cash position, together with other sources of cash, to fund current operations. UALs unrestricted and restricted cash balances were $3.0 billion and $341 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. In addition, the Company has recently taken actions to improve its liquidity and reduce near-term obligations and believes it may access additional capital in the future, as described below.  

       During 2009, the Companys liquidity initiatives generated unrestricted cash of more than $1.5 billion primarily from the issuance of UAL common stock, proceeds from debt obligations and aircraft asset sale-leasebacks. Additional proceeds of approximately $900 million from financings have either been, or will be, received in 2010 as discussed below. Certain of these initiatives were used to refinance existing debt obligations, significantly reducing the Companys 2010 and 2011 debt obligations;  

       The Company has a limited amount of unencumbered aircraft and other assets may be sold or otherwise used as collateral to obtain additional financing. In addition, in 2010 and 2011, additional aircraft will become unencumbered as various debt and lease obligations mature. These aircraft may be used to obtain new financings; and  

       During 2009 and 2008, the Company took aggressive actions to right-size its business including significant capacity reductions, disposition of underperforming assets and a workforce reduction, among others.  

Cash Position and Liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 25% of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds that primarily invest in U.S. treasury securities and the remainder was invested in AAA-rated money market funds. There are no withdrawal restrictions at the present time on any of the money market funds in which the Company has invested. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our money market fund investments. The following table provides a summary of UALs net cash provided (used) by operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and total cash position as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Companys cash position represents an important source of liquidity. The change in cash from 2007 to 2009 is explained below. Restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers compensation obligations, cash collateral received from fuel derivative counterparties to secure their obligations, security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future. The Company has a $255 million revolving commitment under its Amended Credit Facility, of which $254 million had been used for letters of credit as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, under a separate agreement, the Company had $20 million of letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2009.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities.  

2009 compared to 2008  

UALs cash from operations increased by $2.2 billion in 2009 as compared to the prior year. This improvement was partly due to decreased cash required for aircraft fuel purchases as consolidated fuel purchase  

53  

Table of Contents 

 costs decreased by $4.1 billion in 2009, as compared to 2008. Decreases in the Companys fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately $955 million in 2009, as compared to a use of cash of $965 million in 2008. In addition, the Company received $160 million during 2009 related to the future relocation of its OHare cargo facility as further discussed in Note 14, Lease Obligations, in the Footnotes.  

These operating cash flow benefits were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to lower sales, which decreased by $3.9 billion in 2009, as discussed in Results of Operations, above, and approximately $730 million of payments to counterparties for fuel derivative contract settlements and premiums. In addition, the Company did not have a significant advance sale of miles in 2009 resulting in an unfavorable variance as compared to 2008, during which the Company received $600 million from the Companys advanced sale of miles and license agreement with its co-branded credit card partner, as discussed below.  

In 2009, the Company contributed approximately $245 million and $18 million to its defined contribution plans and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, as compared to contributions of $240 million and $22 million, respectively, in 2008.  

2008 compared to 2007  

UALs cash from operations decreased by $3.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the increased cash required for fuel purchases and operating and nonoperating cash fuel hedge losses. Mainline and Regional Affiliates fuel costs increased $3.1 billion in 2008, over 2007, and nonoperating expenses also increased over the same period largely due to cash and non-cash fuel hedge losses. In addition, certain counterparties to our fuel hedge instruments required the Company to provide cash collateral deposits of approximately $965 million in 2008, which negatively impacted our cash flows during 2008 as compared to 2007, when no similar deposits were required. A decrease in advance ticket sales also negatively impacted operating cash flow in 2008. Partially offsetting the negative impacts were $500 million of proceeds from the advanced purchase of miles by our co-branded credit card partner as part of the amendment of our marketing agreement and $100 million of proceeds from the extension of the license previously granted to our co-branded credit card partner to be the exclusive issuer of Mileage Plus Visa cards through 2017. In 2008, the Company contributed approximately $240 million and $22 million to its defined contribution plans and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, as compared to contributions of $236 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2007 for these plans.  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.  

2009 compared to 2008  

The sale of $2.3 billion of short-term investments throughout 2008 generated significant investing cash flows in 2008 as compared to 2009. As discussed below, these investments were sold as part of the Companys shift to invest available cash into money market funds. UALs capital expenditures, which included capitalized interest, were $317 million and $475 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased significantly in the 2009 period as compared to 2008 because the Company only acquired one aircraft in 2009, as compared to ten aircraft acquired during 2008. In addition, the Company limited its spending in 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highest-value projects. The 2009 and 2008 aircraft acquisitions were completed pursuant to existing lease terms using pre-funded lease deposits, as described below in Cash Flows from Financing Activities.  

In 2009, the Company received $175 million from three sale-leaseback agreements. These transactions were accounted for as capital leases, resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009. The 2008 period included proceeds of $274 million from one sale-leaseback transaction. Other asset sales, including airport slot sales, generated proceeds of $78 million and $94 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

54  

Table of Contents 

2008 compared to 2007  

Net sales of short-term investments provided cash of $2.3 billion for UAL in 2008, as compared to cash used for net purchases of short-term investments of $2.0 billion in 2007. In 2008, the Company invested most of its excess cash in money market funds, whereas in 2007, excess cash was largely invested in short-term investments such as commercial paper. During 2008, the Company also received $357 million of cash that was previously restricted cash held by the Companys largest credit card processor and was released as a part of an amendment to the Companys agreement with this processor. See Credit Card Processing Agreements, below, for further discussion of the amended agreement and future cash reserve requirements.  

In 2008, cash expenditures for property, equipment and software totaled approximately $475 million. Additions to property in 2008 included $20 million of capitalized interest. In 2007, cash expenditures for property and equipment, software and capitalized interest were $639 million, $65 million and $19 million, respectively. This year-over-year decrease is primarily due to the Companys efforts to optimize its available cash and a reduction in cash used to acquire aircraft as the 2007 capital expenditures included cash used to acquire six aircraft that were previously financed as operating leases.  

During 2008, the Company generated $94 million from various asset sales including the sale of five B737 aircraft, spare parts, engines and slots. Investing cash of $274 million was generated from aircraft sold under sale-leaseback financing agreements. In 2008, United entered into a $125 million sale-leaseback involving nine previously unencumbered aircraft and a $149 million sale-leaseback involving 15 aircraft. See Note 14, Lease Obligations and Note 15, Statement of Consolidated Cash FlowsSupplemental Disclosures, in the Footnotes for additional information related to these transactions. In addition, the Companys investing cash flows benefited from $41 million of cash proceeds from a litigation settlement that resulted in the recognition of a $29 million gain during 2008. The litigation settlement related to pre-delivery advance aircraft deposits.  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities.  

2009 Activity  

In 2009, the Company generated gross proceeds of approximately $900 million from the following debt issuances:  

       $158 million from the issuance of $175 million aggregate principal amount of 12.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2012 secured by certain aircraft spare parts;  

       $134 million from a mortgage financing secured by certain of the Companys spare engines;  

       $30 million from an aircraft mortgage financing secured by one B777 aircraft;  

       $345 million from the issuance of 6% Senior Convertible Notes due 2029 (the 6% Senior Convertible Notes);  

       $129 million from a financing with one of the Companys regional flying partners, consisting of an $80 million secured note and a $49 million deferral of future obligations under an amendment to the Companys capacity agreement;  

       $47 million from the issuance of equipment notes relating to the issuance of $659 million aggregate face amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs), Series 2009-1; and  

       $114 million from the issuance of equipment notes relating to the issuance of $810 million aggregate face amount of EETCs, Series 2009-2. See EETC Financing, below, for further information related to the Series 2009-1 and 2009-2 financings.  

In addition, in 2009, the Company generated net proceeds of $222 million from the following equity issuances:  

       $90 million from the completion of the Companys equity offering program that began in 2008, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds under the program of approximately $200 million; and  

55  

Table of Contents 

       $132 million, net of fees, from the issuance of 19.0 million shares of UAL common stock in an underwritten, public offering for a price of $7.24 per share.  

The proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by $984 million used for scheduled long-term debt and capital lease payments during 2009, as well as $49 million used for payment of various costs associated with the financing activities discussed above.  

2008 Activity  

UAL used $253 million for its special distribution to common stockholders (United issued a $257 million dividend to UAL for this distribution) and $919 million for scheduled long-term debt and capital lease payments. United used cash of $109 million in connection with an amendment to its Amended Credit Facility, as further discussed below. In 2008, the Company acquired ten aircraft that were being operated under existing leases. These aircraft were acquired pursuant to existing lease terms. Aircraft lease deposits of $155 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by the Company to make the final payments due under these lease obligations.  

United completed a $241 million credit agreement secured by 26 of the Companys currently owned and mortgaged A319 and A320 aircraft. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The agreement requires periodic principal and interest payments through its final maturity in June 2019. The Company may not prepay the loan prior to July 2012. This agreement did not change the number of the Companys unencumbered aircraft as the Company used available equity in these previously owned and mortgaged aircraft as collateral for this financing.  

United also entered into an $84 million loan agreement secured by three aircraft, including two Airbus A320 and one Boeing B777. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The loan requires principal and interest payments every three months and has a final maturity in June 2015.  

The Company issued 11.2 million shares of UAL common stock as part of a $200 million equity offering during 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had generated net proceeds of $107 million from this offering.  

See Cash Flows from Investing Activities, above, for a discussion of the Companys 2008 sale-leaseback transactions.  

2007 Activity  

In 2007, the Company made a $1.0 billion prepayment on its Amended Credit Facility and made $1.1 billion of additional debt payments, which included $590 million related to the early retirement of debt. The Company prepaid an additional $500 million of the Amended Credit Facility in December 2007. In addition, the Company completed a $694 million debt issuance, which effectively refinanced the aforementioned early debt retirement and refinanced three aircraft that had been previously financed through operating lease agreements.  

In 2007, the Company completed financing transactions totaling approximately $964 million which included $694 million related to the EETC secured financing and $270 million of Denver Bonds. A portion of the proceeds of the $694 million EETC transaction was used to repay $590 million of debt obligations that were secured by ten previously mortgaged, owned aircraft and to finance three previously unencumbered owned aircraft. The proceeds from the Denver Bonds were used to refinance the former $261 million of Denver Series 1992A bonds.  

In 2007, cash from aircraft lease deposits increased $80 million primarily due to the use of the deposits to purchase the three previously leased assets described above in Cash Flows from Investing Activities. This was reported as a financing cash inflow as the prepayment of the initial deposits were recorded as a financing cash outflow.

Other Financing Matters  

Secured Notes Offering. In January 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 (the Senior Secured Notes) and $200 million aggregate principal amount of 12.0% Senior Second Lien Notes due 2013 (the Senior Second Lien Notes). The Senior Secured Notes and Senior Second Lien Notes are secured by Uniteds route authority to operate between the United States and Japan and beyond Japan to points in other countries, certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes. Among other covenants, the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Second Lien Notes contain covenants related to the collateral, including covenants requiring United, subject to certain exceptions, to maintain ownership of the collateral and to calculate the priority lien debt value ratio or secured debt value ratio, as applicable, and to maintain a minimum priority lien debt value ratio or minimum secured debt value ratio, as applicable, as of certain reference periods.  

EETC Financing. In January 2010, the Company issued the remaining principal amount of the equipment notes relating to the Series 2009-1 and 2009-2 EETCs, as discussed in 2009 Activity, above. Issuance proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion were used to repay the Series 2000-2 and 2000-1 EETCs and for general corporate purposes. The issuance of the 2009 EETCs resulted in a reduction in the Companys 2010 and 2011 debt obligations of approximately $440 million and $275 million, respectively. These financing activities resulted in approximately $250 million of incremental liquidity in 2010.  

Encumbered Assets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, a substantial portion of the Companys assets, principally aircraft, spare engines, aircraft spare parts, route authorities and Mileage Plus intangible assets were pledged under various loan and other agreements. In January 2010, the Company completed a debt offering secured by Uniteds route authorities to operate between the United States and Japan and beyond Japan to points in other countries, certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes. As a part of the offering, United requested that these assets, currently encumbered under the Amended Credit Facility, be released and substituted by replacement collateral consisting of aircraft, spare engines, primary slots at LaGuardia and Washington Reagan and flight simulators with an appraised value of approximately $830 million. After the assets are released from the Amended Credit Facility in April 2010, a balance of approximately $200 million in unencumbered assets will remain. In addition, the Amended Credit Facility will include approximately $300 million of excess collateral that can be used for financing if needed, subject to approval from the Amended Credit Facility lenders. See Note 11, Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements, in the Footnotes for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.  

Future Financing. Subject to the restrictions of its Amended Credit Facility and the Notes, the Company could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt, equity or equity-like securities, monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds. However, the availability and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or predicted. General economic conditions, poor credit market conditions, the limited amount of unencumbered assets available as collateral for loans or other indebtedness and any adverse changes in the Companys credit ratings could adversely impact the Companys ability to raise capital, if needed, and could increase the Companys cost of capital.  

Credit Ratings. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a corporate credit rating of B- (outlook negative) from S&P and a corporate family rating of Caa1 from Moodys Investor Services. During 2009, Fitch lowered UALs issuer default rating to CCC from B-. These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability and/or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Matters. The Company may, from time to time, make open market purchases of certain of its debt securities or other financing instruments depending on, among other factors, favorable market conditions and the Companys liquidity position.

Amended Credit Facility Covenants. The Companys Amended Credit Facility requires compliance with certain covenants. The Company was in compliance with all of its Amended Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. In May 2008, the Company amended the terms of certain financial covenants of the Amended Credit Facility. A summary of financial covenants, after the May amendment, is included below.  

The Company must maintain a specified minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of the following fixed charges for all applicable periods: (a) cash interest expense and (b) cash aircraft operating rental expense. EBITDAR represents earnings before interest expense net of interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, aircraft rent and certain other cash and non-cash credits and charges as further defined by the Amended Credit Facility. The other adjustments to EBITDAR include items such as foreign currency transaction losses, increases in our deferred revenue obligation, share-based compensation expense, non-recurring or unusual losses, any non-cash non-recurring charge or non-cash restructuring charge, a limited amount of cash restructuring charges, certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  

The Amended Credit Facility also requires compliance with the following financial covenants: (i) a minimum unrestricted cash balance (as defined by the Amended Credit Facility) of $1.0 billion, and (ii) a minimum collateral ratio of 150% at any time, or 200% at any time following the release of the Pacific (Narita, China and Hong Kong) and Atlantic (London Heathrow) routes (together, the Primary Routes) having an appraised value in excess of $1 billion on the aggregate, unless the Primary Routes are the only collateral then pledged, in which case a minimum collateral ratio of 150% is required. The minimum collateral ratio is calculated as the market value of collateral to the sum of (a) the aggregate outstanding amount of the loans, plus (b) the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus (c) the unreimbursed amount of drawings under such letters of credit and (d) the termination value of certain interest rate protection and hedging agreements with the Amended Credit Facility lenders and their affiliates.  

As discussed above, in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Second Lien Notes in January 2010, certain assets currently encumbered under the Amended Credit Facility are expected to be released and substituted by replacement collateral consisting of aircraft, spare engines, primary slots at LaGuardia and Washington Reagan and flight simulators with an appraised value of approximately $830 million. The assets expected to be released consist of route authorities to operate between the United States and Japan, and beyond Japan to points in other countries, certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes, and were used as collateral for the January 2010 offering.  

The Companys requirement to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio is determined as set forth below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Amended Credit Facility contains a cross default provision with respect to final judgments that exceed $50 million. Although the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants as of December 31, 2009, continued compliance depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Companys control, including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs. There are no assurances that the Company will continue to comply with its debt covenants. Failure to comply with applicable covenants in any reporting period would result in a default under the Amended Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company depending on the Companys ability to obtain a waiver or amendment of such covenants, or otherwise mitigate the impact of the default.

Credit Card Processing Agreements. The Company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Under certain of the Companys card processing agreements, the financial institutions either require, or have the right to require, that United maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution, but for which the Company has not yet provided the air transportation (referred to as relevant advance ticket sales). As of December 31, 2009, the Company had total advance ticket sales of approximately $1.5 billion of which approximately 80% related to credit card sales.  

The Companys credit card processing agreement with Paymentech and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. contains a cash reserve requirement. In addition to certain other risk protections provided to the processor, the amount of cash collateral reserve will be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by the Company as defined under the Amended Credit Facility. If the Companys unrestricted cash balance is at or more than $2.5 billion as of any calendar month-end measurement date, its required reserve will remain at $25 million. However, if the Companys unrestricted cash is less than $2.5 billion, its required reserve will increase to a percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the following table:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the agreement.  

Based on the Companys December 31, 2009 unrestricted cash balance, the Company was not required to provide cash collateral above the current $25 million reserve balance.  

United entered into a new agreement with American Express on March 1, 2009 which has an initial five year term. Under the agreement, in addition to certain other risk protections provided to American Express, the Company will be required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash balance and net current exposure as of any calendar month-end measurement date, as summarized in the following table:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the agreement.  

 (b) Net current exposure equals relevant advance ticket sales less certain exclusions, and as adjusted for specified amounts payable between United and the processor, as further defined by the agreement.  

The agreement with American Express permits the Company to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral, as long as the Companys unrestricted cash is above $1.35 billion. Such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof, with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement. Replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft, slots and routes, real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties. Based on the Companys unrestricted cash balance at December 31, 2009, the Company was not required to provide any reserves under this agreement.  

An increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of either, or both, of the Companys material credit card processing agreements, could materially reduce the Companys liquidity.

Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Companys business is very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.  

The table below provides a summary of UALs material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Long-term debt presented in the Companys Financial Statements is net of a $347 million debt discount which is being amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount. Uniteds contractual principal payments are approximately $345 million lower than UALs due to the UAL 6% Senior Convertible Notes.  

 (b) Mainline includes non-aircraft capital lease payments aggregating approximately $22 million in years 2010 through 2013.  

 (c) Includes interest portion of Mainline and Regional Affiliates capital lease obligations of $178 million in 2010, $106 million in 2011, $86 million in 2012, $80 million in 2013, $70 million in 2014 and $155 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.  

 (d) Amounts represent operating lease payments that are made by United under capacity purchase agreements with the regional carriers who operate these aircraft on Uniteds behalf.  

 (e) Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2019. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded. Not included in the table above are contributions related to the Companys foreign pension plans. The Company does not have any significant contributions required by government regulations. The Companys expected foreign pension plan contributions for 2010 are $12 million.  

 (f) Amounts exclude aircraft orders of $2.3 billion for the purchase of, in the aggregate, 42 A319 and A320 aircraft. Amounts are excluded because these orders are not legally binding purchase orders. The Company may cancel its orders, which would result in forfeiture of its deposits. Amounts in the table include commitments to upgrade international aircraft with our premium cabin product.  

 (g) Lease deposits of $326 million are recorded in the Companys Financial Statements and will be applied to future aircraft lease obligations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for additional information.

Table of Contents 

 (h) Contractual long-term debt includes $109 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a company that leases three aircraft from United. The creditors only recourse to United is repossession of the aircraft.  

 (i) The Companys current and long-term portions of debt presented in its December 31, 2009 Financial Statements reflects the reclassification of $449 million of current obligations, which were refinanced in 2010, to long-term obligations. See Note 11, Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements, for pro-forma adjustments from contractual maturities at December 31, 2009 to the pro-forma amounts, which reflect the aforementioned reclassification and incremental debt issued.  

See Note 1(i), Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRegional Affiliates, Note 8, Retirement and Postretirement Plans, Note 11, Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements and Note 14, Lease Obligations, in the Footnotes for additional discussion of the items included in the table above.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. The Companys off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below, and letters of credit, of which $274 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009.  

Certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of United to finance the construction of improvements at airport-related facilities. The Company also leases facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport-related projects. At December 31, 2009, the Company guaranteed interest and principal payments on $270 million in principal of Denver Bonds that were originally issued in 1992, subsequently refinanced in 2007, and are due in 2032 unless the Company elects not to extend its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the Companys Financial Statements because the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term through 2032. The annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the Denver Bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above. For further details, see Note 13, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and UncertaintiesGuarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Financing, in the Footnotes.  

Fuel Consortia. The Company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt. Uniteds exposure is approximately $214 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Companys exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to 2040. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.

Other Information  

Foreign Operations. The Companys Financial Statements reflect material amounts of intangible assets related to the Companys Pacific and Latin American route authorities and its operations at London Heathrow. Because operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact, and significantly impair, the value of our international route authorities and other assets. Significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on the Companys operating revenues and expenses and results of operations. For further information, see Item 1, BusinessInternational Regulation, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 3, Asset Impairments and Intangible Assets in the Footnotes, for further information on the Companys foreign currency risks associated with its foreign operations.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Financial Statements and the Footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the Financial Statements.  

Passenger Revenue Recognition. The value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders (MCOs) is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. United records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as operating revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket expires. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date. Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is collected. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Companys additional service to modify a previous reservation. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets expire after one year. MCOs can be either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after issuance. United records an estimate of tickets that have been used, but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors, as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results. United also records an estimate of MCOs that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the redemption period based on historical results. Due to complex industry pricing structures, refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results.  

Accounting for Frequent Flyer Program Miles Sold to Third Parties and the Advanced Purchase of Miles. The Company has an agreement with its co-branded credit card partner that requires its partner to purchase miles in advance of when miles will be awarded to the co-branded partners cardholders (referred to as pre-purchased miles). The pre-purchased miles are deferred when received by United in our Financial Statements as Advanced purchase of miles. The Company amended its agreement with its co-branded credit card partner in 2008. See Note 16, Advanced Purchase of Miles, in the Footnotes for a description of this agreement and its 2008 amendment. Subsequently, when the Companys credit card partner awards pre-purchased miles to its cardholders, the Company transfers the related air transportation element for the awarded miles from Advanced purchase of miles to Mileage Plus deferred revenue at estimated fair value and records the residual marketing element as Other operating revenue. The deferred revenue portion is then subsequently recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided in exchange for the miles awarded.  

62  

Table of Contents 

Other Frequent Flyer Accounting Policies.  

The Company has adopted a deferred revenue measurement method to record the fair value of its frequent flyer obligation. This method allocates an equivalent weighted-average ticket value to each outstanding mile, based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed. For miles sold to third parties, the Company recognizes revenue related to the air transportation and marketing-related elements as follows:  

Air Transportation Element. The Company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents estimated fair value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as revenue when transportation is provided. The fair value of the air transportation component is determined based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar fares on United and amounts paid to other airlines for miles. The initial revenue deferral is presented as Mileage Plus deferred revenue in the Financial Statements. When recognized, the revenue related to the air transportation component is classified as Passenger revenues in the Financial Statements.  

Marketing-related Element. The amount of revenue from the marketing-related element is determined by subtracting the fair value of the air transportation from the total sales proceeds. The residual portion of the sales proceeds related to marketing activities is recognized when miles are awarded. This portion is recognized as Other operating revenues in the Financial Statements.  

The value of the deferred revenue is estimated assuming redemptions on both United and other participating carriers in the Mileage Plus program and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the Companys operations, including Domestic, Atlantic, Pacific and Latin America. The estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions, for which significant management judgment is required. For example, management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on United, versus on other airline partners. Since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on United and on other carriers can vary greatly, this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weighted-average ticket value from period to period.  

Management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of Mileage Plus customers, who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles, each of which can have materially different estimated fair values. Such choices include different classes of service (first, business and several coach award levels), as well as different flight itineraries, such as domestic and international routings and varied itineraries within domestic and international regions of Uniteds and other participating carriers route networks. Customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes, which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices, or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices. Management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior. Management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates, but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue.  

The Company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles, regardless of whether or not the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award. Eventually these customers accumulate enough miles to redeem awards, or their accounts deactivate after a period of inactivity, in which case the Company recognizes the related revenue through its revenue recognition policy for expired miles.   

The Company recognizes revenue related to expected expired miles over the estimated redemption period. Based on analysis of mileage redemption and expiration patterns, the Company estimates that 24% of earned miles will expire or go unredeemed. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Companys outstanding number of miles was approximately 457.6 billion and 478.2 billion, respectively. The Company estimates that approximately 349.1 billion of the outstanding miles at December 31, 2009 will ultimately be redeemed based on assumptions as of December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 1% change in the Companys outstanding number of miles or the weighted-average ticket value has approximately a $41 million effect on the  

63  

Table of Contents 

 liability. The Companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance, as well as recognized revenues from the program.  

Asset Impairments.  

The Company recorded impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as presented in the table below. All of these impairment charges are within the Mainline segment. All of the impairments, other than the goodwill impairment which is separately identified, are classified within Other impairments and special items in the Financial Statements.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2009, the Company performed interim and annual impairment tests of its intangible assets and certain of its long-lived assets, principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts, due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred. The primary factors deemed by management to have constituted a potential impairment triggering event were a significant decline in unit revenues experienced in early 2009 and decreases in forecasted revenues. The Company performed a second interim impairment test of certain aircraft fleet types in 2009 due to an additional decrease in market prices, as further discussed below.  

Similarly during 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill, all intangible assets and certain of its long-lived assets, principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts, as of May 31, 2008 due to events and changes in circumstances during the first and second quarters of 2008 that indicated an impairment might have occurred. Factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted an impairment triggering event included record high fuel prices, significant losses in the first and second quarters of 2008, a softening U.S. economy, analyst downgrade of UAL common stock, rating agency changes in outlook for the Companys debt instruments from stable to negative, the planned removal from UALs fleet of 100 aircraft and a significant decrease in the fair value of the Companys outstanding equity and debt securities, including a decline in UALs market capitalization to significantly below book value.  

Discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset impairment shown in the table above.  

Aircraft and Definite-lived Intangible Asset Impairments  

2009 Impairment Testing  

The Company tested certain of its definite-lived intangible assets at February 28, 2009 and determined that the carrying value of its definite-lived intangible assets was fully recoverable because their carrying amount  

64  

Table of Contents 

 exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to their use. As of February 28, 2009, the Company also tested its aircraft for impairment. For all but two fleet types, the Company determined that the fleet types were not impaired as estimated cash flows exceeded carrying value. For the two fleet types which had estimated undiscounted cash flows less than carrying value, the Company estimated the fair value of these fleet types and determined that the aircraft were not impaired as the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value. For purposes of testing impairment of aircraft, the estimated undiscounted cash flows were dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs (including fuel prices) and other relevant assumptions. If estimates of fair value were required, fair value was estimated using the market approach. Asset appraisals, published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by the Company in its market value determination.  

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company tested five of its owned regional jets, which are leased to a third party, for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of approximately one year. As a result of this testing, the Company recorded impairment charges of $19 million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of December 31, 2009.  

On a quarterly basis in 2009, the Company reviewed the carrying values of its nonoperating B737 and five B747 aircraft, which are being marketed for sale, to assess whether the carrying values were recoverable. As a result of this testing, the carrying value of the nonoperating B737s and five nonoperating B747 aircraft was reduced to a lower estimated fair value resulting in charges of $19 million and $55 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively.  

2008 Impairment Testing  

The Company tested all aircraft for impairment as of May 31, 2008 for the reasons discussed above. Based on the results of these tests, the Company determined that an impairment of $38 million existed which was attributable to the Companys fleet of owned B737 aircraft and related spare parts. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the Company performed an impairment test of its B737 aircraft. Based on this analysis, the Company recorded an additional charge of $107 million to reduce the carrying value of the B737 aircraft. As described in Note 2, Company Operational Plans, in the Footnotes, the Company retired its entire B737 fleet earlier than originally planned.  

Due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described above, the Company also determined in the second quarter of 2008 that it was required to perform an impairment test of its $105 million of pre-delivery aircraft deposits and related capitalized interest. The Company determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired and wrote off their full carrying value. The Company believes that it is highly unlikely that it will take these future aircraft deliveries and, therefore, the Company will be required to forfeit the deposits, which are not transferable based on existing contract terms.   

As a result of the 2008 impairment testing described above, the Companys goodwill and certain of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and tangible assets were recorded at fair value. The Company was not required to apply certain new fair value accounting principles to the determination of the fair value of these assets in 2008 as the new principles were not effective for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. However, the provisions of this standard were applied to the determination of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that were part of the Step Two goodwill fair value determination.  

Due to extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, the uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties, the Company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge will not occur in a future period. The Company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional asset impairment testing is warranted.

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets  

2009 Interim Impairment Test  

As of February 28, 2009, the Company performed an interim impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets due to events and changes in circumstances during the first quarter of 2009 that indicated an impairment might have occurred, as discussed above.  

Indefinite-lived intangible assets tested for impairment included tradenames, international route authorities, London Heathrow slots and codesharing agreements. The Company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to separately estimate the fair values of all of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 28, 2009, and compared those estimates to related carrying values. The methods used to test these assets were primarily income methodologies, which were based on estimated future cash flows, except for the valuation of the London Heathrow slots, for which fair value was estimated using the market approach. As of February 28, 2009, the only impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was related to the carrying value of Uniteds tradenames in the amount $40 million. In addition, the Company performed a second interim impairment test of only tradenames as of May 31, 2009, which resulted in an additional impairment of $110 million. As a result of both of the impairment tests, the Company recorded impairment charges of $150 million to decrease the carrying value of the tradenames to estimated fair value as of May 31, 2009.  

2008 Interim Impairment Test  

The Company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to separately estimate the fair values of all of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2008 and compared those estimates to related carrying values. Tested assets included tradenames, international route authorities, London Heathrow slots and codesharing agreements. The Company used a market or income valuation approach, as described above, to estimate fair values. Based on the results of this testing, the Company recorded a $64 million impairment charge to indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2008.  

Annual Impairment Tests  

United performed annual impairment reviews of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2009 and 2008 and determined that no impairment was indicated.  

Goodwill.  

For purposes of testing goodwill in 2008, the Company estimated the fair value of the Mainline reporting unit (to which all goodwill is allocated) utilizing several fair value measurement techniques, including two market estimates and one income estimate and using relevant data available through, and as of, May 31, 2008. The market approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets. The valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets. The income approach is a technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life, including residual value cash flows. These cash flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money.  

Under the market approaches, the fair value of the Mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of invested capital for UAL, as well as a separate comparison to revenue and EBITDAR multiples for similar publicly traded companies in the airline industry. The fair value estimates using both market approaches included a control premium similar to those observed for historical airline and transportation company market transactions.

Under the income approach, the fair value of the Mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows for UAL. The income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs (including fuel prices), appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions. The Company estimated its future fuel-related cash flows for the income approach based on the five-year forward curve for crude oil as of May 31, 2008. The impacts of the Companys aircraft and other tangible and intangible asset impairments were considered in the fair value estimation of the Mainline reporting unit.  

Taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market estimates and the income estimate, which has been the Companys practice when performing annual goodwill impairment tests, the indicated fair value of the Mainline reporting unit was less than its carrying value, and therefore, the Company was required to perform additional goodwill impairment testing. For this testing, the Company determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the Mainline reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the Mainline reporting unit, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, as if the Mainline reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the Mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price. As a result of this testing, the Company determined that goodwill was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment charge during the second quarter of 2008 to write-off the full value of goodwill.  

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets. The net book value of operating property and equipment for UAL was $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition to the original cost of these assets, as adjusted by fresh-start reporting as of February 1, 2006, their recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.  

The Company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of United and the practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the Companys fleet plan and other relevant information. A one year increase in the average depreciable life of our flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $17 million.  

Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting. The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its Financial Statements. Under GAAP, other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. The Company has not been required to pre-fund its current and future plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below.  

The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $58 million and $57 million, respectively, for the other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligation was $2.0 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The difference between the plan assets and obligations has been recorded in the Financial Statements. Detailed information regarding the Companys other postretirement plans, including key assumptions, is included in Note 8, Retirement and Postretirement Plans, in the Footnotes.  

The following provides a summary of the methodology used to determine the assumptions disclosed in Note 8, Retirement and Postretirement Plans, in the Footnotes. The calculation of other postretirement benefit

 expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates were based on the construction of theoretical corporate bond portfolios, adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the payment of the Companys future postretirement obligations. A yield curve was developed based on a subset of these bonds (those with yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles). The projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a present value developed, which was then calibrated to develop a single equivalent risk-adjusted discount rate.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. The Companys accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable GAAP with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the corridor approach, amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is only required if, at the beginning of the year, the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense. The corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year. Since the Company has elected not to apply the corridor approach, all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had unrecognized actuarial gains of $155 million and $286 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans.  

Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets. At December 31, 2009, UAL and United had valuation allowances applied to its deferred tax assets of approximately $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. In accordance with accounting principles related to income taxes, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period available under the tax law. Sources of future taxable income include future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable differences, taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies. These sources of positive evidence of realizability must be weighed against negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. A recent history of losses would make difficult a determination that a valuation allowance is not needed.  

In forming a judgment about the future realization of our deferred tax assets, management considered both the positive and negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight to the negative evidence from our cumulative losses for recent years. Management will continue to assess the valuation allowance and make appropriate adjustments based on the positive and negative evidence existing at that time. The Company is currently unable to forecast when there will be sufficient positive evidence for it to reverse the remainder of the valuation allowances that are recorded. Any reversals of valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense. See Note 7, Income Taxes, in the Footnotes for additional information.
