ITEM 7A.   

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2007, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $404,990,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 6.18% was subject to LIBOR caps. These caps are based on a notional amount of $412,000,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 6.34%.  

As of December 31, 2007, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $121,476,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. 

Fair Value of Our Debt 

The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2007 approximates its aggregate carrying amount, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. 

Derivative Instruments 

We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recognized net gains aggregating approximately $113,503,000, $153,208,000 and $73,953,000, respectively, from these positions.
