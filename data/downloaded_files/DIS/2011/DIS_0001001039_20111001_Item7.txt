CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

2011 vs. 2010  

Revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $40.9 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 21%, or $844 million, to $4.8 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) increased 24% to $2.52.  

Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2011 included $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains from the sales of businesses of $75 million. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of these items.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Restructuring and impairment charges include an impairment of assets that had tax basis significantly in excess of book value resulting in a $47 million tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges. The gains on sales of businesses included the sale of Miramax which had a book value that included $217 million of allocated goodwill which is not tax deductible. Accordingly, the taxable gain on the sales of businesses exceeded the $75 million book gain resulting in tax expense of $107 million. These items collectively had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS compared to the items in fiscal 2010 that are discussed below which had a net adverse impact of $0.04 on EPS.  

The increase in EPS for fiscal 2011 reflected higher operating results driven by higher revenues from MVSPs (Affiliate Fees) at our Cable Networks, increased guest spending and volumes at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN, lower film cost write-downs, decreased programming and production costs at the ABC Television Network, higher licensing revenue due to the strength of Cars merchandise and a full-period of results for Marvel, and higher equity income at AETN/Lifetime. These increases were partially offset by higher costs at ESPN and at our domestic parks and resorts, lower performance at our theatrical business, and the inclusion of a full-period of results for Playdom in the current year, which included the impact of acquisition accounting.

2010 vs. 2009  

Revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 5%, or $1.9 billion, to $38.1 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 20%, or $656 million, to $4.0 billion; and EPS increased 15% to $2.03.  

Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2010 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.09 per diluted share), gains on the sales of investments in two television services in Europe ($0.02 per diluted share), a gain on the sale of the Power Rangers property ($0.01 per diluted share), and an accounting gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan ($0.01 per diluted share), which, including the impact of rounding, collectively had a net adverse impact of $0.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.17 per diluted share), a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and AETN ($0.08 per diluted share) and a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($0.04 per diluted share). Including the impact of rounding, these items collectively resulted in a net adverse impact of $0.06 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 results also include an additional week of operations due to our fiscal period end.  

The increase in EPS for fiscal 2010 reflected higher operating results due to higher Affiliate Fees at our Cable Networks, increased advertising revenues at our cable and broadcast businesses, the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2, and lower distribution and marketing costs at our home entertainment business, partially offset by higher costs at our cable business and at our domestic parks and resorts operations.  

Restructuring and Impairment Charges  

The Company recorded $55 million of charges in fiscal 2011 reflecting severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at the Studio Entertainment and Interactive Media segments.  

The Company recorded $270 million of charges in fiscal 2010 related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily for severance and other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations.  

The Company recorded charges totaling $492 million in fiscal 2009 which included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213 million. The most significant of the impairment charges were $142 million related to FCC radio licenses and $65 million related to our investment in UTV. The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result of organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses.  

Other Income  

Other income is as follows (in millions):

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2011 vs. 2010  

Below is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other expenses and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third party and internal marketing expenses.  

Our Media Networks segment generates revenue from Affiliate Fees charged to MVSPs, advertising revenues from the sale to advertisers of time in programs for commercial announcements and other revenues which include the sale and distribution of television programming. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technical support costs, distribution costs and operating labor.  

Our Parks and Resorts segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of room nights at hotels, merchandise, food and beverage sales, sales and rentals of vacation club properties and the sale of cruise vacation packages. Operating expenses include labor, costs of sales, repairs and maintenance and entertainment.  

Our Studio Entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Operating expenses include film cost amortization, which consists of production cost amortization, participations and residuals, costs of sales and distribution expenses.  

Our Consumer Products segment generates revenue from licensing characters from our film, television and other properties, publishing childrens books and magazines and comic books, and operating retail stores, English language learning centers and internet shopping sites. Operating expenses include costs of goods sold, distribution, operating labor and retail occupancy costs.  

Our Interactive Media segment generates revenue from the development and sale of multi-platform games, online advertising and sponsorships, subscriptions to and micro transactions for online games, and content and handset revenue from our Disney-branded mobile phone business in Japan. Certain properties are also licensed to third-party game publishers. Operating expenses include product development, costs of goods sold and distribution expenses.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Companys portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes.

Media Networks  

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Certain reclassifications have been made in the numbers presented in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 to conform to the fiscal 2011 presentation  

Revenues  

Affiliate Fee growth of 9% was driven by increases of 6% from higher contractual rates, 1% from favorable impacts of foreign currency translation, and 1% from subscriber growth at Cable Networks and an increase of 1% from Broadcasting due to new contractual provisions.  

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $471 million at Cable Networks from $3,051 million to $3,522 million and an increase of $99 million at Broadcasting from $3,977 million to $4,076 million. The increase at Cable Networks of 14% was due to higher rates. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 6% due to higher Network advertising rates, primarily at primetime, and 1% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 4% due to lower Network ratings primarily at primetime and daytime.  

The increase in other revenues was driven by a change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher sales of Disney Channel programming, partially offset by lower sales of ABC Studios productions driven by no new seasons of Lost and Ghost Whisperer.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $249 million from $8,453 million to $8,702 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production spending of $457 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to the addition of college football programming including Bowl Championship Series games, increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming and more episodes of original programming at the Disney Channels, partially offset by the absence of programming costs for the FIFA World Cup which was broadcast in the prior year. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $208 million reflecting lower news and daytime production costs due to cost savings initiatives, a lower cost mix of programming in primetime due to a shift of hours from original scripted programming to reality programming, a shift of college sports programming to ESPN and lower production cost amortization due to a decrease in sales of ABC Studios productions. Operating expenses also reflected a 2% increase due to a change in the transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and a 1% increase due to higher labor costs at ESPN due to headcount growth and labor cost inflation.  

The increase in selling, general and administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing and sales costs, which included an increase due to the change in transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher marketing costs at ESPN.  

Equity in the Income of Investees  

Income from equity investees increased to $584 million in the current year from $438 million in the prior year driven by an increase at AETN/Lifetime primarily due to the absence of a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs at AETN/Lifetime in the prior year and higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher marketing costs.  

30  

Table of Contents 

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 20%, or $1.0 billion, to $6.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, the ABC Television Network, the worldwide Disney Channels, our AETN/Lifetime joint venture and the owned television stations.  

The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Restructuring and impairment charges  

The Company recorded charges of $3 million, $95 million and $315 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. The charges in fiscal 2009 were primarily due to $142 million of radio FCC license impairments, a $65 million impairment charge related to our investment in UTV and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Parks and Resorts  

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues  

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1 billion, to $11.8 billion due to an increase of $898 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $138 million at our international operations.  

Revenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 6% increase driven by higher average guest spending and a 3% increase due to volume driven by higher passenger cruise ship days due to the launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream, in January 2011, and higher attendance. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, daily hotel room rates, and food, beverage, and merchandise spending.  

Revenue growth of 6% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase due to higher average guest spending, a 3% increase driven by volume due to higher attendance and hotel occupancy, and a 3% favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease due to the prior-year sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris and a 1% decrease due to the temporary closure of the Tokyo Disney Resort following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.  

31  

Table of Contents 

The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.  

 (2)   Per capita guest spending and per room guest spending include the impact of foreign currency translation. Guest spending statistics for Disneyland Paris were converted from Euros into US Dollars at weighted average exchange rates of 1.39 and 1.36 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses include operating labor which increased by $262 million from $3,278 million to $3,540 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses. Operating expenses also include cost of sales which increased $88 million from $1,110 million to $1,198 million driven by volume, partially offset by the absence of the costs related to a prior-year real estate sale at Disneyland Paris. Operating expenses also increased due to launch and operating costs in connection with the Disney Dream, enhancement and expansion costs, including new guest offerings at Disney California Adventure and investments in our systems infrastructure, and costs for Aulani, our new hotel and vacation club resort in Hawaii. In addition there was an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing costs at our domestic parks and resorts, costs associated with the additional cruise ship and our new resort in Hawaii, and labor cost inflation.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 18%, or $235 million, to $1.6 billion due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by costs for our new resort in Hawaii and a decrease at Tokyo Disney Resort.  

Studio Entertainment  

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

32  

Table of Contents 

Revenues  

The decrease in theatrical distribution revenue reflected the prior-year success of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 compared to the performance of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Cars 2, Thor and Captain America in the current year.  

Lower home entertainment revenue reflected an 11% decrease due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement for Studio distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product, partially offset by a 1% increase due to higher net effective pricing internationally which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns.  

The increase in television distribution and other revenues reflected 5% growth due to the inclusion of Marvel which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of the prior year and a 4% increase due to higher revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise.  

Cost and Expenses  

Operating expenses included a decrease of $262 million in film cost amortization, from $2,142 million to $1,880 million, driven by lower film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include cost of sales and distribution expenses which decreased $71 million from $1,327 million to $1,256 million primarily due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product.  

Selling, general, administrative and other costs were essentially flat as higher marketing for Marvel titles and an increase in technology infrastructure spending were largely offset by lower theatrical pre-release marketing expense and the change in the transfer pricing arrangement with Media Networks for home entertainment product.  

The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by higher amortization on intangible assets related to certain Marvel film properties.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income decreased 11%, or $75 million, to $618 million primarily due to lower results at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses and higher technology infrastructure spending, partially offset by lower film cost write-downs and a higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment.  

Restructuring and impairment charges  

The Company recorded charges of $33 million, $151 million and $47 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2011 and 2009 were primarily for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2010 were primarily for the closure of a production facility, the write-offs of capitalized costs related to abandoned film projects, and severance costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Consumer Products  

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

33  

Table of Contents 

Revenues  

The increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a 6% increase driven by the strong performance of Cars, Tangled and Toy Story merchandise and a 8% increase due to higher revenue from Marvel properties. Higher revenues from Marvel properties reflected the impact of acquisition accounting which reduced revenue recognition in the prior year as well as a full year of operations as Marvel was acquired at the end of the first quarter of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease due to a higher revenue share to the Studio Entertainment segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise.  

The increase in retail and other revenues was primarily due to a 9% increase from higher revenues at the Disney Store in North America and Europe driven by higher comparable store sales and a 6% increase resulting from the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan, which was acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010.  

Licensing and publishing and retail and other revenues also increased by 2% and 3%, respectively, due to the benefit from a favorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses included an increase of $57 million in cost of goods sold, from $521 million to $578 million, driven by the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. Operating expenses also included a 2% increase due to higher occupancy costs driven by an increase at our retail business reflecting the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and a 1% increase due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro; the inclusion of a full year of operations for Marvel and various promotional initiatives across multiple businesses.  

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets for Marvel and an increase at the Disney Stores due to an increase in new stores and remodels.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 21%, or $139 million, to $816 million primarily due to increases in our Merchandise Licensing and North American retail businesses.  

Restructuring and impairment charges  

The Company recorded charges totaling $16 million and $19 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were for severance and related costs which were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Interactive Media  

Operating results for the Interactive Media segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

34  

Table of Contents 

Revenues  

Game sales and subscriptions revenue growth reflected a 12% increase due to higher console game unit sales and a 10% increase due to higher net effective pricing of console games, reflecting the strong performance of Epic Mickey and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and a shift in sales from catalog titles to new releases. Additionally, the inclusion of Playdom for a full year compared to one month in the prior year resulted in a 10% increase in game sales and subscription revenues.  

Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by our mobile phone service in Japan.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expense included a $60 million increase in product development expense from $335 million to $395 million primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year. Operating expenses also included a 12% increase due to higher cost of sales driven by fees paid to the developer of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and higher console game unit sales.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting.  

Segment Operating Loss  

Segment operating loss was $308 million compared to $234 million in the prior year as an improvement at our console game business was more than offset by the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting.  

Restructuring and impairment charges  

The Company recorded charges totaling $22 million, $2 million and $42 million related to Interactive Media for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2009 were for goodwill impairment and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2011 vs. 2010  

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses  

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 9%, from $420 million to $459 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses and compensation related costs.  

Net Interest Expense  

Net interest expense is detailed below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense for the year reflected lower effective interest rates.  

The increase in interest and investment income for the year was driven by gains on sales of investments.  

Effective Income Tax Rate  

The effective tax rate decreased 0.3 percentage points from 34.9% in 2010 to 34.6% in 2011 as the absence of a charge related to the health care reform legislation and a benefit from an increase in the domestic production deduction rate were largely offset by a decrease in favorable resolutions of prior-year tax matters. During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $72 million charge related to the enactment of health care reform legislation in March 2010. Under this legislation the Companys deductions for retiree prescription drug benefits will be reduced by the amount of Medicare Part D drug subsidies received beginning in fiscal year 2014. Under applicable accounting rules, the Company was required to reduce its existing deferred tax asset, which was established for the future deductibility of retiree prescription drug benefit costs, to reflect the lost deductions. The reduction was recorded as a charge to earnings in the period the legislation was enacted.

Table of Contents 

Noncontrolling Interests  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $101 million to $451 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.  

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS  

Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $576 million, $482 million, and $214 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2011 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.  

We expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $50 million to $626 million in fiscal 2012 driven by a lower assumed discount rate, partially offset by a favorable impact due to plan amendments. The decrease in the discount rate also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $4.2 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) as of October 1, 2011. If our investment performance does not improve relative to our long-term assumption and/or discount rates do not increase, we expect that pension and postretirement medical costs will continue at levels comparable to fiscal 2012 for the next few years as a result of amortizing these unrecognized expenses. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements and amendments we made to our plans in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, the Company contributed $935 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2012 to total approximately $325 million to $375 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2012 will be determined based on our January 1, 2012 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2012. See Item 1A  Risk Factors for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.  

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2010 vs. 2009  

Media Networks  

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues  

The 9% increase in Affiliate Fees, which are generally derived from fees charged on a per-subscriber basis, was primarily due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth at Cable Networks which resulted in revenue increases of 5% and 4%, respectively, partially offset by the impact of one fewer week of operations.  

36  

Table of Contents 

Higher advertising revenues were due to increases of $362 million at Cable Networks from $2,689 million to $3,051 million and of $100 million at Broadcasting from $3,877 million to $3,977 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 9% due to higher sold inventory. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 4% due to higher network advertising rates and sold inventory and 3% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a 4% decrease due to lower network ratings and one fewer week of operations.  

Other revenues decreased $94 million at Cable Networks and $90 million at Broadcasting. The decrease at Cable Networks was driven by the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected lower domestic television syndication revenues due to the sales of According to Jim and Greys Anatomy in fiscal 2009.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses include an increase in programming and production costs of $377 million from $8,076 million to $8,453 million. At Cable Networks an increase in programming and production costs of $446 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to new international sports programming rights and increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming. At Broadcasting a decrease in programming and production costs of $69 million was driven by costs savings at news and daytime and a lower cost mix of programming in primetime.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher pension and postretirement medical and compensation related costs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $60 million due to the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with a bankruptcy of a syndication customer in fiscal 2009 and a decrease due to the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010.  

Equity in the Income of Investees  

Income from equity investees decreased to $438 million in fiscal 2010 from $567 million in fiscal 2009 driven by a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs at AETN/Lifetime in fiscal 2010.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 8%, or $367 million, to $5.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, the owned television stations and the international Disney Channels, partially offset by lower equity income.

Parks and Resorts  

 Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues  

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 1%, or $94 million, to $10.8 billion due to an increase of $132 million at our international operations, partially offset by a decrease of $38 million at our domestic operations.  

The decline in revenue at our domestic operations reflected the impact of one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2010 and a 1% volume decrease reflecting lower vacation club ownership sales, lower hotel occupancy and lower passenger cruise ship days. These decreases were partially offset by higher guest spending primarily due to higher average ticket prices and higher average daily hotel room rates.  

The 6% revenue increase at our international operations reflected increases of 3% due to higher guest spending and 3% due to the sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris as well as higher attendance and hotel occupancy. Higher guest spending was driven by higher average ticket prices and average daily hotel room rates.  

The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses included an increase in operating labor of $173 million from $3,105 million to $3,278 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses, partially offset by a decrease in costs of sales of $57 million from $1,167 million to $1,110 million primarily due to decreased sales volume. In addition, operating expenses reflected increased costs for new guest offerings including World of Color at Disneyland Resort.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by increased marketing costs in support of the Disney Cruise Line fleet expansion and also World of Color at Disneyland Resort as well as labor cost inflation.

The Company recorded charges totaling $54 million related to Parks and Resorts in fiscal 2009 for severance and related costs which were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  

Studio Entertainment  

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues  

The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the strong performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in fiscal 2010, compared to Up and The Proposal in fiscal 2009.  

The decrease in home entertainment revenues was primarily due to a 2% decrease reflecting lower net effective pricing and a 2% decrease driven by lower sales volume of new releases domestically. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns.  

The decrease in television distribution and other revenues reflected the strong performance of High School Musical 3 and Rascal Flatts CD titles in fiscal 2009 as well as the Cheetah Girls concert tour in fiscal 2009.  

Cost and Expenses  

Operating expenses included an increase in film cost amortization of $385 million from $1,757 million to $2,142 million driven by the strong performance of our key theatrical releases and higher film cost write-downs, partially offset by a decrease in costs of goods sold of $35 million from $384 million to $349 million driven by cost reduction initiatives at our home entertainment business.  

Selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses reflected a decrease in marketing costs at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased from $175 million to $693 million primarily due to the improvements in our theatrical and home entertainment businesses, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs.

Consumer Products  

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues  

The increase in licensing and publishing revenue was primarily due to an increase of $221 million resulting from the acquisition of Marvel and the strong performance of Toy Story merchandise, partially offset by a higher revenue share with the Studio Entertainment segment of $90 million.  

Higher retail and other revenues were driven by a $69 million increase due to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and an increase of $33 million at The Disney Store North America and Europe reflecting higher comparable store sales.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses included cost of goods sold of $521 million which was comparable to fiscal 2009 as increases due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel were offset by lower third-party royalties on licensing revenues and decreased costs of sales at The Disney Store North America due to an improved global purchasing strategy. Other operating costs increased due to the addition of Marvel and The Disney Store Japan.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other was driven by the acquisitions of Marvel and The Disney Store Japan.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 11%, or $68 million, to $677 million due to improved results at our retail business and an increase in our publishing business driven by Marvel titles.  

Interactive Media  

Operating results for the Interactive Media segment are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

Revenues  

Game sales and subscription revenue was essentially flat as lower unit sales of self published console games were offset by higher subscription revenues at Club Penguin. Significant titles in fiscal 2010 included Toy Story 3, Split Second and Sing It 2 while fiscal 2009 included High School Musical 3, Sing It and Bolt.   

Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by increases at our mobile phone service business in Japan and in online advertising.  

Costs and Expenses  

Operating expenses included a decrease in costs of goods sold of $70 million from $266 million to $196 million due to lower video game costs reflecting a sales mix shift from higher cost new releases, which included bundled accessories, in fiscal 2009 to lower cost catalog titles in fiscal 2010. This decrease was partially offset by increased product development expense of $24 million.  

The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected higher marketing costs driven by Toy Story 3 and Split Second.  

Segment Operating Loss  

Segment operating loss decreased 21%, or $61 million, to $234 million driven by improved results at our games and Japan mobile phone service businesses, partially offset by the impact of purchase accounting for Playdom.  

NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2010 vs. 2009  

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses  

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 6%, from $398 million to $420 million, primarily due to higher information technology and compensation costs.  

Net Interest Expense  

Net interest expense is detailed below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average debt balances, partially offset by expense related to the early redemption of a film financing borrowing.  

The decrease in interest and investment income for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior year, lower effective interest rates and lower average cash balances.  

Effective Income Tax Rate  

The effective income tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points from 36.2% in 2009 to 34.9% in 2010. The lower effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to prior-year income tax matters, partially offset by a $72 million charge related to the health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010.  

Noncontrolling Interests  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $48 million to $350 million driven by improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and ESPN. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined based on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2011 increased 6% or $416 million to $7.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer Products and Interactive Media businesses, partially offset by lower revenues at our Studio Entertainment business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments at Corporate and at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Interactive Media, and Consumer Products businesses, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments at our Studio Entertainment business. The increase in cash payments at Corporate was driven by higher contributions to our pension plans, while the increase at Media Networks was primarily due to higher investment in television programming and production. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation, higher promotional and operating costs from the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream, and higher marketing and sales expenses and expansion costs for Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. The increase in cash payments at Interactive Media reflects the inclusion of Playdom, while the increase in cash payments at Consumer Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. The decrease in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by lower film production spending.  

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 increased 24% or $1.3 billion to $6.6 billion as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was driven by higher operating cash receipts at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment businesses and lower cash payments at our Studio Entertainment segment driven by a decrease in distribution and marketing expense, partially offset by higher income tax payments. The increase in cash receipts at our Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments was driven by higher revenues, while the increase in cash receipts at Parks and Resorts was driven by the timing of advance travel deposits.  

Depreciation expense is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Companys Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Companys broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.

Investing Activities  

Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts, and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Companys investments in parks, resorts and other property for the last three years are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, cruise ships, new rides and attractions, recurring capital and capital improvements. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2011 reflected the final payment on our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream, theme park and resort expansions and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the development of Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 reflected higher construction progress payments on the two new cruise ships, the expansions at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disney California Adventure and the construction of Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa in Hawaii. The increase in capital expenditures at Consumer Products from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011 was driven by costs at the Disney Stores for new stores and remodels.  

Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities.  

43  

Table of Contents 

Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The increases in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were driven by investments in equipment and corporate facilities.  

Other Investing Activities  

During fiscal 2011, proceeds from dispositions of $564 million primarily due to the sale of Miramax, were partially offset by acquisitions totaling $184 million which included additional payments related to the acquisition of Playdom, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  

During fiscal 2010, acquisitions totaled $2.5 billion and included the acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Playdom, Inc., and were partially offset by net proceeds totaling $170 million from the sale of our investments in two television services in Europe and the sale of the rights and assets related to the Power Rangers property.  

During fiscal 2009, acquisitions totaled $176 million and included the purchase of additional interests in UTV (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), offset by proceeds totaling $185 million from the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America.  

Financing Activities  

Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 increased by $570 million to $3.2 billion compared to fiscal 2010 and consisted of repurchases of common stock and the payment of dividends partially offset by borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The increase from fiscal 2010 was due to higher repurchases of common stock, partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 decreased by $448 million to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal 2009 and consisted of repurchases of common stock, repayments of borrowings, and the payment of dividends partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The decrease from fiscal 2009 was due to lower repayments of borrowings and increased proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by higher share repurchases.  

During the year ended October 1, 2011, the Companys borrowing activity was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.  

 (2)   The other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.  

 (3)   The other activity is primarily due to the conversion of a portion of the HKSARs loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  

The Companys bank facilities are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In February 2011, the Company entered into a new four-year $2.25 billion bank facility with a syndicate of lenders. This facility, in combination with the facility that matures in 2013, is used to support commercial paper borrowings. The new bank facility allows the Company to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of October 1, 2011, $315 million of letters of credit had been issued of which $47 million was issued under this facility. These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Companys public debt rating and can range from 0.33% to 4.50%.  

44  

Table of Contents 

The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.  

The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($756 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010. The Company paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($653 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009; and paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($648 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to fiscal 2008. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2011.  

During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 135 million shares of Disney common stock for $5.0 billion. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 80 million shares of Disney common stock for $2.7 billion. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of Disney common stock for $138 million. On March 22, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors increased the amount of shares that can be repurchased to 400 million shares as of that date. As of October 1, 2011, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 305 million additional shares.  

We believe that the Companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See Item 1A  Risk Factors. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of October 1, 2011, Moodys Investors Services long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard & Poors long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitchs long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 1, 2011, by a significant margin. The Companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default.  

Disneyland Paris has in its debt agreements certain annual financial performance objectives and limits on investing and financing activities. In fiscal 2011, Disneyland Paris did not meet its annual performance objectives and must defer 25 million of royalties and management fees payable to the Company and 20 million of interest payable to a French state bank. Additionally, as a result of the fact that the performance objectives were not met, certain of Disneyland Pariss investment activities are further limited by the debt agreements.  

Disneyland Paris is also subject to certain financial covenants and believes that it is in compliance with such covenants with the assistance of the Companys agreement, as permitted under the debt agreements, to defer an additional 9 million of royalties payable to the Company into subordinated long-term borrowings.  

The deferrals discussed above and compliance with these financial covenants are subject to final third-party review as provided in Disneyland Pariss debt agreements.  

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

The Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.

Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees  

The Company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.  

Legal and Tax Matters  

As disclosed in Notes 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters.  

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Film and Television Revenues and Costs  

We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.  

46  

Table of Contents 

With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a films release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.  

With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the programs rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Companys ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.  

We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each seasons relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.  

Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are: daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.  

Revenue Recognition  

The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.  

We reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.  

We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a four-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.  

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions  

The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.  

47  

Table of Contents 

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 4.75% at the end of fiscal 2011 from 5.25% at the end of fiscal 2010 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our October 1, 2011 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2012. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2012 by $223 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 1, 2011 by $1.9 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $193 million and $1.6 billion, respectively.  

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% for both of the 2011 and 2010 actuarial valuations. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2012 annual benefit expense by approximately $70 million.  

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.  

Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments  

The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.  

To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.  

In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.  

The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.  

The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the groups long-lived assets and the carrying value of the groups long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

Table of Contents 

The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.  

During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were immaterial. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $279 million, which included $142 million for FCC radio licenses and $65 million for our investment in UTV. The FCC radio license impairment charges reflected overall market declines in certain radio markets in which we operate. These impairment charges, which were estimated using a discounted cash flow model, were recorded in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods.  

Contingencies and Litigation  

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.  

Income Tax Audits  

As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Companys decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Companys success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.  

ACCOUNTING CHANGES  

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The guidance revises the criteria for separating, measuring, and allocating arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable, which must be estimated if the company does not have a history of selling the deliverable on a stand-alone basis or third-party evidence of selling price. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets  

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the requirements for off balance sheet accounting for financial assets including limiting the circumstances where off balance sheet treatment for a portion of a financial asset is allowable, and require additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated. The new consolidation model for VIEs considers whether an entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the VIE. The guidance on VIEs requires companies to continually reassess VIEs to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.

Employee Compensation  Retirement Benefits  

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The guidance on retirement benefits also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the end of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the recognition provision in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a $261 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the measurement date provision by remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations at the beginning of fiscal 2009. Adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a reduction of $35 million to retained earnings and a $100 million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income.
