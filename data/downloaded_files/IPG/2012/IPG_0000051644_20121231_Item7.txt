Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“IPG,” “we,” “us” or “our”). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. Our MD&A includes the following sections:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2012 compared to 2011 and 2011 compared to 2010.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds and debt credit ratings.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2012 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During 2012, our organic revenue increase was driven by international growth, primarily from the high-growth markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America, across our marketing disciplines. Our domestic revenue decline in 2012 was due to certain client losses in 2011. We had growth in the U.S. from our integrated independent agencies and marketing services specialists. We continued to have strong demand for our digital services, which are embedded within all of our agency brands as well as at our digital specialist agencies. Our operating expenses reflected careful and effective cost management, while we continued to make disciplined investments in our agencies.

With challenging economic conditions in many markets around the world, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, marketers continue to show a degree of caution in their marketing investment. We continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base, our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. We continued to enhance our businesses during 2012 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities: fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions and strategic world markets. We believe our continued investment in tools, technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services. As we continue to evolve our services at a rapid pace in this complex and fragmented media environment, we believe we are well positioned for revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the upcoming years. 

We continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends, share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet. During 2012, diluted shares decreased by 11% due to share repurchases as well as the retirement of convertible debt. Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $1.01, $1.12 and $0.57 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $0.94, $0.99 and $0.47 per share, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 included $0.14 and $0.12 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $0.27 and $0.23 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, net of tax. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a benefit of $0.05 per share from the repurchase of a portion of our 5 1/4% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock"). Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 was not impacted by this benefit.

The following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared with the same periods in 2011 and 2010.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. The performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector, where we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitutes approximately 55% to 60% of our annual consolidated revenues. We also analyze revenue by geographic region.

The change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk. Our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency. Both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. The primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2012 include the Brazilian Real, Euro, Indian Rupee and the South African Rand. During 2012, the U.S. Dollar was stronger relative to several foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prior-year period, which had a net negative impact on our 2012 consolidated results of operations. For 2012, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 2% in revenues and operating expenses, which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage. For 2011, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 2% in revenues and operating expenses, which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage.

For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. During the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. For 2012, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the prior-year period. For 2011, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures had a minimal impact on revenue and operating expenses compared to the prior-year period. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. 

The majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs. We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses. In general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions. 

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as “out-of-pocket” expenses. These expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges. We record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results. If it were determined that 

16
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned. Income or expense may also be realized in connection with differences resulting from settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2004 Restatement”). In these situations, or if we release certain of these credit liabilities when the statute of limitations has lapsed, given the historical nature of these liabilities, we generally record such items as other income, net as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change.

We are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings. A valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance. Conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings. In 2012, 2011 and 2010 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of $57.3, $32.9 and $2.4, respectively. 

The authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 11 reporting units that were subject to the 2012 annual impairment testing. During 2012, our reporting unit structure changed due to the creation of a new reporting unit which had been previously included within an existing reporting unit, as well as the disposal of a reporting unit. Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2012 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units. 

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. These assets are impaired 

17
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

In 2011, we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is “more likely than not” less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as pending litigation. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the entity is required to perform the first step of a two-step quantitative impairment test to identify and measure impairment, if necessary. Otherwise, no additional testing is required.

For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed. For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value, excluding goodwill. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.

For both our 2012 and 2011 annual impairment tests, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for nine reporting units and performed the first step of a two-step quantitative impairment test for two reporting units. For the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, macroeconomic conditions and entity-specific factors such as client wins and losses. Based on this assessment, we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment, it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value; therefore, no additional testing was required.

The 2012 and 2011 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.

These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For 2012, the discount rates we used for our reporting units tested were between 13.0% and 14.0%, and the terminal value growth rate for both of our reporting units tested was 3.0%. The terminal value growth rate represents the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy. For 2012, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 2.0% and 4.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

We also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of 

18
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

the range reduces growth rates by 0.25% and increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 0.25% and decreases discount rates by 0.5%. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test. 

The table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the 2012 and 2011 annual impairment tests. For 2012 and 2011, our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range. The table below displays the range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the 2012 and 2011 annual impairment tests. For 2012, using the low of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%. For 2011, using the low-end of the valuation range, there was one reporting unit, with $150.0 of associated goodwill, whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Based on the analysis described above, for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of October 1, 2012, because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. Management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. At December 31, 2012, we determined our discount rates for our domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond yield curve approach. Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate. 

A weighted-average discount rate of 5.00% was used in the calculation of 2012 net pension and postretirement benefit costs for the domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan. A lower discount rate would increase our net pension and postretirement benefit costs. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2012 net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately $1.0.

At December 31, 2012, we used a discount rate of 4.00% for the domestic pension and domestic postretirement benefit plans and a weighted-average discount rate of 4.32% for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2012 benefit obligation by approximately $24.0 and $25.0, respectively. 

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation 

19
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.

For 2012, the weighted-average expected rates of return of 7.25% and 5.02% were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2013, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 7.00% and 5.23% for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. Changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. A lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2012 net pension cost by approximately $1.0.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results of Operations 

REVENUE

Our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. In the events marketing business, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. We generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012, our revenue decreased by $58.4, or 0.8%, compared to 2011, due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $147.6, partially offset by an organic revenue increase of $47.4, or 0.7%, and the effect of net acquisitions of $41.8. Our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to new client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in our international markets. We had strong growth in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Australia, Singapore, India and China, and in the Latin America region, predominantly in Brazil. Also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was an increase in the United Kingdom, predominately due to our events marketing business, which benefited from work performed in connection with the Olympics in the third quarter. The organic revenue increase in our international markets was throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the retail and technology and telecom sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector due to net client losses in the prior year. Our revenue decreased in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Spain and Italy, due to a continued challenging economic climate. This was partially offset by growth in Germany. In our domestic market, our organic revenue decrease was due to net client losses in the prior year, most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors, and a decline in spending from existing clients, primarily in the retail and health care sectors. Partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market was an organic revenue increase in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, our revenue increased by $507.3, or 7.8%, compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $393.7, or 6.1%, and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $122.2. Our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients across all major client sectors and throughout nearly all geographic regions, led by the domestic market. The sectors that primarily contributed to our organic revenue increase were technology and telecom and auto and transportation. In the international markets, the most notable organic revenue increases occurred in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil, in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and India, and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom. The Continental Europe region was essentially flat as results varied by European country due to a challenging economic climate in the region.

 Refer to the segment discussion later in this MD&A for information on changes in revenue by segment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Salaries and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, costs for temporary workers and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards. Additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance. Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. Factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, the change in our stock price, actual results, and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our staff cost ratio, defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, increased in 2012 to 63.1% from 62.8% in 2011. Salaries and related expenses in 2012 decreased by $10.2 compared to 2011, due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $85.6, partially offset by an organic increase of $40.9 and the effect of net acquisitions of $34.5. 

21
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

The organic increase was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $96.4, primarily attributable to increases in our workforce in international regions, most notably in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, and businesses where we had revenue growth, as well as modest wage increases. Our workforce decreased in regions and businesses where we had revenue declines as we have been disciplined in managing our workforce. Partially offsetting this organic increase was a reduction in incentive award expense of $51.1, resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets. 

Our staff cost ratio decreased in 2011 to 62.8% from 63.3% in 2010. Salaries and related expenses in 2011 increased by $285.1 compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $209.1 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $74.9. The organic increase of 5.1% was lower than our organic revenue increase of 6.1% due to our cost discipline during the year. The organic increase was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth, resulting in an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $189.4. Hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011. Also contributing to the organic increase, but to a lesser extent, was higher incentive award expense primarily due to continued improvement in operating results in 2011. The organic increase occurred across all regions, primarily in our domestic market.

The following table details our staff cost ratio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Office and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff, and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our office and general expense ratio, defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, decreased in 2012 to 27.1% from 27.4% in 2011. Office and general expenses in 2012 decreased by $39.3 compared to 2011, due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $40.7 and an organic decrease of $7.0, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of $8.4. The organic decrease was primarily attributable to lower occupancy costs, as we continue to find efficiencies in our real estate portfolio, and professional fees. The organic decrease was partially offset by higher production expenses in our international markets, most notably in the Asia Pacific region and in the United Kingdom, related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2012.

Our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2011 to 27.4% from 28.3% in 2010. Office and general expenses in 2011 increased by $83.7 compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $54.3 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $34.3. The organic increase was primarily attributable to continued business growth in 2011, which resulted in higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2011. Also contributing to the organic increase, but to a lesser extent, was higher discretionary spending to support business growth.

The following table details our office and general expense ratio. All other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses, and, to a lesser extent, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, foreign currency gains (losses), restructuring and other reorganization-related charges (reversals), long-lived asset impairment and other expenses.

EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Interest Expense

For 2012, net interest expense increased by $5.0 as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in non-cash interest expense. Non-cash interest expense increased since the premium associated with our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.25% Notes"), which we retired in March 2012, was fully amortized. Cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 4.25% Notes, which was offset by lower interest income, primarily in the United States due to lower cash balances.

For 2011, net interest expense decreased by $12.0 as compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in interest income. Interest income increased primarily due to an increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances and an increase in average interest rates in certain countries around the world compared to the prior-year period. Interest expense decreased primarily due to repayment of debt obligations in 2010, partially offset by higher interest expense in certain countries outside of the United States.

Other Income, net

Results of operations include certain items that are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of Businesses and Investments – This item primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses and investments, cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our Rabbi Trusts. During 2012, we received net proceeds of $94.8 from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook and recorded a pre-tax gain of $93.6. Additionally, we recognized a gain relating to the sale of a business in an international market within our Constituency Management Group ("CMG") segment, which was partially offset by losses recognized relating to the sale of a business in an international market and the sale of a business in the domestic market within our Integrated Agency Networks ("IAN") segment, as well as an adjustment relating to a reserve for a change in estimate in connection with a business disposed of in a prior year. During 2011, we received net proceeds of $133.5 from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook and recorded a pre-tax gain of $132.2. Additionally, we recognized a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our IAN segment. During 2010, we recognized a gain relating 

23

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our CMG segment, which was partially offset by a loss recognized relating to the sale of one our European businesses within our IAN segment. 

Vendor Discounts and Credit Adjustments – We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the 2004 Restatement. These adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of differences resulting from settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed. 

INCOME TAXES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income. In 2012, our effective income tax rate of 31.6% was positively impacted by the reversals of valuation allowances associated with the Asia Pacific and Continental Europe regions, of $26.2 and $21.8, respectively, as well as by a benefit derived from the deduction of foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment of $19.5 associated with the establishment of a previously unrecorded reserve for a tax contingency for the years 2007 through 2010, losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit. 

On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the "Act") was signed into law and is effective in the first quarter of 2013. The Act contains various provisions which should be beneficial to the Company, and while we continue to assess the current and future impact of this Act, we do not expect it to have a material impact to our effective or cash tax rates in the near future.

In 2011, our effective income tax rate of 25.8% was positively impacted primarily from the utilization of capital losses to offset nearly all of the $132.2 capital gain realized from the Facebook transaction. The capital gain enabled us to use capital loss carryforwards, on which a 100% valuation allowance had been previously established, and capital losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the 2007-2008 IRS audit cycle, a lower effective income tax rate on non-U.S. operations and the net reversal of valuation allowances, primarily in Europe. The effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by state and local taxes and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. The settlement of the 2007-2008 audit cycle resulted in no cash payment.

In 2010, our effective income tax rate of 38.0% was positively impacted by reversals of valuation allowances in Canada and the United Kingdom. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the taxation of foreign operations, which included an income tax assessment in Latin America. During 2010, we effectively settled with the United Kingdom tax authorities for the 2007 and 2008 tax years, which resulted in no cash payment. Also in 2010, we effectively settled our New York State examination for the 1999-2001 tax years. This settlement resulted in a cash payment of $11.7 consisting of $5.4 of tax and $6.3 of interest, which was previously reserved.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Segment Results of Operations 

As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2012: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the "Corporate and other" group. 

IAN

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012, IAN revenue decreased by $163.3 compared to 2011, due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $138.7 and an organic revenue decrease of $44.4, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of $19.8. The organic revenue decrease was attributable to a decline in our domestic market due to net client losses in the prior year, most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors, and a decline in spending from existing clients, primarily in the health care and retail sectors. Partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market were increases in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors. In our international markets, our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Australia and India, and in the Latin America region, predominantly in Brazil. The sectors primarily contributing to the international organic revenue increase were the retail and technology and telecom sectors, which was partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, primarily due to a continued challenging economic climate.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, IAN revenue increased by $423.4 compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $291.8 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $106.9. The increase in revenue at our IAN segment represented approximately 74% of the total organic revenue increase. The organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients in all major client sectors, across our advertising and media businesses and in nearly all geographic regions, led by the domestic market. The sectors which primarily contributed to the organic revenue increase were technology and telecom and, to a lesser extent, auto and transportation. The international organic increase occurred predominantly in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil, and in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in India and China. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, which was impacted by a challenging economic climate in the region.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income decreased during 2012 when compared to 2011 due to a decrease in revenue of $163.3, partially offset by decreases in salaries and related expenses of $69.9 and office and general expenses of $66.5. The decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to a reduction in incentive award expense resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets and, to a lesser extent, lower severance expense. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not occur during 2012, lower occupancy costs and, to a lesser extent, lower professional fees. 

25
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

Operating income increased during 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in revenue of $423.4, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $238.7 and office and general expenses of $71.9. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth, which resulted in an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help across nearly all agencies within IAN. Hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs and, to a lesser extent, higher discretionary spending and higher production expenses due to business growth.

CMG

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012, CMG revenue increased by $104.9 compared to 2011, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $91.8. The organic revenue increase was primarily due to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients across all disciplines, primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses. The international organic revenue increase occurred throughout nearly all regions, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, most notably in Australia, Singapore and China, and in the United Kingdom, where our events marketing business benefited from work performed for the Olympics in the third quarter. Revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects where we act as principal, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to growth in our public relations and sports marketing businesses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, CMG revenue increased by $83.9 compared to 2010, due to an organic revenue increase of $101.9 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $15.3, partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of $33.3. The organic revenue increase was primarily due to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins which occurred in most disciplines, primarily in our public relations and events marketing businesses, in both our domestic and international markets. The international organic revenue increase was most significant in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and Australia, and in the United Kingdom. The organic revenue increase includes higher revenue related to certain projects where we act as principal, primarily in our events marketing business. The reduction in revenue due to net divestitures primarily relates to the sale of a business in our domestic market in the fourth quarter of 2010.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating income increased during 2012 when compared to 2011 due to an increase in revenue of $104.9, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $51.2 and office and general expenses of $40.4. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce across all disciplines to support business growth, which resulted in an increase in base salaries and benefits. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2012.

26
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

Operating income increased during 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in revenue of $83.9, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $35.6 and office and general expenses of $25.9. Salaries and related expenses increased across all disciplines primarily due to business growth, which resulted in an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses associated with business growth. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses, shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition, office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. 

Corporate and other expenses decreased during 2012 by $4.7 to $137.3 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower office and general expenses, partially offset by an increase in temporary help to support our information-technology system-upgrade initiatives.

Corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during 2011 by $3.3 to $142.0 compared to 2010, primarily due to lower occupancy costs, partially offset by an increase in temporary help and severance expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of an investment.

2 Reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2012 was $357.2, which is an increase of $83.7 as compared to 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in working capital usage of $66.2. The net working capital usage in 2012 was primarily impacted by our media businesses. 

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was $273.5, which was a decrease of $543.8 as compared to 2010, primarily as a result of a use of cash from working capital in 2011 of $359.4 as compared to a generation of cash in 2010 of $263.2. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year, with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we had significant cash generation from working capital, primarily due to a high rate of growth in our media businesses, which resulted in comparable working capital usage in the first quarter of 2011. Our net working capital usage in 2011 was also impacted by slower growth in those same businesses compared to the prior year.

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. 

Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by the net proceeds of $94.8 received from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook. Capital expenditures of $169.2 relate primarily to computer software and hardware, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures increased in 2012 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year. Payments for acquisitions of $145.5 primarily relate to payments for new acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by the net proceeds of $133.5 received from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook. Capital expenditures of $140.3 relate primarily to computer software and hardware, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures increased in 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year. Payments for acquisitions of $63.1 relate to new acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during 2012 primarily reflects net proceeds from our debt transactions. We issued $300.0 in aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2.25% Notes"), $500.0 in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "3.75% Notes") and $250.0 in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "4.00% Notes"). The proceeds from the issuance of the 4.00% Notes were applied towards the repurchase and redemption of $399.6 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Notes. We intend to apply the net proceeds from the sale of the 2.25% and 3.75% Notes towards the redemption of our $200.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.75% Notes") and our $600.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 10.00% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "10.00% Notes"). Offsetting the net proceeds from our debt transactions was the repurchase of 32.7 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $350.5, including fees, and dividend payments of $103.4 on our common stock. 

Net cash used in financing activities during 2011 primarily relates to the repurchase of 41.7 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $400.8, including fees. Additionally, net cash used in financing activities includes dividend payments of $111.1 on our common stock and acquisition-related payments of $71.5, for equity transactions in consolidated subsidiaries where we increased our ownership interests. 

Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of $6.2 in 2012. The decrease was a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Brazilian Real and South African Rand, offset by the U.S. Dollar being weaker than other foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, as of December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011.

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of $46.7 in 2011. The decrease was a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Euro and Brazilian Real, as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK

We expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We also have a committed corporate credit facility available to support our operating needs. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends. 

From time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

Funding Requirements 

Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, taxes, debt service and contributions to pension and postretirement plans. Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests.

Notable funding requirements include: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Acquisitions – We paid cash of $142.0, which was net of cash acquired of $14.8, for acquisitions completed in 2012. We also paid cash of $43.8 related to prior year acquisitions, of which $3.2 was charged as operating expense. In addition to potential cash expenditures for new acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately $26.0 in 2013 related to prior-year acquisitions. We may also be required to pay approximately $15.0 in 2013 related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and to increase our ownership interests in current investments, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets.

Share Repurchase Program

In February 2011, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2011 share repurchase program"). In August 2011, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2011 share repurchase program up to $450.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, as a result of the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook.In February 2012, our Board authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2012 share repurchase program"). In November 2012, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2012 share repurchase program up to $400.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, as a result of the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook. On February 22, 2013, we announced that our Board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. The new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the 2012 share repurchase program. We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means. We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods, although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. Any repurchases pursuant to our exercise of our capped call options will not count against the limits established under our share repurchase programs. See "--Financing and Sources of Funds--Capped Call" below. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2012, $100.0 remains available for repurchase under the 2012 share repurchase program. We completed the 2011 share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2012.

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries. Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. These letters of credit historically have not been drawn upon.

At December 31, 2012, we held $883.5 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries. We have not provided U.S. federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. If in the future we distribute these amounts to the United States, an additional provision for the U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, net of foreign tax credits, could be necessary.

Credit Facilities

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility expiring May 31, 2016, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,000.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $200.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. We use our Credit Agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries.

The Credit Agreement includes covenants that, among other things, limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limit subsidiary debt. The financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require that we maintain, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, certain financial measures for the four quarters then ended. In November 2012, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement, which modified the definition of “Total Debt” in the Credit Agreement to disregard until August 15, 2013 the $300.0 in aggregate principal amount of the 2.25% Notes and the $500.0 in aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Notes that we issued in November 2012, subject to the reduction of this disregarded amount by the amount of any reductions in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 4.75% Notes or the 10.00% Notes. As a result of this amendment, these notes will have no impact on our financial covenants in the Credit Agreement until August 15, 2013.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

The table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of December 31, 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 EBITDA is calculated as defined in the Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement. If we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. If we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility. 

We also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the United States. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively.

Capped Call

In November 2010, we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 4.75% Notes are convertible. The strike price and cap price related to the capped call options are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012 and 2011, the strike price and cap price related to the capped call options were adjusted due to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, the options give us the right to purchase up to 16.9 shares of our common stock at the strike price, except that the net proceeds of exercising the options will not exceed the difference between $17.43 and $11.86. Subject to certain limitations, we may elect settlement of the options to occur in cash or in shares. The options will expire on April 2, 2013. Our capped call transaction meets the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement per Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).

Cash Pooling 

We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts on the net balance for all the agencies up to an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 the amounts netted were $1,166.3 and $1,106.6, respectively.

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 13, 2013 are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We are investment-grade rated by both Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings. The most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in February 2012, when Standard & Poor's placed our credit rating on positive credit watch. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, including, among other things, because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise. For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2012 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.
