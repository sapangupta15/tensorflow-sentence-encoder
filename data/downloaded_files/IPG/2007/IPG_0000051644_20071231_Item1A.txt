Item 1A.    Risk Factors    

 We are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. Some of these risks relate to the industry in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. The following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also impair our business operations or financial condition. See also Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure.  

       Ongoing SEC investigations regarding our accounting restatements could adversely affect us.    

 Since January 2003 the SEC has been conducting a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in August 2002, and in 2005 the investigation expanded to encompass the restatement we presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in September 2005. We have also responded to inquiries from the SEC staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but as settlement discussions have not yet commenced, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters.  

 The SEC staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from the Commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or, failing a settlement, to litigate an action charging the Company with various violations of the federal securities laws. In that connection, and as previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed June 14, 2007, the staff sent us a Wells notice, which invited us to make a responsive submission before the staff makes a final determination concerning its recommendation to the Commission. We expect to discuss settlement with the staff once the Commission authorizes the staff to engage in such discussions. We cannot at this time predict what the Commission will authorize or the outcome of any settlement negotiations.  

       We operate in a highly competitive industry.    

 The marketing communications business is highly competitive. Our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative or media services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets. New market participants include systems integrators, database marketing and modeling companies, telemarketers and internet companies.  

 The clients perception of the quality of an agencys creative work, our reputation and the agencies reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position. An agencys ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration. On the other hand, because an agencys principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a clients account from a much larger competitor.  

 8   
 Many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. We have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26% of revenue in 2007. While we believe it unlikely that we would lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time, a substantial decline in such a clients advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of its entire business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.  

 Our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. These policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies.  

       We may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel.    

 Employees, including creative, research, media, account and practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most important assets. An important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. Our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our recent financial or market performance.  

       As a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.    

 Economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing services industry than other industries. In the past, some clients have responded to weak economic performance in any region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. This pattern may recur in the future.  

       Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.    

 Our long-term debt is currently rated Ba3 with stable outlook by Moodys, B with positive outlook by Standard and Poors, and BB- with stable outlook by Fitch. Any ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. Our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.  

       Our liquidity profile could be adversely affected.    

 In previous years, we have experienced operating losses and weak operating cash flow. Until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we were unable to do so, our liquidity position could be adversely affected.  

       If some of our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results.    

 We have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. If any client with whom we have a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize the collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. For a description of our client base, see Item 1, Business  Clients.

       International business risks could adversely affect our operations.    

 International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 44% in 2007. Our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions. These risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. In addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, such as the Euro, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen and South African Rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results.  

       In 2006 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may be required to record additional charges in the future related to these matters.    

 We evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability. If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. In the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill, investment and other impairment charges, and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards.  

 As of December 31, 2007, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future events, including our financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired. Any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized.  

       We may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones.    

 From time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue and operating margin growth. These targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance, but they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. Our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. See Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure.  

        We are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues.    

 Our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. There has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. Through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. Representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues.
