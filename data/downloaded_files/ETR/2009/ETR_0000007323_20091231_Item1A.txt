RISK FACTORS 

Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See "FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION." 

Utility Regulatory Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas and System Energy) 

The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 

The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance charges, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. 

In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs), allowed rates of return and appropriate rate base, proposed resource acquisitions and previously incurred capital expenditures. The regulators can disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited by statute, which could cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering such costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, which could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

The Utility operating companies recover fuel and purchased power costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 

The Utility operating companies recover their fuel and purchased power costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies. 

The Utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities has been changed by the FERC, which will require adjustment of retail rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process. 

The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005, the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule. In 2007 through 2009, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies.  Although actual payments/receipts for 2010, based on calendar year 2009 production costs, will not be calculated until the Utility operating companies have filed their FERC Form 1s, preliminary estimates indicate that Entergy Arkansas will be required to make payments of approximately $70 million in 2010. Entergy's management believes that any changes in the allocation of production costs resulting from the FERC's decision and related retail proceedings should result in similar rate changes for retail customers. The timing of recovery of these costs in rates, however, could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. 

In December 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided notice of its intent to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. In November 2007, Entergy Mississippi provided its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. Each notice of termination is effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. The FERC accepted the notices in November 2009; the LPSC and City Council have requested rehearing of that order. Entergy cannot predict the timing or the form of any successor arrangement to the System Agreement, to the extent one is implemented, or the effect such a successor arrangement (or the absence thereof) will have on Entergy or the Utility operating companies. 

The LPSC, APSC, MPSC and the AEEC have appealed the 2005 FERC decision to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Entergy and the City of New Orleans intervened in the various appeals. The D.C. Circuit issued its decision in April 2008. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the FERC's decision in most respects, but remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings and reconsideration of its conclusion that it was prohibited from ordering refunds and its determination to implement the bandwidth remedy commencing with calendar year 2006 production costs (with the first payments/receipts commencing in June 2007), rather than commencing the remedy on June 1, 2005. The D.C. Circuit concluded the FERC had failed to offer a reasoned explanation regarding these issues. The proceeding is pending at the FERC. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see the "Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation - System Agreement Proceedings" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. See "Fuel and purchased power cost recovery, Entergy Texas," in Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of a PUCT decision that Entergy Texas is currently challenging regarding its rough production cost equalization receipts that could result in $18.6 million of trapped costs between Entergy's Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. The outcome and timing of the FERC and these other proceedings and appeals cannot be predicted at this time.

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred, as a result of severe weather could have material adverse effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 

Entergy's and its Utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity and financial condition can be materially adversely affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material adverse effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

 Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect certain Utility operating companies', System Energy's and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries' results of operations. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs, as well as non-fixed costs associated with plant operating conditions and issues. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. Lower capacity factors increase operating costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil or hydroelectric facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. Although most of the Non-Utility Nuclear forward sales are on a pure unit-contingent basis, which depends on the availability of the asset, some of the unit-contingent contracts guarantee a specific capacity factor. Non-Utility Nuclear forward sales can also be on a Firm LD basis. In the event these plants were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, the unit-contingent contracts carrying damage provisions would subject the Entergy System to price risk for the undelivered power. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries periodically shutdown their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such fuel outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 

Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be "turned off." Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and have historically averaged approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs increase. The Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries may face lower margins due to higher costs and lower energy sales for unit-contingent power supply contracts or potentially higher energy replacement costs for unit-contingent contracts with capacity guarantees that are not met due to extended or unplanned outages. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), and their inability to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2010. It will be necessary for Entergy to enter into additional arrangements to acquire nuclear fuel and related services beyond 2010. Entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices depends upon the creditworthiness and performance reliability of uranium miners, as well as upon the structure of Entergy's contracts for the purchase of nuclear fuel. For example, some of the supply under Entergy's contracts for nuclear fuel is effectively on a "mine-contingent" basis, which means that if applicable mines are unable to supply sufficient uranium, Entergy may be required to purchase some nuclear fuel from another supplier. There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate such an event, including potentially drawing upon Entergy's own inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. The market for uranium supply became extremely limited in 2006 and 2007, but this supply shortfall was substantially eliminated in 2008 and 2009. Market prices for uranium concentrates rose from about $7 per pound in December 2000 to a 2007 range of $70 to $135 per pound. In 2008, however, market prices for uranium concentrates ranged from $45 to $90 per pound and from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 ranged from $40 to $55 per pound. The recent higher nuclear fuel market prices of 2006-2009 compared to the 2000-2005 period affect the U.S. nuclear utility industry, including Entergy, first in cash flow requirements for fuel acquisition, and then, some time later, in nuclear fuel expenses. For example, for a nuclear fleet the size of Entergy's, the current market value of annual enriched

uranium requirements has increased by several hundred million dollars compared to about five years ago. As nuclear fuel installed in the core in nuclear power plants is replaced fractionally over an approximate five-year period, nuclear fuel expense is beginning to, and will eventually with a time lag, reflect current market prices and can be expected to increase from the previously reported industry levels of about 0.5 cents per kWh to closer to 1.0 cent per kWh. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio has provided a degree of price hedging against the full extent of market prices through 2010, but market trends will eventually affect the costs of all nuclear plant operators. Entergy is dependent on the continued performance by suppliers of their obligations under their long-term agreements and Entergy’s ability to manage these risks by purchasing uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries. Entergy’s financial results could be materially adversely affected if Entergy is unable to successfully manage these risks and any one major supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and Entergy is unable to find other suppliers that can perform under terms that allow Entergy to achieve the same level of profitability. As a result of the failure of a major supplier to meet its contractual obligations or Entergy’s ability to manage such a risk, Entergy may face higher costs to secure other suppliers, which may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries face the risk that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity or financial condition of Entergy (through its ownership of the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries), its Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit –whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not - it could materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries. 

A failure to obtain renewed licenses for the continued operation of Entergy’s nuclear power plants could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's operations and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 

The license renewal and related processes for Entergy's nuclear power plants has been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The operating licenses for Vermont Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015. Various parties have expressed opposition to the pending license renewal applications. There is an ongoing proceeding before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the NRC and contentions have been admitted for litigation regarding the Indian Point license renewals. The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board has completed its proceedings regarding 

243

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Vermont Yankee, but the New England Coalition filed a petition for NRC review of the Atomic Safety Licensing Board’s decision on July 23, 2009. Finally, with respect to the Pilgrim license renewal, the NRC has issued decisions resolving most of the issues that were previously on appeal, but the NRC has asked for further briefing regarding one final issue, which could later be referred back for further proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. In addition, a group of environmental and civic organizations has filed a petition with the NRC seeking a suspension of the currently pending license renewal proceedings for Indian Point, Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee. 

In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian Point must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. Indian Point also must obtain a Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination from the New York Department of State prior to getting its renewed license. 

In addition to the NRC license renewal process with respect to Vermont Yankee, under Vermont law the Vermont Public Service Board will need to amend the certificate of public good held by Entergy Vermont Yankee, LLC and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., which also requires Vermont legislative approval, and the Vermont Public Service Board and the Vermont legislature must approve and the Vermont Public Service Board must issue a certificate of public good for the continued operation of Vermont Yankee and storing of spent fuel generated in Vermont after March 21, 2012. An application has been filed with the Vermont Public Service Board (as required by Vermont law) for approval of continued operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after that date. During its 2009 session, which concluded in May, several committees of the Vermont General Assembly held hearings on Vermont Yankee, but no bill or resolution was introduced for approval of continued operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21, 2012. In January 2010, the Governor of the State of Vermont issued a statement indicating he would not ask the Vermont General Assembly to consider the Vermont Yankee license renewal during its 2010 session, based on the discovery of tritium leakage from Vermont Yankee, concerns about miscommunication by Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations related to underground piping at Vermont Yankee carrying radionuclides, and other issues including decommissioning. Notwithstanding the Governor's position, on February 24, 2010, a bill to approve the continued operation of Vermont Yankee was advanced to a vote by the Vermont Senate leadership and defeated by a margin of 26 to 4. This vote does not preclude the Vermont Senate from voting again on a similar bill in the future.  

If the NRC does not renew the operating licenses for one or more of Entergy's nuclear power plants, or the states in which Entergy’s nuclear power plants are located do not otherwise take the necessary actions for the continued operation of these plants, to the extent applicable, Entergy’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by loss of revenue associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their aging nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require significant capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy.

The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries incur costs on an annual basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a national repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has cut the budget for the Yucca Mountain project, and has made various statements that Yucca Mountain will not be the solution for spent fuel storage. These actions are likely to prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at its nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage and will be subject to the costs of transportation to a permanent storage facility. In addition, the availability of a repository for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  

Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The consequences of an accident can be severe and include personal injury, loss of life and property damage. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $117.5 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $12.2 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy's Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Non-Utility Nuclear plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $117.5 million per reactor per incident (Entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.3 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $17.5 million per year per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $117.5 million cap. Nuclear accident damage to on-site facilities is covered by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited up to the limits of the primary and excess property policies in force at the time of the accident. As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in these mandatory industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed any of the Utility operating companies', System Energy's, or the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries' primary insurance coverage, and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 

Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to Entergy. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, Entergy also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental ecommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, Non-Utility Nuclear assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, Non-Utility Nuclear will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. Non-Utility Nuclear expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance for this obligation to the NRC. 

In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy’s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants. In June 2009, the NRC issued letters indicating that the NRC staff had concluded that there were shortfalls in the amount of decommissioning funding assurance provided for Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, Waterford 3, and River Bend. The NRC staff subsequently conducted a telephone conference with Entergy on this issue and, in August 2009, Entergy submitted a plan for addressing the identified shortfalls. In its submittal, Entergy provided updated analyses to the NRC indicating that there was no current shortfall in the amounts of the required decommissioning funding assurance for Palisades and Indian Point 2, based upon the trust fund balances as of July 31, 2009 and an analysis of the costs that would be incurred if Entergy elected to use a sixty-year period of safe storage for decommissioning, as permitted by the NRC's rules. In December 2009 the NRC accepted the analyses regarding Palisades and Indian Point and, with respect to each plant, the NRC concluded that no further action was required. For Vermont Yankee, Entergy concluded that, when using the July 31, 2009 trust fund balance, and based on an analysis of the costs that would be incurred if Entergy elected to use a sixty year period of safe storage for decommissioning as permitted by the NRC’s rules, there was a shortfall of approximately $58 million, which could be satisfied with a cash contribution to a decommissioning trust of approximately $51 million, or by using another financial assurance mechanism in the amount of approximately $58 million. In September 2009, the NRC requested further information regarding plans to address the shortfall in decommissioning funding assurance for Vermont Yankee, which Entergy provided in October 2009. Based on the trust fund balance as of September 30, 2009, the shortfall had decreased from $58 million to $40 million. This $40 million shortfall was satisfied with a $40 million guarantee from Entergy Corporation that was effective as of December 31, 2009. For Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy made the appropriate filings by December 31, 2009 with its retail regulators that request decommissioning funding from ratepayers to address the shortfalls identified by the NRC. 

An early plant shutdown, poor investment results (depending on the performance of and volatility in the capital markets) or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements.

New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy’s nuclear power plants. 

New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Non-Utility Nuclear generating units are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shut-down of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, municipalization of nuclear units, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

(Entergy Corporation) 

The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date or if current regulatory requirements change which then could require additional funding.  

Under Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations, Entergy is permitted to project the Nuclear Regulatory Commission-required decommissioning amount based on a Nuclear Regulatory Commission formula and the amount in each of its Non-Utility Nuclear nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts. The projections are made based on the scheduled shutdown date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process for each of these nuclear power plants, with the earliest scheduled shutdown being Vermont Yankee in 2012. As a result, if the projected amount of our decommissioning trusts exceeds the projected Nuclear Regulatory Commission-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations. In the event the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's formula does not sufficiently reflect the actual costs Entergy would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the formula. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may also require that separate financial assurances be provided as part of a plan for the funding of spent fuel management costs. In addition to Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements, certain of the states in which Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear nuclear power plants are located have imposed other decommissioning related obligations, which Entergy believes it will be able to satisfy. 

With respect to the decommissioning trusts for Vermont Yankee, Indian Point 2 and Palisades, the total amount in each of those trusts as of December 31, 2009 would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term decommissioning of the respective unit as of such date, but rather the funds would have been sufficient to place the unit in a condition of safe storage status pending future completion of decommissioning. For example, if Entergy had decided to shutdown and immediately begin decommissioning one of those nuclear power plants on December 31, 2009, its trust funds for the plant would have been insufficient and Entergy would have been required to rely on other capital resources to fund the entire decommissioning obligations unless the completion of decommissioning could be deferred during some number of years of safe storage status. Thus, if Entergy decides to shutdown one of these nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date, Entergy may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. 

Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of its Non-Utility Nuclear nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The nuclear power plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business will be exposed to price risk to the extent they must compete for the advance sale of energy and capacity or accept spot prices in the day-ahead markets. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility regulated businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. As of December 31, 2009, the nuclear power generation plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business had sold forward 88%, 74%, 32%, 18% and 17% of its generation portfolio's planned energy output for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Many of Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business’s existing long-term contracts expire by the end of 2012. The obligations under most of these agreements are contingent on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. In addition, for those obligations that are not unit-contingent, the unit owner will be required to pay the purchaser the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial. 

Market prices may fluctuate substantially sometimes over relatively short periods of time and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 

The price that different counterparties offer for forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Non-Utility Nuclear's contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which could significantly affect Non-Utility Nuclear's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy's control to a significant degree, are: 

  ·    prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;    

  ·    seasonality;    

  ·    availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;    

  ·    changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil and refined products;    

  ·    liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy’s full hedging term;    

  ·    the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;    

  ·    transmission or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;    

  ·    the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by regional economic conditions;    

  ·    weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;    

  ·    the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions and the implementation of conservation programs;    

248

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

  ·    regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;    

  ·    increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Non-Utility Nuclear competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear markets;    

  ·    union and labor relations;    

  ·    changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); and    

  ·    natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.    

Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 

Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Non-Utility Nuclear business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the Non-Utility Nuclear business's nuclear power plants, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC’s orders that grant the Non-Utility Nuclear business's generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Non-Utility Nuclear business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Non-Utility Nuclear business's market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Non-Utility Nuclear business's generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Non-Utility Nuclear business charges for power from its facilities. 

The Non-Utility Nuclear business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Non-Utility Nuclear business's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. 

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Non-Utility Nuclear business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. 

249

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued or delayed, the Non-Utility Nuclear business's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 

General Business Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 

Entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies. In addition, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy's service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 

The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the fourth quarter of 2008 and much of 2009. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 

A downgrade in Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments or repay certain indebtedness. 

250 

Part I

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including the ability to cover liquidity requirements, the availability of committed external credit support, and Entergy Corporation's share repurchase program, dividend policy and other commitments for capital. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation's, any of the Utility operating companies', or System Entergy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit quality collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases and other agreements. 

Most of Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had $369 million of collateral in place to support Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing transactional activity, consisting primarily of Entergy Corporation guarantees, but also including $20 million of guarantees that support letters of credit and $2 million of cash collateral. As of December 31, 2009, the credit exposure associated with Non-Utility Nuclear assurance requirements could increase by an estimated amount of up to $308 million for each $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets, but because market prices have fallen below most contract prices, the credit exposure would increase by only $8 million. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2009, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $73 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. The amount of Entergy Corporation guarantees Entergy would be required to replace will fluctuate depending on changes in power prices. 

The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial conditions, results of operations or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially adversely affected. 

Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies' service territory, see the "Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 

The Utility operating companies, System Energy and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to reliability standards, environmental, and other matters. 

The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business manage air emissions, discharges to water, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered 

251

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, and other regulated air contaminants from fossil-fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes. Risks relating to global climate change and initiatives to compel CO2 emission reductions are discussed below. 

Entergy's business is also subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the SERC Reliability Corporation, are approved by the FERC and currently are being reviewed and amended. Significant capital expenditures for the Utility operating companies' transmission system could be required to achieve on-going compliance with the requirements under these regimes, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of applicable standards. The laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. The changes to the reliability requirements applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the changing reliability requirements will have on its business.  

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "Regulation of Entergy's Business – Environmental Regulation" section of Part I Item 1. 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

The effects of weather and economic conditions and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially adversely affect the Utility operating companies' results of operations. 

Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

252 

Part I

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Industrial sales volume was depressed in the latter part of 2008 and through most of 2009, in part because the overall economy declined, with lower usage across the industrial sector affecting both the large customer industrial segment as well as small and mid-sized industrial customers. Despite the apparently improving economic conditions in the service territories of the Utility operating companies in the fourth quarter of 2009, it is possible that continued or recurrent poor economic conditions, combined with increasing rates in certain of the Utility operating companies' service territories, could result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense relative to recent years, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel CO2 emission reductions could materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. 

In an effort to address climate change concerns, Federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Developing and implementing plans for compliance with CO2 emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" could make some of Entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. In addition, several lawsuits currently are pending against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation and punitive damages. 

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy owns assets in, and serves, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. 

These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

253 

Part I

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

To manage their near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, weather positions, fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas, uranium (and its conversion), lignite, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially adversely affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position. 

Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations or financial position. 

Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or Letter of Credit quality collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position. 

The Utility operating companies and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially adversely affect the Utility operating companies' and Non-Utility Nuclear's business. 

Entergy's Utility operating companies' and its Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries' hedging and risk management activities are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries might be forced to act on the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements or draw on the credit support provided by the counterparties, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 

New legislation may subject the Utility operating companies and Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business to governmental regulation of energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions, which may materially adversely affect the Utility operating companies’ and Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business. 

New legislation may subject the Utility operating companies and Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business to governmental regulation relating to certain hedging transactions. For example, Congress is considering legislation to impose restrictions on the use of over-the-counter derivatives, including energy derivatives. The United States House of Representatives passed its version of the legislation (H.R. 4173, Title III) on December 11, 2009. If such legislation becomes law, Entergy’s subsidiaries could potentially face higher costs to hedge their risks, fewer potential counterparties still active in the newly regulated marketplace, and increased liquidity requirements. Under the proposed legislation, hedging and other risk management transactions conducted by the Utility operating companies and Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business would be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If such legislation were to become law without the addition of appropriate exemptions for energy transactions and energy markets, then Entergy believes that the forward hedging strategies and other risk management activities of its subsidiaries could either be curtailed or become significantly more expensive. A substantial number of these hedge transactions currently used by Entergy’s subsidiaries rely upon bilaterally negotiated contracts that are unsecured or utilize corporate guarantees or fixed credit support 

254 

Part I

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

structures. If Entergy’s subsidiaries were to be required to “clear” their transactions, or to post margin based on the mark-to-market forward price of power (as margin is calculated by Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated exchanges and clearing entities), then these subsidiaries would need to arrange a substantial amount of additional liquidity in order to maintain their current level of hedging and risk management activities. 

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding. 

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy's benefit plan liabilities. The recent significant volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. Guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy's pension contributions in the future. For further information regarding Entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reference is made to the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. States in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 

Terrorist attacks, future war or risk of war may adversely affect Entergy's results of operations. 

As power generators, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act of terrorism, either as a direct act against one of Entergy's generation facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power which affects its ability to operate. If such an attack were to occur, Entergy's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of terrorist attacks also may cause Entergy to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel. 

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy's, the Utility operating companies' and System Energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the

benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in Federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy's, the Utility operating companies' and System Energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy's accounting for tax obligations, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements. 

(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) 

The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's and Entergy New Orleans' results of operations and liquidity. 

Gas rates charged to customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted quarterly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's or Entergy New Orleans' cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans. 

(System Energy) 

System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 

System Energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy and are payable on a full cost-of-service basis only so long as Grand Gulf remains in commercial operation. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies' support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the "Grand Gulf - Related Agreements" section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the "Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements" section of Part I Item 1. 

(Entergy Corporation) 

Entergy Corporation's holding company structure could limit its ability to pay dividends. 

Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, reference is made to the "COMMON EQUITY – Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions" section of Note 7 to the financial statements. 

Entergy Corporation's proposed spin-off of its Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to risks inherent to a large-scale transaction subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of complex financings. 

256 

Part I

 Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

The proposed spin-off of Entergy Corporation's Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to multiple risks and uncertainties, including the risk that the spin-off will not be consummated, the risk that the financing transactions contemplated as part of the spin-off cannot be consummated on terms and conditions acceptable to Entergy Corporation or the risk that state and Federal regulatory jurisdictions may impose conditions to the transaction not acceptable to Entergy Corporation. If the spin-off is consummated, it is possible that Entergy Corporation or Enexus Energy Corporation, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy whose shares will be distributed in the spin-off , may not achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they expect will result from the transaction or that such benefits may be delayed or not occur due to unforeseen changes in market and economic conditions or other events. As a result, the aggregate market price of the common stock of Entergy Corporation and Enexus Energy Corporation as separate companies could be less than the market price of Entergy Corporation's common stock if the spin-off had not occurred.

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $19.7 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower net revenue, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher nuclear refueling outage expenses, and higher interest expense. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income decreased $92.0 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher net revenue. The higher other operation and maintenance expenses resulted primarily from the write-off of approximately $70.8 million of costs as a result of the December 2008 Arkansas Court of Appeals decision in Entergy Arkansas' 2006 base rate case. The 2006 base rate case is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Net Revenue 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The provision for regulatory proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather and an 11.6% volume decrease in industrial sales primarily in the mid to small customer class. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to the recovery of 2008 extraordinary storm costs as approved by the APSC, effective January 2009, which is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. Also contributing to the increase are increases in the capacity acquisition rider related to the Ouachita acquisition. The net income effect of the Ouachita cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Ouachita plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $119.9 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales;    

  ·    a decrease of $63.2 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to a change in the energy cost recovery rider effective April 2009 and decreased usage; and    

  ·    a decrease of $24.4 million related to volume/weather, as discussed above.    

 The decrease was offset by an increase of $90.7 million in rider revenues. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market price of purchased power. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2008 to 2007. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The rider revenue variance is primarily due to an Energy Efficiency rider which became effective in November 2007. The establishment of the rider results in an increase in rider revenue and a corresponding increase in other operation and maintenance expense with no effect on net income. Also contributing to the variance was an increase in franchise tax rider revenue as a result of higher retail revenues. The corresponding increase is in taxes other than income taxes, resulting in no effect on net income. 

The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to lower reserve equalization expenses. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales during the billed and unbilled sales periods compared to 2007 and a 2.9% volume decrease in industrial sales, primarily in the wood industry and the small customer class. Billed electricity usage decreased 333 GWh in all sectors. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for unbilled revenues. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $114 million in gross wholesale revenue due to an increase in the average price of energy available for resale sales and an increase in sales to affiliated customers;    

  ·    an increase of $106.1 million in production cost allocation rider revenues which became effective in July 2007 as a result of the System Agreement proceedings. As a result of the System Agreement proceedings, Entergy Arkansas also has a corresponding increase in deferred fuel expense for payments to other Entergy system companies such that there is no effect on net income. Entergy Arkansas makes payments over a seven-month period but collections from customers occur over a twelve-month period. The production cost allocation rider is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements and the System Agreement proceedings are referenced below under "Federal Regulation"; and    

259 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    an increase of $58.9 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to changes in the energy cost recovery rider effective April 2008 and September 2008, partially offset by decreased usage. The energy cost recovery rider filings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.    

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million related to volume/weather, as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $106.1 million in deferred System Agreement payments, as discussed above and an increase in the average market price of purchased power. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Nuclear refueling outage expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with the planned maintenance and refueling outage at ANO 1 which ended in December 2008 and the planned maintenance and refueling outage at ANO 2 which ended in September 2009. 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  ·    the capitalization in 2009 of $12.5 million of Ouachita service charges previously expensed in 2008;    

  ·    prior year storm damage charges as a result of several storms hitting Entergy Arkansas' service territory in 2008, including Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in the third quarter 2008. Entergy Arkansas discontinued regulatory storm reserve accounting beginning July 2007 as a result of the APSC order issued in Entergy Arkansas' rate case. As a result, non-capital storm expenses of $41 million were charged to other operation and maintenance expenses. In December 2008, $19.4 million of these storm expenses were deferred per an APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009; and    

  ·    a decrease of $10.8 million in payroll-related and benefits costs.    

The decrease was partially offset by the following: 

  ·    an increase of $17.9 million due to higher fossil costs primarily due to a full year of Ouachita costs in 2009 and higher fossil plant outage costs in 2009;    

  ·    an increase of $14.4 million due to the reinstatement of storm reserve accounting effective January 2009;    

  ·    an increase of $9.6 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to increased nuclear labor and contract costs;    

  ·    an increase in legal expenses as a result of a reimbursement in April 2008 of $7 million of costs in connection with a litigation settlement; and    

  ·    an increase of $4.0 million in customer service costs primarily as a result of write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts.    

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding as a result of the issuance of $300 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2008. 

260 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    the write-off in the fourth quarter 2008 of $52 million of costs previously accumulated in Entergy Arkansas's storm reserve and $16 million of removal costs associated with the termination of a lease, both in connection with the December 2008 Arkansas Court of Appeals decision in Entergy Arkansas's 2006 base rate case. The 2006 base rate case is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial statements;    

  ·    an increase of $16.8 million in fossil plant expenses due to the Ouachita plant acquisition in 2008; and    

  ·    an increase of $15 million in storm damage charges as a result of several storms hitting Entergy Arkansas' service territory in 2008, including Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in the third quarter 2008. Entergy Arkansas discontinued regulatory storm reserve accounting beginning July 2007 as a result of the APSC order issued in Entergy Arkansas' 2006 base rate case. As a result, non-capital storm expenses of $41 million were charged to other operation and maintenance expenses. In December 2008, $19.4 million of these storm expenses were deferred per an APSC order and will be recovered through revenues in 2009. See Note 2 for discussion of the APSC order.    

The increase was partially offset by: 

  ·    a decrease of $8.9 million in payroll-related and benefits costs;    

  ·    a decrease of $8.3 million related to expenses in connection with the nuclear fleet alignment in 2007, which is discussed in more detail in Note 13 to the financial statements; and    

  ·    a reimbursement of $7 million of costs in connection with a litigation settlement.    

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher residential and commercial revenue and an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher millage rate and a higher 2008 assessment. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 55.0%, 67.2%, and 38.1%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

261 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Activities 

Cash flow from operations decreased $76.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to income tax payments of $1.4 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $57.9 million in 2008 and an increase in storm spending in 2009, partially offset by a decrease of $14.1 million in pension contributions. 

Cash flow from operations increased $94.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to income tax refunds of $57.9 million in 2008 compared to income tax payments of $21.9 million in 2007 and an increase in recovery of fuel costs, partially offset by storm restoration spending. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $327.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the purchase of the Ouachita plant for $210 million in September 2008 and the sale of one-third of the plant for $75 million in 2009, decreases in nuclear construction expenditures resulting from various nuclear projects that occurred in 2008, and decreases in distribution and transmission construction expenditures resulting from Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in distribution construction expenditures as a result of an ice storm hitting Entergy Arkansas' service territory in the first quarter 2009. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $318.4 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to: 

  ·    the purchase of the Ouachita plant for $210 million in September 2008. See Note 15 to the financial statements for more details on the acquisition;    

  ·    an increase in nuclear construction expenditures resulting from various nuclear projects in 2008;    

  ·    an increase in distribution and transmission construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike, as well as several storms hitting Entergy Arkansas' service territory in the first quarter of 2008; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Increases in Entergy Arkansas' receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas' receivable from the money pool increased by $16 million in 2008 compared to decreasing by $14.3 million in 2007. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy's subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Arkansas' financing activities used $56.0 million of cash in 2009 compared to providing $187.6 million in 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    issuance of $300 million of 5.4% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2008;    

  ·    an increase of $23.4 million in common stock dividends paid in 2009; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas' payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas' payable to the money pool decreased by $77.9 million in 2008. 

Entergy Arkansas' financing activities provided $187.6 million of cash in 2008 compared to using $110.6 million in 2007 primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.40% Series First Mortgage Bonds in July 2008 and a decrease of $156.7 million in common stock dividends paid in 2008, partially offset by money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas' payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas' payable to the money pool decreased by $77.9 million in 2008 compared to increasing by $77.9 million in 2007. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. 

262 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Arkansas' capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and shareholders' equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas' financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred stock maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas' planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $193 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.  

  (4)   It is expected that additional financing under the leases will be arranged as needed to acquire additional fuel, to pay interest, and to pay maturing debt. If such additional financing cannot be arranged, however, Entergy Arkansas must repurchase sufficient nuclear fuel to allow the lessor to meet its obligations.    

In addition, Entergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $73.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $21.6 million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the 

263 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Arkansas’ pension contributions in the future. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $178.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas also reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. The above amounts include approximately $420 million for installation of scrubbers and low NOx burners at Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff coal plant, which is discussed below. Entergy Arkansas continues to review potential environmental spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing analysis. 

White Bluff Coal Plant Project 

In June 2005 the EPA issued final Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially result in a requirement to install SO2 pollution control technology on certain of Entergy's coal and oil generation units. The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the states. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule. The ADEQ determined that Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area visibility and will be subject to the EPA's presumptive BART requirements to install scrubbers and low NOx burners. Under current regulations, the scrubbers would have to be operational by October 2013. Entergy filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission requesting a variance from this deadline, however, because the EPA has not approved Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP and the EPA has recently expressed concerns about Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air permit prior to that approval. Entergy Arkansas' petition requests that, consistent with federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA approval of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP. The Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology (PC&E) Commission adopted a procedural schedule that includes a public hearing and a comment period ending in March 2010 with the expectation that the variance could be considered at the Commission's March 26, 2010 meeting. The timeline for EPA action on the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP is uncertain at this time. 

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas made a filing with the APSC seeking a declaratory order that the White Bluff project is in the public interest. In May 2009 the APSC Staff filed a motion requesting that the APSC require Entergy Arkansas to file testimony on several issues. In December 2009, in response to the EPA concerns regarding Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP, the APSC suspended the procedural schedule in the proceeding. 

Currently, the White Bluff project is suspended, but the latest conceptual cost estimate indicated that Entergy Arkansas' share of the project could cost approximately $465 million. The plant would continue to operate during construction, although an outage would be necessary to complete the tie in of the scrubbers. Entergy continues to review potential environmental spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing analysis. 

Ouachita Power Plant 

Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC in September 2007 for its approval of the Ouachita plant acquisition, including full cost recovery. In June 2008 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas' acquisition of the Ouachita plant and approved recovery of the acquisition and ownership costs through a rate rider. The APSC also approved the planned sale of one-third of the capacity and energy to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Arkansas purchased the Ouachita plant in September 2008. 

264 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In August 2008, the LPSC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff authorizing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's purchase, under a life-of-unit agreement, of one-third of the capacity and energy from the 789 MW Ouachita power plant. The LPSC's approval was subject to certain conditions, including a study to determine the costs and benefits of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to purchase one-third of the plant (Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising its option to convert its purchased power agreement into the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities. In September 2009 the LPSC, pursuant to an uncontested settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost recovery mechanism. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in November 2009. 

Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, market volatility, economic trends, environmental compliance, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Arkansas' long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2009, Entergy Arkansas had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $461.6 million. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Arkansas' sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Arkansas may refinance or redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas' corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

In April 2009, Entergy Arkansas renewed its credit facility through April 2010 in the amount of $88 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Entergy Arkansas credit facility as of December 31, 2009. 

Entergy Arkansas' receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In May 2007, $1.8 million of Entergy Arkansas' receivable from the money pool was replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

265 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy Arkansas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas' short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Arkansas has also obtained an order from the APSC authorizing long-term securities issuances through December 2012. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

Retail Rates 

2006 Base Rate Filing 

In August 2006, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a request for a change in base rates. Entergy Arkansas requested a general base rate increase (using an ROE of 11.25%), which it subsequently adjusted to a request for a $106.5 million annual increase. In June 2007, after hearings on the filing, the APSC ordered Entergy Arkansas to reduce its annual rates by $5 million, and set a return on common equity of 9.9% with a hypothetical common equity level lower than Entergy Arkansas' actual capital structure. For the purpose of setting rates, the APSC disallowed a portion of costs associated with incentive compensation based on financial measures and all costs associated with Entergy's stock-based compensation plans. In addition, under the terms of the APSC's decision, the order eliminated storm reserve accounting and set an amount of $14.4 million in base rates to address storm restoration costs, regardless of the actual annual amount of future restoration costs. The APSC's June 2007 decision left Entergy Arkansas with no mechanism to recover $52 million of costs previously accumulated in Entergy Arkansas' storm reserve and $18 million of removal costs associated with the termination of a lease. 

The APSC denied Entergy Arkansas' request for rehearing of its June 2007 decision, and the base rate change was implemented August 29, 2007, effective for bills rendered after June 15, 2007. In December 2008 the Arkansas Court of Appeals upheld almost all aspects of the APSC decision. After considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Entergy Arkansas recorded in the fourth quarter 2008 an approximately $70 million charge to earnings, on both a pre- and after-tax basis because these are primarily flow-through items, to recognize that the regulatory assets associated with the storm reserve costs, lease termination removal costs, and stock-based compensation are no longer probable of recovery. In April 2009 the Arkansas Supreme Court denied Entergy Arkansas' petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision. 

2009 Base Rate Filing 

On September 4, 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. Entergy Arkansas requested a $223.2 million base rate increase that would become effective in July 2010. The filing reflects an 11.5% return on common equity using a projected capital structure, and proposes a formula rate plan mechanism. Proposed formula rate plan provisions include a +/- 25 basis point bandwidth, with earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the 11.5% return on common equity midpoint and rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy Arkansas is over or under-earning. The proposed formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for APSC-approved costs for additional capacity purchases or construction/acquisition of new transmission or generating facilities. Entergy Arkansas is also seeking an increase in its annual storm damage accrual from $14.4 million to $22.3 million. The APSC scheduled hearings in the proceeding beginning in May 2010. 

Production Cost Allocation Rider 

In its June 2007 decision on Entergy Arkansas' August 2006 rate filing, the APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings. These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas' deferred fuel cost balance, because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. In December 2007, the APSC issued a subsequent order stating that termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing.

Energy Cost Recovery Rider 

Entergy Arkansas' retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider. In December 2007, the APSC issued an order stating that termination of the energy cost recovery rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing. 

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its annual energy cost rate for the period April 2009 through March 2010. The filed energy cost rate decreased from $0.02456/kWh to $0.01552/kWh. The decrease was caused by the following: 1) all three of the nuclear power plants from which Entergy Arkansas obtains power, ANO 1 and 2 and Grand Gulf, had refueling outages in 2008, and the previous energy cost rate had been adjusted to account for the replacement power costs that would be incurred while these units were down; 2) Entergy Arkansas had a deferred fuel cost liability from over-recovered fuel costs at December 31, 2008, as compared to a deferred fuel cost asset from under-recovered fuel costs at December 31, 2007; offset by 3) an increase in the fuel and purchased power prices included in the calculation. 

In August 2009, as provided for by its energy cost recovery rider, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an interim revision to its energy cost rate. The revised energy cost rate is a decrease from $0.01552/kWh to $0.01206/kWh. The decrease was caused by a decrease in natural gas and purchased power prices from the levels used in setting the rate in March 2009. The interim revised energy cost rate went into effect for the first billing cycle of September 2009. In its order approving the new rate, the APSC ordered Entergy Arkansas to show cause why the rate should not be further reduced. In its September 14, 2009 response, Entergy Arkansas explained that it used the same methodology it had used in previous interim revisions, which is based on estimating what the rate would be in the next annual update based on the information known at the time. There has been no further activity in this proceeding. 

APSC Investigations 

In September 2005, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an interim energy cost rate per the energy cost recovery rider, which provides for an interim adjustment should the cumulative over- or under-recovery for the energy period exceed 10 percent of the energy costs for that period. In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an investigation into Entergy Arkansas' interim energy cost rate. The investigation is focused on Entergy Arkansas' 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. In March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in Entergy Arkansas' March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October 2006. 

In January 2007, the APSC issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. The APSC found that Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. The coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and Entergy has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. The APSC staff was directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas' assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within 60 days of the order. After a final determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the order. In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas' petition for rehearing and for stay of the APSC order. 

In October 2008, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas' rehearing petition and because the value for Entergy Arkansas' customers obtained through the resolved railroad litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions identified by the APSC as imprudent. The APSC staff, the AEEC, and the Arkansas attorney general support the lifting of the stay but request additional proceedings. In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas' rehearing request and of the unresolved issues in the proceeding. The APSC ordered the 

267 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

parties to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which the parties have done. In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas' request for rehearing, and scheduled a hearing for September 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy Arkansas. 

The APSC also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concludes with testimony through September 2010. The APSC may set a hearing in a future order, if necessary. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

Entergy Arkansas Storm Reserve Accounting 

The APSC's June 2007 order in Entergy Arkansas' base rate proceeding eliminated storm reserve accounting for Entergy Arkansas. In March 2009 a law was enacted in Arkansas that requires the APSC to permit storm reserve accounting for utilities that request it. Entergy Arkansas filed its request with the APSC, and has reinstated storm reserve accounting effective January 1, 2009. A hearing on Entergy Arkansas' request is scheduled for March 2010. 

Entergy Arkansas January 2009 Ice Storm 

In January 2009 a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas' transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. On January 30, 2009, the APSC issued an order inviting and encouraging electric public utilities to file specific proposals for the recovery of extraordinary storm restoration expenses associated with the ice storm. On February 16, 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed a request with the APSC for an accounting order authorizing deferral of the operating and maintenance cost portion of Entergy Arkansas' ice storm restoration costs pending their recovery. The APSC issued such an order in March 2009 subject to certain conditions, including that if Entergy Arkansas seeks to recover the deferred costs, those costs will be subject to investigation for whether they are incremental, prudent, and reasonable. A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs. On February 1, 2010, Entergy Arkansas requested a financing order to issue approximately $127.5 million in storm recovery bonds, which included carrying costs of $11.7 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs to pay for ice storm restoration because Entergy Arkansas' analysis demonstrates retail customers will benefit from lower costs using securitization. The APSC has established a procedural schedule that includes a hearing in April 2010 and states that the APSC will issue its final order by June 15, 2010. Entergy Arkansas' September 2009 general rate filing also requested recovery of the January 2009 ice storm costs over 10 years if it was expected that securitization would not produce lower costs for customers, and Entergy Arkansas will remove this request if the APSC approves securitization. 

Co-Owner-Initiated Proceeding at the FERC 

In October 2004, Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation (AECC) filed a complaint at the FERC against Entergy Arkansas relating to a contract dispute over the pricing of substitute energy at the co-owned Independence and White Bluff coal plants. The main issue in the case related to the consequences under the governing contracts when the dispatch of the coal units is constrained due to system operating conditions. A hearing was held on the AECC complaint and an ALJ Initial Decision was issued in January 2006 in which the ALJ found AECC's claims to be without merit. On October 25, 2006, the FERC issued its order in the proceeding. In the order, the FERC reversed the ALJ's findings. Specifically, the FERC found that the governing contracts do not recognize the effects of dispatch constraints on the co-owned units. The FERC explained that for over twenty-three years the course of conduct of the parties was such that AECC received its full entitlement to the two coal units, regardless of any reduced output caused by system operating constraints. Based on the order, Entergy Arkansas is required to refund to AECC all excess amounts billed to AECC as a result of the system operating constraints. The FERC denied Entergy Arkansas' request

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

for rehearing and Entergy Arkansas refunded $22.1 million (including interest) to AECC in September 2007. Entergy Arkansas had previously recorded a provision for the estimated effect of this refund. In January 2010 the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the refund report and ordering further refunds, noting that the refund period should have included the period July 1, 2004 through December 23, 2004. Entergy Arkansas had previously recorded a provision for the estimated effect of this refund.

Utility Restructuring 

In April 1999, the Arkansas legislature enacted Act 1556, the Arkansas Electric Consumer Choice Act, providing for competition in the electric utility industry through retail open access. In December 2001, the APSC recommended to the Arkansas General Assembly that legislation be enacted during the 2003 legislative session to either repeal Act 1556 or further delay retail open access until at least 2010. In February 2003, the Arkansas legislature voted to repeal Act 1556 and the repeal was signed into law by the governor. 

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to ANO and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines and includes in-service examinations, replacement and mitigation strategy. Several major modifications to the ANO units have been implemented to mitigate the susceptibility of large bore dissimilar metal welds. In addition, a replacement reactor vessel head has been fabricated for ANO 2. Routine inspections of the existing ANO 2 reactor vessel head have identified no significant material degradation issues for that component. These inspections will continue at planned refueling outages. Timing for installation of the new reactor vessel head will be based on the results of future inspection efforts. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Arkansas' facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. See "Uses of Capital" above for a discussion of the project to install scrubbers and low NOx burners at Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff coal plant, which under current environmental regulations must be operational by September 2013.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Arkansas' financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas' financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See "Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

In the first quarter 2009, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and 2 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimates resulted in an $8.9 million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory asset. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy's reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2009 was $19.8 million. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to be approximately $31.7 million. Entergy Arkansas' contributions to the pension trust were $24.8 million in 2009 and are currently estimated to be approximately $73.1 million in 2010; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Arkansas’ pension contributions in the future. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Arkansas in 2009 were $21.9 million, including $4.9 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $18.9 million, including $5.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects to contribute approximately $21.6 million to other postretirement plans in 2010.

ENTERGY GULF STATES LOUISIANA, L.L.C. 

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas 

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Management believes that the jurisdictional separation will better align Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve. The jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity. 

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31, 2007. Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt, which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of which $168 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2009. The pro rata share of the long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation. Entergy Texas' debt assumption does not discharge Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's liability for the long-term debt. To secure its debt assumption obligations, Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana a first lien on Entergy Texas' assets that were previously subject to the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. mortgage. Entergy Texas has until December 31, 2010 to repay the assumed debt. In addition, Entergy Texas, as the owner of Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC ("EGSRF I"), reports the $329.5 million of senior secured transition bonds ("securitization bonds") issued by EGSRF I as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet. The securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas. 

Entergy Texas will purchase from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend's nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant's output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will purchase a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas will purchase a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. The PPAs associated with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when retail open access commences in Entergy Texas' jurisdiction or when the unit(s) is no longer dispatched by the Entergy System. If Entergy Texas implements retail open access, it will terminate its participation in the System Agreement, except for the portion of the System Agreement related to transmission equalization. The dispatch and operation of the generating plants will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation. 

As the successor to Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for financial reporting purposes, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's income statement and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2007 include the operations of Entergy Texas.

Results of Operations 

Effect of Jurisdictional Separation on 2008 Results of Operations 

Following are income statement variances for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana comparing the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007 showing how much the line item increased or (decreased) in comparison to the prior period: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased by $8.3 million primarily due to higher net revenue, lower interest and other charges, and lower taxes other than income taxes, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate and lower other income. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income decreased $48 million primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007, in addition to lower other income and lower net revenue other than the effects directly caused by the jurisdictional separation, partially offset by lower other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower effective income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Entergy Texas reported net income of $58.9 million. 

Net Revenue 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

281 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009 relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effects of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008, and the effect of more favorable weather. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: 

  ·    a formula rate plan provision of $3.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009 for refunds made to customers in November 2009 in accordance with a settlement approved by the LPSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the settlement;    

  ·    a credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    a net decrease in the formula rate plan effective September 2008 to remove interim storm recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as well as the storm damage accrual. A portion of the decrease is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan.    

The decrease was partially offset by a formula rate plan increase effective September 2008 and November 2009. Refer to "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - State and Local Rate Regulation - -Retail Rates - Electric" and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $638.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates;    

  ·    a decrease of $245 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales; and    

  ·    a decrease of $33.5 million in gross gas revenue primarily due to lower fuel rates.    

The decrease was partially offset by formula rate plan increases effective November 2009 as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power and a decrease in deferred fuel expense due to decreased recovery from customers of fuel costs in addition to a credit recorded in the fourth quarter 2009 as a result of a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology as explained above. 

282 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2008 to 2007. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net revenue decreased primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007. 

The Other variance is primarily caused by various operational effects of the jurisdictional separation on revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

The change in gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges was primarily caused by the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $7.7 million in storm damage reserves in 2009 as a result of the completion of the Act 55 storm cost financing and a decrease of $5.5 million in payroll-related costs. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor and contract costs. 

Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes as a result of lower residential and commercial revenue. 

Other income decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $15.6 million in interest and dividend income related to the debt assumption agreement with Entergy Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable on this debt, of which $168 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and $770 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2008;    

  ·    the decrease of $4.7 million in carrying charges on Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm restoration costs as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    a decrease of $3.5 million in interest earned on money pool investments.    

The decrease is partially offset by additional distributions of $8.7 million earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm costs financings and $5.5 million in carrying charges on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease of $421 million in long-term debt outstanding. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a description of the decrease in long-term debt. 

283 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $179.1 million due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007;    

  ·    a decrease of $16.3 million in payroll, payroll-related, and benefit costs;    

  ·    a decrease of $9.7 million in nuclear labor and contract costs due to a non-refueling plant outage in March 2007; and    

  ·    a decrease of $10.1 million in plant maintenance costs.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.8 million in transmission spending due to higher transmission equalization expenses. 

Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007. 

Nuclear refueling outage expenses increased due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with the planned maintenance and refueling outage at River Bend in the first quarter 2008 as well as the delay of this outage from late 2007 to early 2008 resulting in a shorter amortization period for these costs. 

Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007. 

Other income includes $60 million in interest and dividend income in 2008 related to the debt assumption agreement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas and the $1.079 billion of debt assumed by Entergy Texas as of December 31, 2007. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable on this debt, of which $770 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2008. The increase in interest income is partially offset by $34 million of other income reported by Entergy Texas for the year ended December 31, 2007. The income from the debt assumption agreement offsets the interest expense on the portion of long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas. The remaining variance is primarily due to the cessation of carrying charges on storm restoration costs as a result of the securitization and a decrease in interest earned on money pool investments, partially offset by dividends of $10.3 million earned on preferred stock purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 Storm Cost Financings. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Interest and other charges decreased primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007 and due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates were 36.8%, 28.3%, and 39.1% for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $328 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to storm cost proceeds of $274.7 million received from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC) as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing in 2008, decreased recovery of deferred fuel costs, and income tax payments of $60.6 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $1.8 million in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of $28.2 million in pension contributions and fluctuation in the timing of accounts receivable and payable activity. 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $2.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to storm cost proceeds of $274.7 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing, almost entirely offset by the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007, increased recovery of fuel costs, and an increase of $17.9 million in pension contributions. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $232.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment of $189.4 million in affiliate securities in 2008 as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

  ·    higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Gustav;    

  ·    the purchase of the Calcasieu Generating Facility for $56 million in March 2008; and    

  ·    timing differences between nuclear fuel purchases and fuel trust reimbursements.    

The decrease was partially offset by money pool activity and the purchase of one-third of the Ouachita Power Plant for $75 million in November 2009 from Entergy Arkansas. See "Ouachita Power Plant" below for a discussion of the purchase of the Ouachita Power Plant. Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivable from the money pool increased by $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to decreasing by $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 

285 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $282.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the cash allocated to Entergy Texas in the jurisdictional separation transaction in 2007 and due to the effect of the jurisdictional separation on money pool activity. The decrease was partially offset by the investment of $189.4 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm costs financings and the purchase of the Calcasieu Generating Facility for $56 million. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Calcasieu, a 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired power plant, from a subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. The facility is located near the city of Sulphur in southwestern Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received the plant, materials and supplies, SO2 emission allowances, and related real estate in the transaction. The FERC and the LPSC approved the acquisition. 

Decreases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivable from the money pool decreased by $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to increasing by $134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 

Financing Activities 

Financing activities provided cash of $146.7 million in 2009 compared to using cash of $102.3 million in 2008 primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.59% Series first mortgage bonds in October 2009 and a decrease of $73.5 million in common equity distributions, partially offset by the retirement of $119 million of long term debt in 2009. 

Financing activities used cash of $102.3 million in 2008 compared to providing cash of $168.4 million in 2007 primarily due to the issuance of $329.5 million of securitization bonds in June 2007 by a subsidiary of Entergy Texas, partially offset by the redemption of all outstanding shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s preferred stock in December 2007. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The calculation below does not reduce the debt by the debt assumed by Entergy Texas ($168 million as of December 31, 2009, and $770 million as of December 31, 2008) because Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable on the debt. The reduction in the debt to capital ratio in 2009 is primarily due to the repayment in 2009 of $602 million of assumed debt by Entergy Texas. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, preferred membership interests with sinking fund, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members' equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred equity maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    distribution and interest payments.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Following are the amounts of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $128 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.  

  (4)   It is expected that additional financing under the leases will be arranged as needed to acquire additional fuel, to pay interest, and to pay maturing debt. If such additional financing cannot be arranged, however, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana must repurchase sufficient nuclear fuel to allow the lessor to meet its obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute $21.9 million to its pension plans and $8.4 million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s pension contributions in the future. 

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has $245.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred membership interest maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests.

Ouachita Power Plant 

In August 2008, the LPSC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff authorizing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's purchase, under a life-of-unit agreement, of one-third of the capacity and energy from the 789 MW Ouachita power plant. The LPSC's approval was subject to certain conditions, including a study to determine the costs and benefits of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to purchase one-third of the plant (Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising its option to convert its purchased power agreement into the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities. In September 2009 the LPSC, pursuant to an uncontested settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost recovery mechanism. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in November 2009. 

New Nuclear Development 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC's general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and will recognize on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company's current participation level in the project. In response to the companies' previous notice, dated August 10, 2009, the LPSC opened a docket. A procedural schedule will be established after the companies file the certification application referred to in the notice. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may refinance or redeem debt and preferred equity/membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

  All debt and common and preferred equity/membership interest issuances by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred equity/membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2009. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011. 

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike 

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In October 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana drew all of its $85 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's request to defer and accrue carrying cost on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm cost or final carrying cost rate. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing to, among other things, recommend recovery of the costs and replenishment of the storm reserves by Louisiana Act 55 (passed in 2007) financing. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recovered their costs from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita primarily by Act 55 financing, as discussed below. On December 30, 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that, if approved, provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when Act 55 financing is accomplished. The parties to the proceeding have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes March/April 2010 hearing dates for both the recoverability and the method of recovery proceedings. 

Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina 

In August and September 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit Entergy Gulf States Inc.'s jurisdictions in Louisiana and Texas. The storms resulted in power outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursued a range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs and incremental losses. Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery through existing or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local regulatory bodies, in combination with securitization. 

Insurance Claims 

Entergy has received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers. Of the $317 million received, $21 million was allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy has substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.

Storm Cost Financings 

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature (Act 55 financings). The Act 55 financings are expected to produce additional customer benefits as compared to Act 64 traditional securitization. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. On April 3, 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted preliminary approval for the Act 55 financings. On April 8, 2008, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55 financings. On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five years. On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings. In May 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings. 

On August 26, 2008, the LPFA issued $278.4 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55. From the $274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $187.7 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana invested $189.4 million, including $1.7 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 1,893,918.39 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the event of a bond default. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Retail Rates - Electric 

In March 2005, the LPSC approved a settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. The settlement included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that, among other provisions, establishes a return on common equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula rate plan filing in June 2005. The formula rate plan was subsequently extended one year. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 

290 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolves Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's 2007 test year filing. The settlement provides for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test year. 10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% - 11.40%). The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a $36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset will be subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made on October 21, 2009. The settlement does not allow recovery through the formula rate plan of most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's costs associated with Entergy's stock option plan. Pursuant to the settlement Entergy Gulf States Louisiana refunded to its customers $3.7 million, which includes interest, in the November 2009 billing cycle. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC. The discovery and comment period for the 2008 test year filing is currently open, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will implement any agreed changes by March 15, 2010. A procedural schedule to address any contested issues would be set after March 15, 2010. 

In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an application seeking LPSC approval for a $9.7 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70% share of River Bend, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. Currently, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's annual retail rates contain no amount for decommissioning funding. 

In May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2007 test year. The filing reflected a 9.26% return on common equity, which was below the allowed earnings bandwidth, and indicated a $5.4 million revenue deficiency, offset by a $4.1 million decrease in required additional capacity costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $20.7 million formula rate plan decrease, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in September 2008. The decrease included removal of interim storm cost recovery and a reduction in the storm damage accrual. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then implemented a $16.0 million formula rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in October 2008 to collect previously deferred and ongoing costs associated with LPSC approved additional capacity, including the Ouachita power plant. In November 2008 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed to implement an additional increase of $9.3 million to recover the costs of a new purchased power agreement. 

In May 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2006 test year. The filing reflected a 10.0% return on common equity, which was within the allowed earnings bandwidth, and an anticipated formula rate plan decrease of $23 million annually attributable to adjustments outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism related to capacity costs and the anticipated securitization of storm costs related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the securitization of a storm reserve. In September 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana modified the formula rate plan filing to reflect a 10.07% return on common equity, which was still within the allowed bandwidth. The modified filing also reflected implementation of a $4.1 million rate increase, subject to refund, attributable to recovery of additional LPSC-approved incremental deferred and ongoing capacity costs. The rate decrease anticipated in the original filing did not occur because of the additional capacity costs approved by the LPSC, and because securitization of storm costs associated with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the establishment of a storm reserve had not yet occurred. In October 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $16.4 million formula rate plan decrease that was due to the reclassification of certain franchise fees from base rates to collection via a line item on customer bills pursuant to an LPSC order. In March 2008 the LPSC approved an uncontested stipulated settlement that left the current base rates in place and extended the formula rate plan for one year. 

In May 2006, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2005 test year. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana modified the filing in August 2006 to reflect an 11.1% return on common equity which is within the allowed bandwidth. The modified filing includes a formula rate plan increase of $17.2 million annually that provides for 1) interim recovery of $10.5 million of storm costs from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and 2) recovery of $6.7 million of LPSC-approved incremental deferred and ongoing

capacity costs. The increase was implemented with the first billing cycle of September 2006. In May 2007 the LPSC approved a settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff, affirming the rates that were implemented in September 2006. 

Retail Rates - Gas 

In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2009. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus fifty basis points. The sixty day review and comment period for this filing remains open. 

In January 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2008. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $529 thousand based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $255 thousand rate increase pursuant to an uncontested settlement with the LPSC staff. 

In January 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2007. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $3.7 million based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $3.4 million rate increase in April 2008 pursuant to an uncontested agreement with the LPSC staff. 

In January 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2006. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $3.5 million based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. In March 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a set of rate and rider schedules that reflected all proposed LPSC staff adjustments and implemented a $2.4 million base rate increase effective with the first billing cycle of April 2007 pursuant to the rate stabilization plan.

In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's industrial customer base. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and operates, through an affiliate, the River Bend nuclear power plant. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See "Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries' Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy's reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions,

and accounting mechanisms. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension income for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2009 was $1.2 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to be $10 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana contributed $6 million to its pension plans in 2009 and estimates 2010 pension contributions to be approximately $21.9 million; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s pension contributions in the future. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2009 were $14.7 million, including $3.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $16.6 million, including $3.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $8.4 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010.

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $75.3 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate, higher other income, higher net revenue, and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income increased $14.2 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, higher other income, and a lower effective income tax rate, offset by lower net revenue and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Net Revenue 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 504 GWh in billed electricity usage in all sectors, an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effect of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008, and the effect of more favorable weather. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: 

      ·   a credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

      ·   a net decrease in the formula rate plan effective August 2008 to remove interim storm cost recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as well as the storm damage accrual. A portion of the decrease is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan; and    

      ·   a formula rate plan provision of $12.9 million recorded in the third quarter 2009 for refunds made to customers in November 2009 in accordance with a settlement approved by the LPSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the settlement.    

The decrease was offset by an interruptible load provision of $13.4 million recorded in 2008 for rate refunds that occurred in August and September 2009 and formula rate plan increases effective November 2009. 

302 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Refer to "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the interim recovery of storm costs and the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $763.4 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates and a decrease of $108.1 million in rider revenues. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $36.7 million related to volume/weather, as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power and a decrease in the recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs. 

Other regulatory charges decreased primarily due to the amortization of deferred capacity charges, which ceased in August 2009, as a result of the May 2006 formula rate plan filing with the LPSC, the recognition of interim storm cost recoveries that ceased in July 2008 with the Act 55 financing of storm costs, and the refunds of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance proceeds occurring over a twelve-month period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan, the interim recovery of storm costs, and the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2008 to 2007. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to the cessation of the interim storm recovery through the formula rate plan upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs and a credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing, partially offset by increases in the formula rate plan effective October 2007. Refer to "Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" and "State and Local Rate Regulation" below for a discussion of the interim recovery of storm costs, the Act 55 storm cost financing, and the formula rate plan filing. 

The purchased power capacity variance is due to the amortization of deferred capacity costs effective September 2007 as a result of the formula rate plan filing in May 2007. Purchased power capacity costs are offset in base revenues due to a base rate increase implemented to recover incremental deferred and ongoing purchased power capacity charges. See "State and Local Rate Regulation" below for a discussion of the formula rate plan filing. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to provisions recorded for potential rate refunds related to the treatment of interruptible load in pricing Entergy System affiliate sales. 

303 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $364.7 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates offset by decreased usage. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $56.8 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in System Agreement rough production cost equalization credits. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by a decrease in the recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $6.5 million in payroll-related costs and a decrease of $6.4 million in loss reserves in 2009, including a decrease in the storm damage reserve. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $9.0 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor and contract costs. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $25 million in distributions earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm cost financing. See "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress throughout 2009.    

Interest and other charges increased slightly primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 6.50% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009, substantially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2009. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $9.3 million in nuclear spending due to a prior year non-refueling outage;    

  ·    a decrease of $8.6 million in payroll-related costs;    

  ·    a decrease of $8.1 million in loss reserves for storm damage in 2008 because of completion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    a decrease of $5.7 million in customer service costs primarily as a result of write-offs in 2007 of uncollectible customer accounts.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million in transmission spending due to additional costs related to compliance, substation maintenance, and line and vegetation maintenance and an increase of $4.3 million in fossil expenses due to a fossil plant maintenance outage in 2008. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    a revision in the third quarter 2007 related to depreciation on storm cost-related assets. Recovery of the cost of those assets will now be through the Act 55 financing of storm costs as approved by the LPSC in the third quarter 2007. See "Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

304 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    a revision in the fourth quarter 2008 of estimated depreciable lives involving certain intangible assets in accordance with formula rate plan treatment; and    

  ·    an increase in plant in service.    

Other income increased primarily due to: 

  ·    distributions of $29.5 million earned on preferred stock purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 Storm Cost Financings;    

  ·    interest earned on the deferred fuel balance;    

  ·    carrying charges on storm restoration costs approved by the LPSC; and    

  ·    an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2008.    

See "Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" below for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 16.2%, 31.0%, and 36.8%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2009 is primarily due to the reallocation of Entergy Corporation consolidated tax benefits based on the partial settlement of IRS audits of prior tax years, the exclusion of dividend income from Entergy Louisiana's preferred membership interest in Entergy Holdings Company, LLC, and the flow-through of the equity component of AFUDC. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate and for a discussion of the IRS audits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $994.7 million primarily due to storm cost proceeds of $679 million received in 2008 from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing and income tax payments of $223.6 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $12.7 million in 2008. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the tax payments in 2009. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $729.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to storm cost proceeds of $679 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing and income tax refunds of $12.7 million in 2008 compared to income tax payments of $119.1 million in 2007. The increase was partially offset by a lower amount of fuel costs recovered in 2008 than in 2007. See "Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" below for a discussion of the storm cost financings. 

305 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $734.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment in 2008 of $545 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

  ·    higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike;    

  ·    the suspension of the Little Gypsy repowering project in 2009. See "Little Gypsy Repowering Project" below for a discussion of the suspension;    

  ·    lower transmission construction expenditures in 2009; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

The decrease was partially offset by increased nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project, the dry fuel storage project, security upgrades, and the reactor coolant pump upgrades project. 

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana's receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana's receivable from the money pool decreased $8.4 million in 2009 compared to increasing $61.2 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $873.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment of $545 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See "Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina" below for a discussion of the storm cost financings;    

  ·    increased construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike, the Little Gypsy Unit 3 repowering project, and various nuclear projects; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Increases in Entergy Louisiana's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana's receivable from the money pool increased by $61.2 million in 2008. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Louisiana's cash flow provided by financing activities increased $134.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009 compared to the issuance of $300 million of 6.50% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and the repurchase in 2008 of $60 million of Auction Rate governmental bonds, partially offset by an increase of $20.6 million in common equity distributions paid in 2009. 

Entergy Louisiana's financings activities provided $227.0 million of cash in 2008 compared to using $58.4 million of cash in 2007 primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 6.50% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and money pool activity, partially offset by the repurchase, prior to maturity, of $60 million of Auction Rate governmental bonds, which are being held for remarketing at a later date. 

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana's payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana's payable to the money pool decreased $2.8 million in 2008 and $51.3 million in 2007. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Louisiana's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital for Entergy Louisiana as of December 31, 2009 is primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members' equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana's financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred equity maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    distribution and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana's planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $152 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Louisiana, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Vidalia purchased power agreement and the Unit Power Sales Agreement, both of which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.  

  (4)   It is expected that additional financing under the lease will be arranged as needed to acquire additional fuel, to pay interest, and to pay maturing debt. If such additional financing cannot be arranged, however, Entergy Louisiana must repurchase sufficient nuclear fuel to allow the lessor to meet its obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $27.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $9.9 million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Louisiana’s pension contributions in the future. 

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $282.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth, including the purchase of Acadia Unit 2 and the replacement of the Waterford 3 steam generators, which are discussed below, and dry cask spent fuel storage. Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

Acadia Unit 2 Purchase Agreement 

In October 2009 Entergy Louisiana announced that it signed an agreement to acquire Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice, La., from Acadia Power Partners, LLC, an independent power producer. The Acadia Energy Center, which entered commercial service in 2002, consists of two combined-cycle gas-fired generating units, each nominally rated at 580 MW. Entergy Louisiana proposes to acquire 100 percent of Acadia Unit 2 and a 50 percent ownership interest in the facility’s common assets for approximately $300 million. In a separate transaction, Cleco Power is acquiring Acadia Unit 1 and the other 50 percent interest in the facility’s common assets. Upon closing the transaction, Cleco Power will serve as operator for the entire facility. Entergy Louisiana has committed to sell one third of the output of Unit 2 to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in accordance with terms and conditions detailed under the existing Entergy System Agreement. 

Entergy Louisiana's purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. Closing is expected to occur in late 2010 or early 2011. Entergy Louisiana and Acadia Power Partners also have entered into a purchased power agreement for 100 percent of the output of Acadia Unit 2 that is expected to commence on May 1, 2010 and is set to expire at the closing of the acquisition transaction. Entergy Louisiana has filed with the LPSC for approval of the transaction, and no party filed an opposition to the purchase power agreement and it has been forwarded to the LPSC for its review. The parties have agreed to a procedural schedule for the acquisition that would lead to LPSC consideration of the matter at its January 2011 meeting and includes a hearing before the ALJ in September 2010. 

Waterford 3 Steam Generator Replacement Project 

Entergy Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in 2011. Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water reactors throughout the nuclear industry. The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with these components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard industry practices and guidelines. Routine inspections of the steam generators during Waterford 3's Fall 2006 refueling outage identified additional degradation of certain tube spacer supports in the steam generators that required repair beyond that anticipated prior to the outage. Corrective measures were successfully implemented to permit continued operation of the steam generators. While potential future replacement of these components had been contemplated, additional steam generator tube and component degradation necessitates replacement of 

308 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

the steam generators as soon as reasonably achievable. The earliest the new steam generators can be manufactured and delivered for installation is 2011. A mid-cycle outage performed in 2007 supports Entergy Louisiana's 2011 replacement strategy. The reactor vessel head and control element drive mechanisms will be replaced at the same time, utilizing the same reactor building construction opening that is necessary for the steam generator replacement.  

In June 2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the project, including full cost recovery. Following discovery and the filing of testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement of the proceeding. The LPSC unanimously approved the settlement in November 2008. The settlement resolved the following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision to undertake the replacement project at the current estimated cost of $511 million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the target installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest; and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extention or renewal of the formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary proforma adjustments. Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. 

In July 2009, the LPSC granted Entergy Louisiana's motion to dismiss, without prejudice, its application seeking recovery of cash earnings on construction work in progress (CWIP) for the steam generator replacement project, acknowledging Entergy Louisiana's right, at any time, to seek cash earnings on CWIP if Entergy Louisiana believes that circumstances or projected circumstances are such that a request for cash earnings on CWIP is merited. The cash earnings on CWIP application had been consolidated with a similar request for the Little Gypsy repowering project, which was also dismissed in response to the same motion. 

Entergy Louisiana estimates that it will spend approximately $511 million on this project, including $299 million over the 2010-2011 period. 

Little Gypsy Repowering Project 

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed subsequently with the LPSC seeking certification to participate in one-third of the project. Petroleum coke and coal would be the unit's primary fuel sources. In July 2007, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the repowering project. In addition to seeking a finding that the project is in the public interest, the filing with the LPSC asked that Entergy Louisiana be allowed to recover a portion of the project's financing costs during the construction period. 

On March 11, 2009, the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project's economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. This action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. On April 1, 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC's directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. Entergy Louisiana estimated that its total costs for the project, if suspended, including actual spending to date and estimated contract cancellation costs, would be approximately $300 million. Entergy Louisiana had obtained all major environmental permits required to begin construction. A longer-term suspension places these permits at risk and may adversely affect the project's economics and technological feasibility. On May 22, 2009, the LPSC issued an order declaring that Entergy Louisiana's decision to place the Little Gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent. In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the project and seeking recovery over a five-year period of the project costs. The parties to the proceeding agreed to a procedural schedule that results in a hearing in October 2010. Entergy Louisiana currently estimates that its total costs for the project, if canceled, will be approximately $215 million, of which approximately $193 million was incurred through December 31, 2009.

New Nuclear Development 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC's general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and will recognize on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company's current participation level in the project. In response to the companies' previous notice, dated August 10, 2009, the LPSC opened a docket. A procedural schedule will be established after the companies file the certification application referred to in the notice. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana's sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new and existing facilities.    

Entergy Louisiana may refinance or redeem debt and preferred membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and distribution rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Louisiana's receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $200 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2009. 

Entergy Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana's short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011.

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike 

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav (and, to a much lesser extent, Hurricane Ike) caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Louisiana's service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. On October 9, 2008, Entergy Louisiana drew all of its $134 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana's request to defer and accrue carrying costs on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm costs or final carrying costs rate. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing to, among other things, recommend recovery of the costs and replenishment of the storm reserves by Louisiana Act 55 (passed in 2007) financing. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recovered their costs from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita primarily by Act 55 financing, as discussed below. On December 30, 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that, if approved, provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when Act 55 financing is accomplished. The parties to the proceeding have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes March/April 2010 hearing dates for both the recoverability and the method of recovery proceedings. 

Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina 

In August and September 2005, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, along with extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around Entergy Louisiana's service territory, caused catastrophic damage. The storms and flooding resulted in widespread power outages; significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations and destruction of homes and businesses due to wind, rain, and extended periods of flooding. Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs and incremental losses. Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery through existing or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local regulatory bodies, in combination with securitization. 

Insurance Claims 

 Entergy has received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers. Of the $317 million received, $45 million was allocated to Entergy Louisiana. Entergy has substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 

Storm Cost Financings 

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature (Act 55 financings). The Act 55 financings are expected to produce additional customer benefits as compared to Act 64 traditional securitization. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. On April 3, 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted preliminary approval for the Act 55 financings. On April 8, 2008, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55

financings. On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five years. On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings. In May 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings. 

On July 29, 2008, the LPFA issued $687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55. From the $679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, including $17.8 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Entergy Louisiana made a rate filing with the LPSC requesting a base rate increase in January 2004. In May 2005 the LPSC approved a settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana. The initial formula rate plan filing was made in May 2006. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolves Entergy Louisiana's 2006 and 2007 test year filings. The settlement provides for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. Entergy Louisiana is permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. 10.25% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%). The rate reset, a $2.5 million increase that includes a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset will be subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made on October 21, 2009. The settlement does not allow recovery through the formula rate plan of most of Entergy Louisiana's costs associated with Entergy's stock option plan. Pursuant to the settlement Entergy Louisiana refunded to its customers $12.9 million, which includes interest, in the November 2009 billing cycle. The LPSC Staff and one intervenor filed comments on the 2008 test year filing in January 2010. Entergy Louisiana has until March 2010 to provide an initial response to the proposed adjustments and discovery is ongoing. Entergy Louisiana will implement any agreed changes by March 15, 2010. A procedural schedule to address any contested issues would be set after March 15, 2010.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In December 2009, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking LPSC approval for a $10.3 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for Waterford 3, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. Currently, Entergy Louisiana has $2.2 million in annual retail rates for decommissioning funding. 

In May 2008, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2007 test year, seeking an $18.4 million rate increase, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and deferred capacity costs and $5.8 million based on a cost of service revenue deficiency related to continued lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the loss of customers due to Hurricane Katrina. In August 2008, Entergy Louisiana implemented a $43.9 million formula rate plan decrease to remove interim storm cost recovery and to reduce the storm damage accrual. Entergy Louisiana then implemented a $16.9 million formula rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in September 2008, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and deferred capacity costs and $4.3 million based on a cost of service deficiency. 

In May 2007, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2006 test year, indicating a 7.6% earned return on common equity. In September 2007, Entergy Louisiana modified its formula rate plan filing to reflect its implementation of certain adjustments proposed by the LPSC Staff in its review of Entergy Louisiana's original filing with which Entergy Louisiana agreed, and to reflect its implementation of an $18.4 million annual formula rate plan increase comprised of (1) a $23.8 million increase representing 60% of Entergy Louisiana's revenue deficiency, and (2) a $5.4 million decrease for reduced incremental and deferred capacity costs. In October 2007, Entergy Louisiana implemented a $7.1 million formula rate plan decrease that was due primarily to the reclassification of certain franchise fees from base rates to collection via a line item on customer bills pursuant to an LPSC Order. 

In May 2006, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2005 test year. Entergy Louisiana modified the filing in August 2006 to reflect a 9.45% return on equity which is within the allowed bandwidth. The modified filing includes an increase of $24.2 million for interim recovery of storm costs from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and a $119.2 million rate increase to recover LPSC-approved incremental deferred and ongoing capacity costs. The filing requested recovery of approximately $50 million for the amortization of capacity deferrals over a three-year period, including carrying charges, and approximately $70 million for ongoing capacity costs. The increase was implemented, subject to refund, with the first billing cycle of September 2006. Entergy Louisiana subsequently updated its formula rate plan rider to reflect adjustments proposed by the LPSC Staff with which it agrees. The adjusted return on equity of 9.56% remains within the allowed bandwidth. Ongoing and deferred incremental capacity costs were reduced to $118.7 million. The updated formula rate plan rider was implemented, subject to refund, with the first billing cycle of October 2006. An uncontested stipulated settlement was filed in February 2008 that left the current base rates in place, and the LPSC approved the settlement in March 2008. In the settlement Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit customers $7.2 million, plus $0.7 million of interest, for customer contributions to the Central States Compact in Nebraska that was never completed and agreed to a one-time $2.6 million deduction from the deferred capacity cost balance. The credit, for which Entergy Louisiana had previously recorded a provision, was made in May 2008. 

In addition to rate proceedings, Entergy Louisiana's fuel costs recovered from customers are subject to regulatory scrutiny. This regulatory risk represents Entergy Louisiana's largest potential exposure to price changes in the commodity markets. 

Entergy Louisiana's retail rate matters and proceedings, including fuel cost recovery-related issues, are discussed further in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Federal Regulation 

Interruptible Load Proceeding 

See Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries' "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - System Agreement Proceedings - Interruptible Load Proceeding." In October 2009, the LPSC issued an order approving the flow through to retail rates of the LPSC-jurisdictional portion of the payments and credits resulting from the FERC's orders that had not yet been flowed through to retail rates, which required a net refund to retail customers of $17.6 million, including interest. Of this amount, $5.4 million was refunded subject to adjustment in the event that future action by the FERC or the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals results in a reversal or change in the amount of the refunds ordered by the FERC in September 2008.

See "Independent Coordinator of Transmission" in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries' Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion. 

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Louisiana's large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana's industrial customer base. Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Louisiana's marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Louisiana owns and operates, through an affiliate, the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard industry practices and guidelines. As discussed above in more detail, Entergy Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in 2011.

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Louisiana's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Louisiana's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana's financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See "Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy's reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2009 was $6.2 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to be $14.6 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $7.6 million to its pension plans in 2009 and anticipates funding approximately $27.1 million in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Louisiana’s pension contributions in the future. 

 Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2009 were $16.8 million, including $2.8 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $17.8 million, including $3.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $9.9 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010.

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $17.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income decreased $12.4 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue. 

Net Revenue 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective July 2009 and an increase in Attala power plant costs that are recovered through the power management rider. The formula rate plan filing is discussed further in "State and Local Rate Regulation" below. The net income effect of the Attala power plant costs recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Attala power plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to a change in a contract with a wholesale customer that increased its monthly demand charge and an increased net balance on joint account sales as a result of lower fuel prices in 2009. 

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to increased reserve equalization revenue as a result of changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2008. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $254.6 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates and decreased usage and a decrease of $52.1 million in gross wholesale revenues 

324 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

primarily due to a decrease in volume as a result of less energy available for resale sales, partially offset by an increase of $20.4 million in power management rider revenue. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power. 

Other regulatory charges (credits) decreased primarily due to decreased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider and decreased recovery through the Grand Gulf Rider of Grand Gulf capacity costs due to lower rates and decreased usage. There is no material effect on net income due to quarterly adjustments to the power management recovery rider and annual adjustments to the Grand Gulf rider. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the power management recovery rider and the Grand Gulf Rider. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2008 to 2007. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The Attala costs variance is primarily due to an increase in the Attala power plant costs that are recovered through the power management rider. The net income effect of this recovery in limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Attala power plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes. 

The rider revenue variance is the result of a storm damage rider that became effective in October 2007. The establishment of this rider results in an increase in rider revenue and a corresponding increase in other operation and maintenance expense for the storm reserve with no effect on net income. 

The base revenue variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective July 2007. The formula rate plan filing is discussed further in "State and Local Rate Regulation" below. 

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2007. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower profit on joint account sales and reduced capacity revenue from the Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $152.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates, partially offset by a decrease of $43 million in gross wholesale revenues due to a decrease in net generation and purchases in excess of decreased net area demand resulting in less energy available for resale sales coupled with a decrease in system agreement remedy receipts.

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by decreased demand and decreased recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs. 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to increased recovery through the Grand Gulf rider of Grand Gulf capacity costs due to higher rates and increased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider. There is no material effect on net income due to quarterly adjustments to the power management recovery rider. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the power management recovery rider and the Grand Gulf Rider. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to the gain recorded in 2009 on the sale of utility property, offset by a potential buyer's forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit in June 2008 for an option to purchase non-utility property. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $8.6 million in loss reserves in 2008 compared to 2007, including the effect of the storm damage rider implemented in October 2007;    

  ·    an increase of $3.5 million in fossil plant expenses due to increased outages, higher plant maintenance costs, and environmental costs;    

  ·    an increase of $2.8 million in distribution expenses due primarily to the timing of contract work and lower reimbursements; and    

  ·    an increase of $1.4 million in legal spending due to increased regulatory activity.    

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in payroll, payroll-related, and benefit costs. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income decreased primarily due to decreased interest earned on money pool investments and the gain recorded in 2007 on the sale of non-utility property. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 35.3%, 35.8%, and 33.2%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $142 million in 2009 primarily due to increased recovery of deferred fuel costs and a decrease of $5.9 million in pension contributions, offset by an increase of $22.4 million in income tax payments. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $89.2 million in 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    decreased recovery of deferred fuel and purchased power costs;    

  ·    the receipt of $48 million of securitization proceeds in 2007;    

  ·    the timing of collections of receivables from customers and payments to vendors; and    

  ·    an increase of $10.9 million in pension contributions.    

The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments. 

Investing Activities 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $26.2 million in 2009 primarily due to money pool activity, offset by decreased construction expenditures related to various fossil and distribution projects. 

Increases in Entergy Mississippi's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi's receivable from the money pool increased by $31.4 million in 2009. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy's subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $64.4 million in 2008 primarily due to the receipt of proceeds in 2007 from funds held in trust in 2006 that were used for the redemption in January 2007, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 4.35% Series First Mortgage Bonds, partially offset by the transfer in 2007 of $30.7 million to the storm damage reserve escrow account and money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi's receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi's receivable from the money pool decreased by $21 million in 2008. 

327 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Financing Activities 

Cash flow provided by financing activities increased $14 million in 2009 primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009, offset by money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi's payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi's payable to the money pool decreased by $66 million in 2009. 

Entergy Mississippi's financing activities provided $13.8 million in cash flow in 2008 compared to using $133.1 million in cash flow in 2007 primarily due to the redemption, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 4.35% Series First Mortgage Bonds in January 2007 and money pool activity, partially offset by an increase of $18 million in common stock dividends paid. 

Increases in Entergy Mississippi's payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi's payable to the money pool increased by $66 million in 2008. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Mississippi's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio is due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009, as discussed below. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and shareholders' equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi's financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred stock maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

328 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi's planned construction and other capital investments, and existing debt obligations and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $123 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems, and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $17.8 million to its pension plans and approximately $5 million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Mississippi's pension contributions in the future. 

 Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi has $8 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Mississippi's long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2009, Entergy Mississippi had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $236 million.

New Nuclear Development 

Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi is developing a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. Entergy Mississippi, together with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, has been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the Grand Gulf and River Bend Station sites. Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Mississippi paid for and has recognized on its books $49.5 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Mississippi's sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Mississippi may refinance or redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indenture, and other agreements. Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

In May and June 2009, Entergy Mississippi renewed its two separate credit facilities through May 2010. In August 2009, Entergy Mississippi increased its borrowing capacity with a third line of credit which will also expire in May 2010, increasing the borrowing limits to the aggregate amount of $70 million. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2009. 

Entergy Mississippi's receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In May 2007, $6.6 million of Entergy Mississippi's receivable from the money pool was replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

 Entergy Mississippi has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $175 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi's short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Mississippi has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Mississippi is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Formula Rate Plan 

In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider. The proposed modifications include: (1) resetting Entergy Mississippi's return on common equity to the middle of the formula rate plan bandwidth each year and eliminating the 50/50 sharing in the current plan, (2) replacing the current rate change limit of two percent of revenues subject to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap with a proposed limit of four percent of revenues, (3) implementing a projected test year for the annual filing and subsequent look-back for the prior year, and (4) modifying the performance measurement process. 

In March 2009, Entergy Mississippi made with the MPSC its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year. The filing reported a $27.0 million revenue deficiency and an earned return on common equity of 7.41%. Entergy Mississippi requested a $14.5 million increase in annual electric revenues, which is the maximum increase allowed under the terms of the formula rate plan. The MPSC issued an order on June 30, 2009, finding that Entergy Mississippi's earned return was sufficiently below the lower bandwidth limit set by the formula rate plan to require a $14.5 million increase in annual revenues, effective for bills rendered on or after June 30, 2009. 

In March 2008, Entergy Mississippi made its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2007 test year with the MPSC. The filing showed that a $10.1 million increase in annual electric revenues is warranted. In June 2008, Entergy Mississippi reached a settlement with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that would result in a $3.8 million rate increase. In January 2009 the MPSC rejected the settlement and left the current rates in effect. Entergy Mississippi appealed the MPSC's decision to the Mississippi Supreme Court. After the decision of the MPSC regarding the formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year, Entergy Mississippi filed a motion to dismiss its appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. 

In March 2007, Entergy Mississippi made its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2006 test year with the MPSC. The filing showed that an increase of $12.9 million in annual electric revenues is warranted. In June 2007 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities staff that provides for a $10.5 million rate increase, which was effective beginning with July 2007 billings. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Mississippi's rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior quarter. 

In July 2008 the MPSC began a proceeding to investigate the fuel procurement practices and fuel adjustment schedules of the Mississippi utility companies, including Entergy Mississippi. A two-day public hearing was held in July 2008, and after a recess during which the MPSC reviewed information, the hearing resumed on August 5, 2008, for additional testimony by an expert witness retained by the MPSC. The MPSC's witness presented testimony regarding a review of the utilities' fuel adjustment clauses. The MPSC stated that the goal of the proceeding is fact-finding so that the MPSC may decide whether to amend the current fuel cost recovery process. In February 2009 the MPSC published a final report of its expert witness, which discussed Entergy Mississippi's fuel procurement activities and made recommendations regarding fuel recovery practices in Mississippi. 

In addition, in October 2008 the MPSC issued an order directing Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Services to provide documents associated with fuel adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana involving Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, and in January 2009 issued an order requiring Entergy Mississippi to provide additional information related to the long-term Evangeline gas contract that had been an issue in the fuel adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana. Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Services filed a response 

331 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

to the MPSC order stating that gas from the Evangeline gas contract had been sold into the Entergy System exchange and had an effect on the costs paid by Entergy Mississippi's customers. The MPSC's investigation is ongoing. 

In August 2009 the MPSC retained an independent audit firm to audit Entergy Mississippi's fuel adjustment clause submittals for the period October 2007 through September 2009. The independent audit firm submitted its report to the MPSC in December 2009. The report does not recommend that any costs be disallowed for recovery. The report did suggest that some costs, less than one percent of the fuel and purchased power costs recovered during the period, may have been more reasonably charged to customers through base rates rather than through fuel charges, but the report did not suggest that customers should not have paid for those costs. In November 2009 the MPSC also retained another firm to review processes and practices related to fuel and purchased energy. The results of that review are due to the MPSC in March 2010. 

In January 2010 the MPSC issued an order certifying to the Mississippi Legislature the independent audit report and the Public Utilities Staff's annual fuel audit report for the years ended September 30, 2008 and 2009, which did not find any imprudent costs. The order stated that the MPSC will open a rulemaking docket to address certain policy issues regarding allowable fuel adjustment costs, fuel adjustment mechanisms, and related matters. 

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint 

The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general's suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court. In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general's complaint.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Mississippi's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi's financial position or results of operations. 

332 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy's reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2009 was $3.4 million. Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to be $7.3 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $5.8 million to its qualified pension plans in 2009 and anticipates that it will contribute approximately $17.8 million in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Mississippi's pension contributions in the future. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Mississippi in 2009 were $6.5 million, including $1.6 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $5.0 million, including $1.6 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010.

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income decreased $3.9 million primarily due to lower net revenue and lower other income, partially offset by lower interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income increased $10.4 million primarily due to higher net revenue, lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by lower other income and higher taxes other than income taxes. 

Net Revenue 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The effect of rate case settlement variance results from the April 2009 settlement of Entergy New Orleans’ rate case, and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the operation of Grand Gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates effective June 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

The price applied to unbilled sales variance results from a decline in natural gas and purchased power prices. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the service territory, and more favorable weather in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Entergy New Orleans estimates that approximately 150,000 electric customers and 96,000 gas customers have returned since Hurricane Katrina and are taking service as of December 31, 2009, compared to approximately 141,000 electric customers and 93,000 gas customers as of December 31, 2008. Billed retail electricity usage increased a total of 238 GWh compared to the same period in 2008, an increase of 5.3%. 

342 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $107.5 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates offset by higher electricity usage;    

  ·    a decrease of $74.8 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales; and    

  ·    a decrease of $37 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues.    

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by an increase in demand. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2008 to 2007. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is due to an increase in electricity usage in the service territory in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Entergy New Orleans estimates that approximately 141,000 electric customers and 93,000 gas customers have returned since Hurricane Katrina and are taking service as of December 31, 2008, compared to approximately 132,000 electric customers and 86,000 gas customers as of December 31, 2007. Billed retail electricity usage increased a total of 184 GWh compared to the same period in 2007, an increase of 4%. 

The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in base rates in March and November 2007. Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the base rate increase. 

The rider revenue variance is due primarily to higher total revenue and a storm reserve rider effective March 2007 as a result of the City Council's approval of a settlement agreement in October 2006. The approved storm reserve has been set to collect $75 million over a ten-year period through the rider and the funds will be held in a restricted escrow account. The settlement agreement is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

The base revenue variance is primarily due to a base rate recovery credit, effective January 2008. The base rate credit is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $58.9 million in gross wholesale revenue due to increased sales to affiliated customers and an increase in the average price of energy available for resale sales;    

  ·    an increase of $47.7 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased electricity usage; and    

343 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    an increase of $22 million in gross gas revenues due to higher fuel recovery revenues and increases in gas base rates in March 2007 and November 2007.    

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power in addition to an increase in demand. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate earned on money pool investments. 

Interest and other charges decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate on notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization, as described more fully in Note 18 to the financial statements. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a provision for storm-related bad debts of $11 million recorded in 2007;    

  ·    a decrease of $6.2 million in legal and professional fees;    

  ·    a decrease of $3.4 million in employee benefit expenses; and    

  ·    a decrease of $1.9 million in gas operations spending due to higher labor and material costs for reliability work in 2007.    

The decrease was partially offset by: 

  ·    an increase of $3 million due to the accrual of Energy Efficiency and Economic Development Funds;    

  ·    an increase of $3 million in outside regulatory consultant fees; and    

  ·    an increase of $2.7 million in loss reserves primarily due to the implementation of the storm reserve rider in March 2007. The storm reserve rider is discussed above under "Net Revenue."    

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to higher franchise taxes in 2008 as a result of higher revenues. 

Other income decreased due to a reduction in the allowance for equity funds used during construction related to a decrease in storm-related construction and lower carrying costs due to the reduction of the Hurricane Katrina storm costs regulatory asset. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 33.6%, 39.7%, and 35.5%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate. 

Hurricane Katrina 

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to Entergy New Orleans' service territory, including the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the New Orleans area. The storms and flooding resulted in power outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation and gas infrastructure; and the loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations and the destruction of homes and businesses. Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs. Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance, obtaining assistance through federal legislation for damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and pursuing recovery through existing or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and the City Council.

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) 

In December 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included CDBG funding (for the states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) that allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery priorities. In March 2007, the City Council certified that Entergy New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006 that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan, and certified Entergy New Orleans' estimated costs of $465 million for its gas system rebuild (which is discussed below). Entergy New Orleans received $180.8 million of CDBG funds in 2007. 

Insurance Claims 

Entergy has received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers. Of the $317 million received, $206 million was allocated to Entergy New Orleans. Entergy has substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 

Rate and Storm-related Riders Filings 

See "Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders" below for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans' June 2006 formula rate plan filings and request to implement two storm-related riders filed with the City Council. 

Gas System Rebuild 

In addition to the Hurricane Katrina storm restoration costs that Entergy New Orleans incurred, Entergy New Orleans expects that over a longer term rebuilding of the gas system in New Orleans will be necessary due to the massive salt water intrusion into the system caused by the flooding in New Orleans. The salt water intrusion is expected to shorten the life of the gas system, making it necessary to rebuild portions of that system over time, earlier than otherwise would be expected. Entergy New Orleans currently expects the cost to rebuild the gas system to be $465 million, with the project extending many years into the future. Entergy New Orleans received insurance proceeds for future construction expenditures associated with rebuilding its gas system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution approving the settlement of Entergy New Orleans' rate and storm-cost recovery filings requires Entergy New Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated sub-account of other deferred credits until the proceeds are spent on the rebuild project. This other deferred credit is shown as "Gas system rebuild insurance proceeds" on Entergy New Orleans' balance sheet. 

Bankruptcy Proceedings 

As a result of the effects of Hurricane Katrina and the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the New Orleans area, on September 23, 2005, Entergy New Orleans filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court seeking reorganization relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On May 7, 2007, the bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization. With the receipt of CDBG funds, and the agreement on insurance recovery with one of its excess insurers, Entergy New Orleans waived the conditions precedent in its plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on May 8, 2007. Following are significant terms in Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization: 

  ·    Entergy New Orleans paid in full, in cash, the allowed third-party prepetition accounts payable (approximately $29 million, including interest). Entergy New Orleans paid interest from September 23, 2005 at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest for 2005 (6%) and 2006 (8%), and at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest (9.5%) plus 1% for 2007 through the date of payment.    

  ·    Entergy New Orleans issued notes due in three years in satisfaction of its affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million, including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool. Entergy New Orleans included in the principal amount of the notes accrued interest from September 23, 2005 at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest for 2005 (6%) and 2006 (8%), and at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest plus 1% for 2007 through the date of issuance of the notes. Entergy New Orleans will pay interest on the notes from their date of issuance at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest plus 1%. The Louisiana judicial rate of interest is 9.5% for 2007, 8.5% for 2008, 5.5% for 2009, and 3.5% for 2010.    

345 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    Entergy New Orleans repaid in full, in cash, the outstanding borrowings under the debtor-in-possession credit agreement between Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Corporation (approximately $67 million).    

  ·    Entergy New Orleans' first mortgage bonds remain outstanding with their stated maturity dates and interest terms. Pursuant to an agreement with its first mortgage bondholders, Entergy New Orleans paid the first mortgage bondholders an amount equal to the one year of interest from the bankruptcy petition date that the bondholders had waived previously in the bankruptcy proceeding (approximately $12 million).    

  ·    Entergy New Orleans' preferred stock remains outstanding on its stated dividend terms, and Entergy New Orleans paid its unpaid preferred dividends in arrears (approximately $1 million).    

  ·    Litigation claims were generally unaltered, and are generally proceeding as if Entergy New Orleans had not filed for bankruptcy protection, with exceptions for certain claims.    

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Debtor-in-Possession Credit Facility 

On September 26, 2005, Entergy New Orleans, as borrower, and Entergy Corporation, as lender, entered into a debtor-in-possession credit facility to provide funding to Entergy New Orleans during its business restoration efforts. The credit facility provided for up to $200 million in loans. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was the average interest rate of borrowings outstanding under Entergy Corporation's revolving credit facility. With the confirmation of Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization in May 2007, Entergy New Orleans repaid to Entergy Corporation, in full, in cash, the $67 million of outstanding borrowings under the debtor-in-possession credit facility. 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $61.4 million in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the timing of collection of receivables from customers;    

  ·    income tax refunds of $22.1 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of $5.8 million in 2008; and    

  ·    increased recovery of deferred fuel costs.    

The increase was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors. 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $120.2 million in 2008 primarily due to the receipt of $180.8 million of CBDG funds in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease of $43.6 million in pension contributions and the timing of payments to vendors. 

346 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $50.1 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds received in 2009 as compared to 2008, partially offset by storm restoration spending in 2008 related to Hurricane Gustav. 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $68.7 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase in Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds in 2008 as compared to 2007 and money pool activity, partially offset by proceeds of $10 million related to the sale of a power plant in 2007. 

 Increases in Entergy New Orleans' receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans' receivable from the money pool increased by $12.4 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy's subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities increased $3.0 million primarily due to $32.9 million of dividends paid on common stock in 2009, partially offset by the redemption, at maturity, of $30 million of 3.875% Series First Mortgage Bonds in August 2008. 

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $22.1 million primarily due to the repayment of Entergy New Orleans' borrowings under the debtor-in-possession credit facility in 2007, partially offset by the redemption, at maturity, of $30 million of 3.875% Series First Mortgage Bonds in August 2008. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy New Orleans' capitalization is balanced between equity and debt as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and shareholders' equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy New Orleans uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans' financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy New Orleans requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans' planned construction and other capital investments and existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 

347 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $35 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy New Orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy New Orleans expects to make payments of approximately $59 million for the years 2010-2012 related to Hurricane Katrina restoration work and its gas rebuild project, of which $34 million is expected to be incurred in 2010. Also, Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $5.1 million to its pension plan and approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy New Orleans’ pension contributions in the future. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans reflects capital required to support existing business. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 and to the financial statements. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy New Orleans' sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand; and    

  ·    debt and preferred stock issuances.    

Entergy New Orleans may refinance or redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy New Orleans' receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. As discussed above in "Bankruptcy Proceedings", in 2007, Entergy New Orleans issued notes due in 2010 to satisfy its affiliate prepetition accounts payable, including its prepetition indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool of $37.2 million. 

Entergy New Orleans has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $100 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans' short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts authorized by the City Council, and the current authorization extends through August 2010. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders 

On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. On April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive settlement. The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion of the $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit to a permanent reduction and substantial realignment of Grand Gulf cost recovery from fuel to electric base rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009, with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes. A new three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1% benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point bandwidth. Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning. The formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions, plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure events. 

The rate case settlement also included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. In September 2009 the City Council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans. The rate settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. The programs are expected to begin in 2010. 

In June 2006, Entergy New Orleans made its annual formula rate plan filings with the City Council. The filings presented various alternatives to reflect the effect of Entergy New Orleans' lost customers and decreased revenue following Hurricane Katrina. The alternative that Entergy New Orleans recommended adjusts for lost customers and assumes that the City Council's June 2006 decision to allow recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment clause stays in place during the rate-effective period (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously recovered through base rates). 

349 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

At the same time as it made its formula rate plan filings, Entergy New Orleans also filed with the City Council a request to implement two storm-related riders. With the first rider, Entergy New Orleans sought to recover the electric and gas restoration costs that it had actually spent through March 31, 2006. Entergy New Orleans also proposed semiannual filings to update the rider for additional restoration spending and also to consider the receipt of CDBG funds or insurance proceeds that it may receive. With the second rider, Entergy New Orleans sought to establish a storm reserve to provide for the risk of another storm. 

In October 2006, the City Council approved a settlement agreement that resolved Entergy New Orleans' rate and storm-related rider filings by providing for phased-in rate increases, while taking into account with respect to storm restoration costs the anticipated receipt of CDBG funding as recommended by the Louisiana Recovery Authority. The settlement provided for a 0% increase in electric base rates through December 2007, with a $3.9 million increase implemented in January 2008. Recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment clause was continued. Gas base rates increased by $4.75 million in November 2006 and increased by an additional $1.5 million in March 2007 and an additional $4.75 million in November 2007. The settlement called for Entergy New Orleans to file a base rate case by July 31, 2008, which it did as discussed above. The settlement agreement discontinued the formula rate plan and the generation performance-based plan but permitted Entergy New Orleans to file an application to seek authority to implement formula rate plan mechanisms no sooner than six months following the effective date of the implementation of the base rates resulting from the July 31, 2008 base rate case. The settlement also authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider beginning in March 2007. These storm reserve funds will be held in a restricted escrow account. 

In January 2008, Entergy New Orleans voluntarily implemented a 6.15% base rate credit (the recovery credit) for electric customers, which returned approximately $11.3 million to electric customers in 2008. Entergy New Orleans was able to implement this credit because during 2007 the recovery of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina was occurring faster than expected in 2006 projections. In addition, Entergy New Orleans committed to set aside $2.5 million for an energy efficiency program focused on community education and outreach and weatherization of homes. 

In addition to rate proceedings, Entergy New Orleans' fuel costs recovered from customers are subject to regulatory scrutiny. Entergy New Orleans' electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. In June 2006 the City Council authorized the recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through Entergy New Orleans' fuel adjustment clause (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously recovered through base rates), and continued that authorization in approving the October 2006 formula rate plan filing settlement. Effective June 2009, the majority of Grand Gulf costs were realigned to base rates and are no longer flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. 

Entergy New Orleans' gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. In October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the gas cost collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season. The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the winter months.

Environmental Risks 

Entergy New Orleans' facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy New Orleans' financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans' financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy New Orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month, including fuel price. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Effective June 2009, Entergy New Orleans reclassified the fuel component of unbilled accounts receivable to deferred fuel and will no longer include the fuel component in the unbilled calculation, which is in accordance with regulatory treatment. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy's reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2009 was $1.7 million. Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to be $3.6 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $1.1 million in qualified pension contributions in 2009 and anticipates approximately a $5.1 million pension contribution in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy New Orleans’ pension contributions in the future. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy New Orleans in 2009 were $5.9 million, including $1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $5.2 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010.

ENTERGY TEXAS, INC. 

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas 

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Management believes that the jurisdictional separation will better align Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve. The jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity. 

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31, 2007. Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt, which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of which $168 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2009. The pro rata share of the long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation. Entergy Texas' debt assumption does not discharge Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's liability for the long-term debt. To secure its debt assumption obligations, Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana a first lien on Entergy Texas' assets that were previously subject to the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. mortgage. Entergy Texas has until December 31, 2010 to repay the assumed debt. In addition, Entergy Texas, as the owner of Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC ("EGSRF I"), will report the $329.5 million of senior secured transition bonds ("securitization bonds") issued by EGSRF I as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet. The securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas. 

Entergy Texas will purchase from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend's nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant's output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will purchase a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas will purchase a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. The PPAs associated with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when retail open access commences in Entergy Texas' jurisdiction or when the unit(s) is no longer dispatched by the Entergy System. If Entergy Texas implements retail open access, it will terminate its participation in the System Agreement, except for the portion of the System Agreement related to transmission equalization. The dispatch and operation of the generating plants will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation. 

Because the jurisdictional separation was a transaction involving entities under common control, Entergy Texas recognized the assets and liabilities allocated to it at their carrying amounts in the accounts of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. at the time of the jurisdictional separation. Entergy Texas' financial statements report results of operations for 2007 as though the jurisdictional separation had occurred at the beginning of 2007, and presents its 2007 other financial information as of the beginning of 2007 as though the assets and liabilities had been allocated at that date. Financial statements and financial information presented for prior periods have also been presented on that basis to furnish comparative information.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased by $5.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses and higher interest and other charges. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income decreased $1 million primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses and lower other income, partially offset by lower interest and other charges and a lower effective income tax rate. 

Net Revenue 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate increases effective late-January 2009 and an Energy Efficiency rider which became effective December 31, 2008, which is substantially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate increases. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on billed and unbilled sales in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effects of Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to higher capacity revenue as a result of the purchased power agreements between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas and increased volume to municipal and co-op customers. 

As discussed further in Note 2 to the financial statements, the rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $18.6 million allocation of 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 2007. 

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to increased reserve equalization expense related to changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2008. 

361 

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $285.3 million in fuel cost recovery revenues primarily attributable to lower fuel rates and a decrease in affiliated wholesale revenue of $141.8 million due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel expense due to fuel and purchased power expense decreases in excess of lower fuel cost recovery revenues. 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to rough production cost equalization charges as described above. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2008 to 2007. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to decreased usage during the unbilled sales period. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for unbilled revenues. 

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to lower reserve equalization revenue related to changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2007. 

The securitization transition charge variance is primarily due to the issuance of securitization bonds. In June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds. 

The fuel recovery variance is primarily due to a reserve for potential rate refunds made in the first quarter 2007 as a result of a PUCT ruling related to the application of past PUCT rulings addressing transition to competition in Texas. 

The other variance is primarily caused by various operational effects of the jurisdictional separation on revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses.

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges 

Gross operating revenues increased $229.3 million primarily due to the following reasons: 

  ·    an increase of $157 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased usage, partially offset by interim fuel refunds to customers for fuel cost recovery over-collections through November 2007. The refund was distributed over a two-month period beginning February 2008. The interim refund and the PUCT approval is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements;    

  ·    an increase of $37.1 million in affiliated wholesale revenue primarily due to increases in the cost of energy;    

  ·    an increase in transition charge amounts collected from customers to service the securitization bonds as discussed above. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds; and    

  ·    implementation of an interim surcharge to collect $10.3 million in under-recovered incremental purchased capacity costs incurred through July 2007. The surcharge was collected over a two-month period beginning February 2008. The incremental capacity recovery rider and PUCT approval is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.    

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in power purchases as a result of the purchased power agreements between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas and an increase in the average market prices of purchased power and natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of decreased recovery from customers of fuel costs. 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to an increase of $6.9 million in the recovery of bond expenses related to the securitization bonds. The recovery became effective July 2007. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $11.4 million in fossil expenses primarily due to higher plant maintenance costs and plant outages;    

  ·    an increase of $6.8 million due to the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav storm cost recovery settlement agreement, as discussed below under "Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav";    

  ·    an increase of $1.8 million in transmission spending primarily for costs related to the Independent Coordinator of Transmission and substation maintenance;    

  ·    an increase of $1.8 million in local easement fees as the result of higher gross revenues in certain locations within the Texas jurisdiction; and    

  ·    an increase of $1.7 million in customer service costs primarily as a result of write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts.    

Other income increased primarily due to carrying charges on Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs as authorized by Texas legislation in the second quarter 2009, partially offset by a decrease in taxes collected on advances for transmission projects and a decrease in interest earned on money pool investments. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery filings. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding as a result of the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009 and the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009, partially offset by pay-down of debt assumption agreement liabilities. 

363 

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $4.7 million in transmission spending primarily due to lower transmission equalization expenses;    

  ·    a decrease of $3.9 million in plant maintenance costs; and    

  ·    a decrease of $3.6 million in customer service support costs, including a decrease in customer account write-offs.    

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.3 million due to the write-off of certain disallowed costs resulting from the December 2008 rate case settlement agreement filed with the PUCT and an increase of $1.7 in payroll and payroll-related costs. The rate case settlement agreement is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income decreased primarily due to the absence of carrying charges on storm restoration costs that were approved by the PUCT in the fourth quarter 2006 and a decrease in interest earned on money pool investments. In June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC issued securitization bonds and the carrying charges ended. The PUCT approval of carrying charges, the securitization filing and the approval for the recovery of reconstruction costs are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in taxes collected on advances for transmission projects. 

Interest and other charges decreased primarily due to the absence of interest recorded on advances from independent power producers per a FERC order during the first quarter 2007 and a decrease in debt outstanding under the debt assumption agreement. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest charges recorded on the securitization bonds which were issued during the second quarter 2007. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates were 36.6%, 32.7%, and 38.1% for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

364 

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $286.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the timing of collection of receivables from customers;    

  ·    increased recovery of deferred fuel costs. The increased fuel recovery was primarily caused by the $71 million fuel cost over-recovery refund in 2008 that is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in addition to the over-recovery of fuel costs in 2009 compared to 2008;    

  ·    income tax refunds of $72.3 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of $762 thousand in 2008; and    

  ·    a decrease of $15.3 million in pension contributions.    

The increase was partially offset by Hurricane Ike restoration spending in 2008. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $174.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to Hurricane Ike restoration spending, decreased recovery of deferred fuel costs, and an increase of $9.9 million in pension contributions, partially offset by the timing of collections of receivables from customers and payments to vendors. The decreased fuel recovery was primarily caused by the $71 million fuel cost over-recovery refund that is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in addition to the over-recovery of fuel costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to under-recovering for the year ended December 31, 2008. Fuel prices increased and due to the time lag before the fuel recovery rate increases in response, Entergy Texas had under-recovered fuel costs in 2008. 

Investing Activities 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $99.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to money pool activity, partially offset by higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Ike and insurance proceeds received in 2009 relating to Hurricane Ike. 

Increases in Entergy Texas' receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas' receivable from the money pool increased by $69.3 million in 2009 compared to decreasing by $154.2 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased $117.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to money pool activity, partially offset by an increase in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to Hurricane Ike. 

Decreases in Entergy Texas' receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas' receivable from the money pool decreased by $154.2 million for 2008 compared to increasing by $56.9 million for 2007. 

Financing Activities 

Financing activities provided cash of $127.6 million for 2009 compared to using cash of $179.4 million for 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds;    

  ·    the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series Mortgage Bonds in January 2009;    

  ·    the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series Mortgage Bonds in May 2009; and    

  ·    $150 million of capital returned to Entergy Corporation in February 2008. After the effects of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, Entergy Corporation made a $300 million capital contribution to Entergy Gulf States, Inc. in 2005, which was part of Entergy's financing plan that provided liquidity and capital resources to Entergy and its subsidiaries while storm restoration cost recovery was pursued.    

365 

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The cash provided was partially offset by: 

  ·    the retirement of $619.9 million of long term debt in 2009 compared to $327.5 million in 2008;    

  ·    the repayment of $100 million outstanding on Entergy Texas' credit facility in February 2009 as compared to borrowings of $100 million on Entergy Texas' credit facility in 2008;    

  ·    the repayment of Entergy Texas' $160 million note payable from Entergy Corporation in January 2009;    

  ·    an increase of $107.5 million in common stock dividends paid; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Decreases in Entergy Texas' payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas' payable to the money pool decreased by $50.8 million in 2009 compared to increasing by $50.8 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy's subsidiaries need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing activities used cash of $179.4 million for 2008 compared to providing cash of $278.7 million for 2007 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $329.5 million of securitization bonds in June 2007. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds;    

  ·    the retirement of $327.5 million of long-term debt in 2008; and    

  ·    $150 million of capital returned to Entergy Corporation in February 2008. After the effects of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, Entergy Corporation made a $300 million capital contribution to Entergy Gulf States, Inc. in 2005, which was part of Entergy's financing plan that provided liquidity and capital resources to Entergy and its subsidiaries while storm restoration cost recovery was pursued.    

The use of cash was partially offset by: 

  ·    borrowing $160 million from Entergy Corporation in December 2008;    

  ·    borrowings of $100 million on Entergy Texas' credit facility; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Increases in Entergy Texas' payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas' payable to the money pool increased by $50.8 million for 2008. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Texas' capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Texas as of December 31, 2009 is primarily due to the issuance of $500 million 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009, the issuance of $150 million 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009, and the issuance of $545.9 million senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) in November 2009 (which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas), partially offset by the repayment of Entergy Texas' $160 million note payable from Entergy Corporation in January 2009, the repayment of $100 million outstanding on Entergy Texas' credit facility in February 2009, and the retirement of $619.9 million of long-term debt prior to maturity. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion and also including the debt assumption liability. Capital consists of debt and shareholders' equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Texas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas' financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Texas requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt maturities, including payments under the debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas' planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $106 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $9.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $7.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Texas’ pension contributions in the future. 

Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Texas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Texas' sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Texas may refinance or redeem debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Texas' receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2009. 

Entergy Texas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas' short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Texas has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011. 

In December 2008, Entergy Texas borrowed $160 million from its parent company, Entergy Corporation, under a $300 million revolving credit facility pursuant to an Inter-Company Credit Agreement between Entergy Corporation and Entergy Texas. This borrowing would have matured on December 3, 2013. Entergy Texas used these borrowings, together with other available corporate funds, to pay at maturity the portion of the $350 million Floating Rate series of First Mortgage Bonds due December 2008 that had been assumed by Entergy Texas, and that bond series is no longer outstanding. In January 2009, Entergy Texas repaid its $160 million note payable to Entergy Corporation with the proceeds from the $500 million bond issuance discussed above. 

Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav 

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Texas' service territory. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Entergy Texas filed an application in April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, including estimated costs for work to be completed. On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in the storm cost recovery case. Under the terms of the agreement $566.4 million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery. Insurance proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount. Of the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas' request and the amount agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not directly attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in the second quarter 2009. The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as utility plant. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs, by securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization bonds. 

368 

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In the third quarter 2009, Entergy settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received $75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5 million). 

Hurricane Rita 

In September 2005, Hurricane Rita hit Entergy Texas' service territory. The storm resulted in power outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations. In July 2006, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT with respect to its Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs incurred through March 2006. The filing asked the PUCT to determine the amount of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs eligible for securitization and recovery, approve the recovery of carrying costs, and approve the manner in which Entergy Texas allocates those costs among its retail customer classes. In December 2006, the PUCT approved $381 million of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs incurred through March 31, 2006, plus carrying costs, as eligible for recovery. After netting expected insurance proceeds, the amount is $353 million. In April 2007, the PUCT issued its financing order authorizing the issuance of securitization bonds to recover the $353 million of hurricane reconstruction costs and up to $6 million of transaction costs, offset by $32 million of related deferred income tax benefits. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the June 2007 issuance of the securitization bonds. 

 Entergy received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers. Of the $317 million received, $34 million has been allocated to Entergy Texas. Entergy has substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Rita. 

Electric Industry Restructuring 

In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that requires Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas' transition to competition. The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining the Southwest Power Pool. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist. Under the new law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT's certification of Entergy Texas' power region. In response to the new law, Entergy Texas in June 2009 gave notice to the PUCT of the withdrawal of its previously filed transition to competition plan, and requested that its transition to competition proceeding be dismissed. In July 2009 the ALJ dismissed the proceeding. 

The new law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas to be included in a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas. 

The new law further amends already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the new law provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall "purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer"; and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service. The new law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction. The new law provides that the PUCT shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than September 1, 2010.

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Filings with the PUCT 

2009 Rate Case 

In December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $198.7 million increase reflecting an 11.5% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2009 test year. The filing includes a proposed cost of service adjustment rider with a three-year term beginning with the 2010 calendar year as the initial evaluation period. Key provisions include a plus or minus 15 basis point bandwidth, with earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the bottom or top of the band and rates changing prospectively depending upon whether Entergy Texas is under or over-earning. The annual change in revenue requirement is limited to a percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for urban areas, and the filing includes a provision for extraordinary events greater than $10 million per year that would be considered separately. The filing also proposes a purchased power recovery rider and a competitive generation service tariff, and will establish test year baseline values to be used in the transmission cost recovery factor rider authorized for use by Entergy Texas in the 2009 legislative session. The rate case also includes a $2.8 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which Entergy Texas retail customers are responsible, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also includes a request to reconcile $1.8 billion of fuel and purchased power costs covering the period April 2007 through June 2009. Hearings in the proceeding are scheduled for July 2010, and the PUCT is required to issue a final order by November 1, 2010. Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas will be allowed to implement a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to refund. The rates set by a final order will be effective back to September 13, 2010. 

2007 Rate Case 

Entergy Texas made a rate filing in September 2007 with the PUCT requesting an annual rate increase totaling $107.5 million, including a base rate increase of $64.3 million and riders totaling $43.2 million. On December 16, 2008, Entergy Texas filed a term sheet that reflected a settlement agreement that included the PUCT Staff and the other active participants in the rate case. On December 19, 2008, the ALJs approved Entergy Texas' request to implement interim rates reflecting the agreement. The agreement includes a $46.7 million base rate increase, among other provisions. Under the ALJs' interim order, Entergy Texas implemented interim rates, subject to refund and surcharge, reflecting the rates established through the settlement. These rates became effective with bills rendered on and after January 28, 2009, for usage on and after December 19, 2008. In addition, the existing recovery mechanism for incremental purchased power capacity costs ceased as of January 28, 2009, with purchased power capacity costs then subsumed within the base rates set in this proceeding. The agreement adopted by the PUCT also reconciles fuel and purchased power costs for the period January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. Certain Texas municipalities exercised their original jurisdiction and took final action to approve rates consistent with the interim rates approved by the ALJs. In March 2009, the PUCT approved the settlement, which made the interim rates final. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Texas' rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, not recovered in base rates. The fixed fuel factor formula was revised and approved by a PUCT order in August 2006. The new formula was implemented in September 2006. Under the new methodology, semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor will continue to be made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas' fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. 

In July 2005, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request for implementation of an incremental purchased capacity recovery rider. Through this rider Entergy Texas sought to recover incremental revenues that represent the incremental purchased capacity costs, including Entergy Texas' obligation to purchase power from Entergy Louisiana's Perryville plant, over what is already in Entergy Texas' base rates. The PUCT approved an initial rider to collect $18 million annually, which was increased to $21 million in subsequent years. Under the 

370 

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

settlement of the 2007 rate case discussed above, this rider ceased on January 28, 2009, with the implementation of stipulated base rates. The amounts collected through the rider are subject to reconciliation. 

In May 2006, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a fuel and purchased power reconciliation case covering the period September 2003 through December 2005 for costs recoverable through the fixed fuel factor rate and the incremental purchased capacity recovery rider. Entergy Texas sought reconciliation of $1.6 billion of fuel and purchased power costs on a Texas retail basis. A hearing was conducted before the ALJs in April 2007. In July 2007, the ALJs issued a proposal for decision recommending that Entergy Texas be authorized to reconcile all of its requested fixed fuel factor expenses and recommending a minor exception to the incremental purchased capacity recovery calculation. The ALJs also recommended granting an exception to the PUCT rules to allow for recovery of an additional $11.4 million in purchased power capacity costs. In September 2007, the PUCT issued an order, which affirmed the ultimate result of the ALJs' proposal for decision. Upon motions for rehearing, the PUCT added additional language in its order on rehearing to further clarify its position that 30% of River Bend should not be regulated by the PUCT. Two parties filed a second motion for rehearing, but the PUCT declined to address them. The PUCT's decision has been appealed to the Travis County District Court. 

In March 2007, Entergy Texas filed a request with the PUCT to refund $78.5 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through January 2007. In June 2007 the PUCT approved a unanimous stipulation and settlement agreement that updated the over-collection balance through April 2007 and established a refund amount, including interest, of $109.4 million. The refund was made over a two-month period beginning with the first billing cycle in July 2007. 

In October 2007, Entergy Texas filed a request with the PUCT to refund $45.6 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2007. In January 2008, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a stipulation and settlement agreement among the parties that updated the over-collection balance through November 2007 and established a refund amount, including interest, of $71 million. The PUCT approved the agreement in February 2008. The refund was made over a two-month period beginning February 2008, but was reduced by $10.3 million of under-recovered incremental purchased capacity costs. 

In January 2008, Entergy Texas made a compliance filing with the PUCT describing how its 2007 Rough Production Cost Equalization receipts under the System Agreement were allocated between Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. A hearing was held at the end of July 2008, and in October 2008 the ALJ issued a proposal for decision recommending an additional $18.6 million allocation to Texas retail customers. The PUCT adopted the ALJ's proposal for decision in December 2008. Because the PUCT allocation to Texas retail customers is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to Louisiana retail customers, the PUCT's decision would result in trapped costs between the Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions with no mechanism for recovery. The PUCT denied Entergy Texas' motion for rehearing and Entergy Texas commenced proceedings in both state and federal district courts seeking to reverse the PUCT's decision. The federal proceeding has been abated pending further action by the FERC in the proceeding discussed below. No procedural schedule has been set for the state proceeding. 

Entergy Texas also filed with the FERC a proposed amendment to the System Agreement bandwidth formula to specifically calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost equalization receipts for 2007. On May 8, 2009, the FERC issued an order rejecting the proposed amendment, stating, among other things, that the FERC does not have jurisdiction over the allocation of an individual utility's receipts/payments among or between its retail jurisdictions and that this was a matter for the courts to review in the pending proceedings noted above. Because of the FERC's order, Entergy Texas recorded the effects of the PUCT's allocation of the additional $18.6 million to retail customers in the second quarter 2009. On an after-tax basis, the charge to earnings was approximately $13.0 million (including interest). Entergy requested rehearing of the FERC's order, and on July 8, 2009, the FERC granted the request for rehearing for the limited purpose of affording more time for consideration of Entergy's request.

Entergy Texas, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In May 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a four-month period beginning June 2009. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through March 2009. The refund was made over a three-month period beginning July 2009, with the exception of certain industrial and seasonal/agricultural customers who received a one-month refund. 

In October 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $71 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a six-month period beginning January 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $87.8 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through October 2009. The refund will be made over a three-month period beginning January 2010, with the exception of certain industrial and seasonal/agricultural customers who received a one-month refund.

Transmission 

See "Independent Coordinator of Transmission" in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries' Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. 

Industrial and Commercial 

Entergy Texas' large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas' industrial customer base. Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Texas does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Texas' marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Texas' facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Texas' financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas' financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Texas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy's reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries' Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension income for Entergy Texas in 2009 was $0.8 million. Entergy Texas anticipates 2010 qualified pension expense to be $3 million. Entergy Texas contributed $3.6 million to its qualified pension plans in 2009. Entergy Texas' contributions to the pension trust are currently estimated to be approximately $9.7 million in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Texas’ pension contributions in the future. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Texas in 2009 were $5.7 million, including $1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $5.6 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $7.7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC. 

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

System Energy's principal asset currently consists of a 90% ownership and leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy's only source of operating revenues. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income decreased $42.2 million primarily due to an increase in the effective income tax rate. 

An increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction, primarily due to the new nuclear development project discussed below, was offset by a decrease in interest income, primarily on money pool investments. 

2008 Compared to 2007 

Net income decreased $45.0 million primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate, a decrease in rate base in 2008 that resulted in lower operating income, and lower interest income. The lower interest income resulted from a decrease in interest earned on money pool investments and from $2.5 million in interest income recorded on an IRS audit settlement in 2007. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 66.5%, 39.5%, and 25.0%, respectively. The increase in the rate for 2009 is primarily due to the reallocation of Entergy Corporation consolidated tax benefits based on the resolution of IRS audits of prior tax years. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate and for a discussion of the IRS audits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

382 

System Energy Resources, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Activities 

Cash flow from operations increased by $199.4 million in 2009 primarily due to income tax refunds of $120.4 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of $54.4 million in 2008. 

Cash flow from operations decreased by $3.4 million in 2008 primarily due to lower net income substantially offset by a decrease of $30.7 million in income tax payments. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $52.4 million in cash flow in 2009 primarily due to money pool activity. Increases in System Energy's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy's receivable from the money pool increased by $47.6 million in 2009 compared to decreasing by $10.7 million in 2008. The money pool is an intercompany borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $17.0 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease of $21.8 million in common stock dividends paid. 

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $31.2 million in 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $34 million in common stock dividends paid. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

System Energy's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common shareholder's equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy's financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

System Energy requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.

System Energy Resources, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Following are the amounts of System Energy's planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (2)   It is expected that additional financing under the lease will be arranged as needed to acquire additional fuel, to pay interest, and to pay maturing debt. If such additional financing cannot be arranged, however, System Energy must repurchase sufficient nuclear fuel to allow the lessor to meet its obligations.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to contribute approximately $12.5 million to its pension plans and approximately $3.4 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010. Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of System Energy’s pension contributions in the future. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $168.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for System Energy reflects capital required to support the existing business of System Energy. The estimate also includes the costs of System Energy's planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. The project is currently expected to cost $575 million, including transmission upgrades. On November 30, 2009, the MPSC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for implementation of the uprate. 

System Energy has also invested, through its subsidiary Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, in initial development costs for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf and River Bend sites, including licensing and design activities. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In addition, Entergy temporarily suspended reviews of the two license applications for the sites and will explore alternative nuclear technologies for this project. As of December 31, 2009, $100.3 million in construction work in progress was recorded on System Energy's balance sheet related to this project. In the first quarter 2010 this construction work in progress was transferred to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi. 

Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Currently, all of System Energy's retained earnings are available for distribution. 

384 

System Energy Resources, Inc. 

Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Sources of Capital 

System Energy's sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

System Energy may refinance or redeem debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common stock issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

System Energy has obtained a short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow, through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy's short-term borrowing limits. System Energy has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances. The current long-term authorization extends through July 2011. 

System Energy's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In May 2007, $22.5 million of System Energy's receivable from the money pool was replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Nuclear Matters 

System Energy owns and operates Grand Gulf. System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 

Environmental Risks 

System Energy's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
