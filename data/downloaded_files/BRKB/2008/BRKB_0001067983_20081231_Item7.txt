Results of Operations  

Net earnings for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and minority interests and are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Berkshires operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshires corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshires corporate office management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  

During 2008, a series of crises occurred in the U.S. financial and capital markets systems, as well as in the credit and housing markets. These conditions accelerated into an economic recession, as evidenced by declining consumer confidence, lower consumer spending, bankruptcies and significant job losses. The declining economic conditions worsened over the last half of 2008 and in the fourth quarter in particular. Equity and debt markets have seen major declines in market prices on a worldwide basis as well, which have negatively impacted the fair value of Berkshires investments and derivative contracts. During 2008, the net after-tax unrealized gains in Berkshires equity investment portfolio declined by approximately $13.9 billion. In addition, during 2008, after-tax investment and derivative losses of $4.6 billion were included in earnings and primarily related to non-cash fair value adjustments of certain derivative contract liabilities and non-cash other-than-temporary impairment charges with respect to certain investments offset to a degree by net realized gains from investment sales.  

Berkshires insurance, manufacturing, service, retailing and finance and financial products businesses were impacted by the recession in different ways and to varying degrees. Operating results in 2008 for most of Berkshires manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were generally lower than in 2007. It is likely that the current economic conditions will persist through 2009 and in to 2010 before meaningful improvements become evident. Berkshires operating companies have taken and will continue to take cost reduction actions in response to the current economic situation, including curtailing production, reducing capital expenditures, closing facilities and reducing employment to partially compensate for the declines in demand for goods and services. Berkshire has historically attempted to manage its financial condition such that it can weather cyclical economic conditions. Management believes that the economic franchises of Berkshires business operations will remain intact and that operating results will ultimately return to more normal historical levels.  

InsuranceUnderwriting  

Berkshire engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, Berkshire subsidiaries assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Berkshires principal insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Through General Re, Berkshire also reinsures life and health risks.  

Berkshires management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing, with limited exceptions, is the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, Berkshire evaluates performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income.

InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued)  

Periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. Berkshires property and casualty reinsurance operations benefited from relatively minor levels of catastrophe losses in 2007 and 2006. During 2008, Berkshires underwriting results include estimated losses of approximately $900 million from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The impact on earnings of these losses was substantially offset by unrealized foreign currency transaction gains during the last half of 2008 that arose from the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities as a result of the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar.  

A key marketing strategy followed by all of the insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of Berkshires insurance businesses was approximately $51 billion at December 31, 2008. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Additional information regarding Berkshires insurance and reinsurance operations follows.  

A summary follows of underwriting results from Berkshires insurance businesses for the past three years. Amounts are in millions.

GEICO  

GEICO provides primarily private passenger automobile coverages to insureds in 49 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet, over the telephone or through the mail. This is a significant element in GEICOs strategy to be a low-cost insurer. In addition, GEICO strives to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships.  

GEICOs underwriting results for the past three years are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.

GEICO (Continued)  

Premiums earned in 2008 increased 5.7% over 2007, reflecting an 8.2% increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force partially offset by lower average premiums per policy. Average premiums per policy declined during 2007 but leveled off in 2008. The weakening economy could result in downward pressure on average premiums per policy in 2009 to the extent that consumers raise deductibles and reduce coverages to save money. Policies-in-force over the last twelve months increased 6.6% in the preferred risk auto line and increased 13.1% in the standard and nonstandard auto lines. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2008 increased 2.0% compared to 2007. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2008 were 665,000 higher than at December 31, 2007.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2008 increased 9.5% over 2007. The loss ratio was 74.8% in 2008 versus 72.2% in 2007. Incurred losses from catastrophe events for 2008 were $87 million compared to $34 million for 2007. Overall, the increase in the loss ratio reflected higher average claim severities and lower average premiums per policy, partially offset by lower average claims frequencies. Claims frequencies in 2008 for physical damage coverages decreased in the seven to nine percent range from 2007 and frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the four to six percent range. Physical damage severities in 2008 increased in the six to eight percent range and injury severities increased in the five to eight percent range over 2007.  

Underwriting expenses in 2008 increased $61 million (2.8%) over 2007. Policy acquisition expenses increased 8.5% in 2008 to $1,508 million, primarily due to increased advertising and policy issuance costs. The increase in policy acquisition expenses was partially offset by lower other underwriting expenses, including lower interest on deferred compensation liabilities.  

Premiums earned in 2007 increased 6.8% over 2006, due to higher numbers of policies-in-force, partially offset by lower premiums per policy as a result of overall lower rates. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2007 increased 10.0% over 2006, reflecting the aforementioned decline in average premiums per policy. In 2007, claims frequencies for physical damage coverages increased in the two to four percent range over 2006 while frequencies for injury coverages decreased in the three to five percent range. Physical damage severities increased in the second half of 2007 at an annualized rate of two to four percent. Injury severities also increased in the latter part of 2007 at an annualized rate of three to six percent.  

General Re  

General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. Property and casualty reinsurance is written in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Cologne Re (based in Germany) and other affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written worldwide through Cologne Re. General Re strives to generate underwriting gains in essentially all of its product lines. Underwriting performance is not evaluated based upon market share and underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Res underwriting results are summarized for the past three years in the following table. Amounts are in millions.

General Re (Continued)  

Property/casualty  

Premiums written in 2008 declined 2.7% from 2007, which declined 2.9% versus 2006. Premiums written in 2008 included $205 million with respect to a reinsurance-to-close transaction that increased General Res economic interest in the runoff of Lloyds Syndicate 435s 2000 year of account from 39% to 100%. A similar transaction in 2007 generated $114 million of premiums written and increased General Res economic interest in the runoff of Lloyds Syndicate 435s 2001 year of account from 60% to 100%. Neither of the reinsurance-to-close transactions had any impact on net underwriting results because premiums earned were offset by corresponding increases to loss reserves and losses incurred. There was no similar transaction in 2006.  

Premiums earned in 2008 declined 5.0% from 2007, which declined 2.6% from 2006. Excluding the effects of the previously mentioned reinsurance-to-close transactions and exchange rates, premiums earned declined 8.2% in 2008 compared to 2007 and 10.1% in 2007 compared to 2006. The overall comparative declines in written and earned premiums reflect continued underwriting discipline by declining to accept business where pricing is considered inadequate with respect to the risk. Competitive conditions currently prevailing within the industry could lead to continued declines in business written in 2009.  

Pre-tax underwriting results in 2008 included $275 million in underwriting gains from property business partially offset by $112 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting losses of $120 million for the 2008 accident year, offset by $395 million of gains from favorable run-off of prior years losses. The current accident year results include $174 million of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $56 million of catastrophe losses from European storms. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business in 2008 included $117 million of workers compensation loss reserve discount accretion and retroactive reinsurance deferred charge amortization, offset in part by favorable run-off in other casualty lines. The casualty results were adversely impacted by legal costs incurred in connection with the ongoing regulatory investigations of finite reinsurance.  

Pre-tax underwriting results in 2007 included $519 million in underwriting gains from property business, partially offset by $44 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business. The property business produced underwriting gains of $90 million for the 2007 accident year and $429 million from favorable run-off of prior years losses. The pre-tax underwriting losses from casualty business in 2007 included $120 million of loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, as well as legal costs associated with the finite reinsurance investigations. These charges were largely offset by underwriting gains in other casualty business.  

Pre-tax underwriting results in 2006 included $708 million in underwriting gains from property business, partially offset by $335 million in underwriting losses from casualty/workers compensation business, which included legal and estimated settlement costs associated with the finite reinsurance regulatory investigations. The 2006 property results benefited from a lack of catastrophe losses and favorable runoff of prior years claim reserves. The underwriting losses from casualty business in 2006 included $137 million in reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization, increases in prior years workers compensation reserves of $103 million and increases in asbestos and environmental reserves.  

Life/health  

Premiums earned in 2008 increased 4.8% over 2007, which increased 4.1% over 2006. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned increased 2.2% over 2007 which were relatively unchanged when compared to 2006. The increase in premiums earned in 2008 was primarily from life business in North America. Underwriting results for the life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains in each of the past three years driven by gains from the life business primarily as a result of lower mortality rates.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  

The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRGs business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess direct and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual discrete property risks referred to as individual risk. Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line refers to other business written on both a quota-share and excess basis, participations in and contracts with Lloyds syndicates as well as property, aviation and workers compensation programs. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification, often several hundred million dollars and occasionally in excess of $1 billion, and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property risks (such as aviation and aerospace, commercial multi-peril or terrorism). The timing and magnitude of losses produce extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of BHRGs catastrophe and individual risk business. BHRG does not cede these risks to mitigate volatility as management accepts such potential volatility provided that the long-term prospect of achieving underwriting profits is reasonable.  

Premiums earned from catastrophe and individual risk contracts in 2008 declined 39% from 2007, which decreased 28% versus 2006. Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were approximately $1.1 billion in 2008, $1.2 billion in 2007 and $2.4 billion in 2006. The decreases in premium volume were principally attributable to increased industry capacity for catastrophe reinsurance, which has produced increased price competition and fewer opportunities to write business at prices considered adequate by BHRG management. The level of catastrophe and individual risk business written in a given period will vary significantly based upon market conditions and managements assessment of the adequacy of premium rates.  

During 2008, Berkshire entered into a contract under which it received a payment of $224 million and agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $4 billion of revenue bonds issued by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation. Berkshires obligation was conditioned upon, among other things, the occurrence of a specified amount of hurricane losses in Florida during a period that expired on December 31, 2008. The minimum amount of hurricane losses required to trigger Berkshires acquisition of the bonds was not met and the consideration received was earned as of December 31, 2008 and is included in the underwriting results of the catastrophe and individual risk business.  

Underwriting results in 2008 for the catastrophe and individual risk business also included approximately $270 million of estimated losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The underwriting results from catastrophe and individual risk business in 2007 and 2006 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events occurring in those years. In 2006, BHRG incurred losses of approximately $200 million attributable to prior years events, primarily Hurricane Wilma which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005.  

Retroactive policies normally provide very large, but limited indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events that are expected to be paid over long periods of time. Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance include the amortization of deferred charges established on the contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charges represent the difference between the premium received and the estimated ultimate losses payable. Deferred charges are amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method. The amortization charges are based on the estimated timing and amount of loss payments and are recorded as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses.  

Premiums earned from retroactive reinsurance in 2007 included $7.1 billion from the Equitas reinsurance agreement which became effective on March 30, 2007. See Note 13 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Otherwise,

 premiums earned from retroactive contracts were relatively minor over the past three years. Unamortized deferred charges of BHRGs retroactive contracts (including the Equitas contract) were $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007. Gross unpaid losses under retroactive contracts were approximately $16.6 billion at December 31, 2008 and $17.3 billion at December 31, 2007.  

Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance policies in each year were primarily attributable to recurring deferred charge amortization. Underwriting losses from retroactive policies in 2007 included deferred charge amortization of $156 million on contracts written in 2007 (primarily the Equitas contract). Underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in 2006 were net of gains of approximately $145 million which primarily derived from contracts that were commuted or amended during that year.  

Other multi-line premiums earned in 2008 increased $1.31 billion (50%) over 2007. Premiums earned in 2008 included $1.83 billion from a quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. and its major property/casualty affiliates (Swiss Re) that became effective January 1, 2008. Under the agreement, BHRG assumes a 20% quota-share of the premiums and related losses and expenses on substantially all property/casualty risks of Swiss Re written over the five year period ending December 31, 2012. BHRGs written premium under this agreement in 2008 was $2.65 billion. Actual premiums assumed over the remainder of the five year period could vary significantly depending on Swiss Res response to market conditions and opportunities that arise over the contract term. Excluding the premiums from the Swiss Re quota-share contract, other multi-line premiums earned in 2008 declined 20% versus 2007 principally attributable to lower premium volume from workers compensation programs.  

Other multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $962 million in 2008. This gain included $930 million of foreign currency transaction gains (including approximately $615 million in the fourth quarter) arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance liabilities denominated and settled in foreign currencies (primarily the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro) into U.S. Dollars as of the balance sheet date. The value of these currencies versus the U.S. Dollar generally increased over the past several years resulting in accumulated liabilities and transaction losses. Over the last half of 2008, these currencies declined sharply versus the U.S. Dollar, resulting in gains that exceeded the previously recorded losses.  

Excluding the effects of the currency gains/losses, other multi-line business produced a pre-tax underwriting gain of $32 million in 2008 compared to $435 million in 2007. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2008 included approximately $435 million of estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. There were no significant catastrophe losses in 2007, which also benefited from relatively low property loss ratios and favorable loss experience on workers compensation business.  

Other multi-line premiums earned in 2007 were relatively unchanged from 2006, reflecting significant increases in property business and significant decreases in casualty excess reinsurance. In addition, as of the beginning of 2007, the management of certain workers compensation business was transferred to the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and the related underwriting results have been excluded from BHRG since that date.  

In December 2007, BHRG formed a monoline financial guarantee insurance company, Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation (BHAC). BHAC commenced operations during the first quarter of 2008 and is licensed in 49 states. As of December 31, 2008, BHAC had approximately $1 billion in capital and has received the highest rating available from two credit rating agencies. BHRG is pursuing opportunities to write financial guarantee insurance on municipal bonds. In its first year of operation, BHAC produced $595 million of written premiums. The impact of this new business on 2008 underwriting results was minimal, since the coverage periods related to the insured bonds extend over 40 years into the future.  

In January 2009, BHRG agreed to cover certain Swiss Re entities for adverse loss development of its property and casualty loss reserves up to 5 billion Swiss Francs in excess of its December 31, 2008 loss reserves less 2 billion Swiss Francs. BHRG will receive a premium of 2 billion Swiss Francs for providing this coverage.

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  

Berkshires primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Corporation (MedPro), a provider of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Companys primary group operation (NICO Primary Group), a writer of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as Homestate operations, providers of standard commercial multi-line insurance; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., (acquired in August 2007) which writes insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft.  

Earned premiums by the primary insurance businesses were $1,950 million in 2008, $1,999 million in 2007 and $1,858 million in 2006. Roughly 33% of the premiums earned in each year were from MedPro. In 2008, premiums earned by the NICO Primary Group declined by approximately 30%, which was partially offset by increased premiums earned from the Homestate operations and BoatU.S. Pre-tax underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 11% in 2008, 14% in 2007 and 18% in 2006. The decline in underwriting gains in 2008 from 2007 reflected declines in underwriting gains from the NICO Primary Group and Homestate operations, which were primarily due to less favorable loss reserve development of prior years occurrences as well as relatively higher losses for current year occurrences.  

InsuranceInvestment Income  

A summary of the net investment income of Berkshires insurance operations for the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments and dividends earned on equity investments. Pre-tax investment income earned in 2008 was relatively unchanged from 2007. Investment income earned in 2007 increased $442 million (10%) over 2006. The increase in 2007 over 2006 reflected increased invested assets, higher short-term interest rates in the United States and increased dividend rates on certain equity investments.  

In 2008, dividend income increased $534 million, reflecting increased investments in equity securities and increased dividend rates with respect to certain securities. The increase in dividends earned was offset by a decline in interest earned, reflecting lower levels of related fixed maturity investments and generally lower interest rates applicable to cash equivalents and short-term investments. In October 2008, Berkshire subsidiaries acquired the Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric securities for an aggregate cost of $14.5 billion. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and dividends from these securities will be approximately $1.4 billion per annum, which is substantially greater than earnings currently expected from short-term investments.

 * Other investments include the investments in Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric as well as investments in Burlington Northern and Moodys, which as of December 31, 2008 are accounted for under the equity method. In 2007 and 2006, investments in Burlington Northern and Moodys are included in equity securities.  

Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2008 were as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

All U.S. government obligations are rated AAA by the major rating agencies and approximately 90% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities that are rated below BBB- or Baa3.  

Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $58 billion at December 31, 2008, $59 billion at December 31, 2007 and $51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in float in 2007 was principally due to the Equitas reinsurance transaction. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as Berkshires insurance businesses generated underwriting gains in each year.

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican)  

Revenues and earnings of MidAmerican for each of the past three years are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes).  

 ** Net of $58 million deferred income tax benefit in 2007 as a result of the reduction in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 30% to 28% which was enacted during the third quarter of 2007 and became effective in 2008.  

Berkshire currently owns an 88.2% (87.4% diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican), an international energy company. MidAmericans domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies (MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC) and PacifiCorp) serving over 3 million retail customers and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies (Northern Natural Gas and Kern River) with approximately 17,000 miles of pipeline in operation and design capacity of about 7.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. In the United Kingdom (U.K.), electricity distribution subsidiaries serve about 3.8 million electricity end users. The rates that MidAmericans utilities, electricity distribution and natural gas pipeline businesses may charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmericans other businesses include a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States.  

MECs revenues in 2008 increased $417 million (10%) over 2007. The increase reflects (1) increased regulated natural gas revenues from cost based price increases that are largely passed on to customers, (2) increased non-regulated gas revenues due primarily to higher prices and, to a lesser degree, increased volume and (3) increased wholesale regulated electricity revenues driven by volume increases. Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (EBIT) of MEC in 2008 increased $13 million (3%) versus 2007, resulting primarily from higher operating margins on wholesale regulated electricity and slightly higher margins from regulated gas sales, partially offset by increased interest expense and lower miscellaneous income.  

PacifiCorps revenues in 2008 increased $239 million (6%) over 2007. The increase was primarily related to higher retail revenues due to regulator approved rate increases as well as increased customer growth and usage. PacifiCorps EBIT in 2008 increased $11 million (2%) versus 2007, as higher revenues were substantially offset by increased fuel costs and interest expense.

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican) (Continued)  

Natural gas pipelines revenues in 2008 increased $133 million (12%) over 2007. The increase reflected increased transportation revenue as a result of stronger market conditions in the Northern Natural Gas system, the impact of system expansion projects and changes related to the Kern River system current rate proceeding. EBIT in 2008 of the gas pipeline businesses increased $122 million (26%) over 2007. The increase in EBIT reflects the impact of increased revenues.  

U.K. utility revenues in 2008 declined $113 million (10%) versus 2007 primarily from the effect of the significant strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the U.K. Pound Sterling over the second half of 2008. EBIT in 2008 was relatively unchanged from 2007 as the revenue decline was offset primarily by lower operating costs and interest expense.  

Real estate brokerage revenues in 2008 declined $364 million (24%) compared to 2007 due to significant declines in transaction volume as well as lower average home sales prices. Real estate brokerage activities generated a loss before interest and taxes of $45 million in 2008 versus EBIT of $42 million in 2007. The loss in 2008 reflected the continuing weak U.S. housing markets.  

In the fourth quarter of 2008, EBIT from other activities included a gain of $917 million from MidAmericans investments in Constellation Energy as well as a fee of $175 million received as a result of the termination of the planned acquisition of Constellation Energy. EBIT from other activities in 2006 included gains of $117 million primarily from the disposal of equity securities. There were no significant securities gains in 2007.  

MECs revenues in 2007 increased $806 million (23%) over 2006. MECs non-regulated energy sales in 2007 exceeded 2006 by $597 million primarily due to improved market opportunities. MECs regulated wholesale and retail electricity sales in 2007 exceeded 2006 by $155 million, which reflected the impact of new generating assets and improved opportunities in wholesale markets as well as higher retail demand due to warmer temperatures and increases in the number of retail customers. EBIT of MEC in 2007 increased $64 million (18%), reflecting the margins on the increases in regulated and non-regulated energy sales, partially offset by higher facilities operating and maintenance costs.  

PacifiCorps revenues in 2007 increased $1,348 million (45%) and EBIT increased $336 million (94%) versus 2006. Revenues and EBIT of PacifiCorp for 2006 are included beginning as of the acquisition date (March 21, 2006). In 2007, PacifiCorps revenues and EBIT were favorably impacted by regulatory-approved rate increases and higher customer usage in retail markets, as well as increased margins on wholesale electricity sales, partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs.  

Revenues from natural gas pipelines in 2007 increased $116 million (12%) over 2006 due primarily to favorable market conditions and because revenues in 2006 reflected the impact of estimated rate case refunds to customers. EBIT in 2007 from natural gas pipelines increased $97 million (26%) over 2006 mainly due to comparatively higher revenue and lower depreciation due to expected changes in depreciation rates in connection with a current rate proceeding.  

Revenues from U.K. utilities in 2007 increased over the comparable 2006 period primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.K. Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar as well as higher gas production and electricity distribution revenues. EBIT from the U.K. utilities in 2007 was essentially unchanged compared to 2006 as higher maintenance and depreciation costs and the write-off of unsuccessful gas exploration costs offset the impact of higher revenues.  

Revenues and EBIT in 2007 from real estate brokerage declined 12% and 43%, respectively, compared to 2006, primarily due to significantly lower transaction volume as a result of the slowdown in U.S. residential real estate activity.

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing  

A summary of revenues and earnings of Berkshires manufacturing, service and retailing businesses for each of the past three years follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Management evaluates the results of NetJets using accounting standards for recognition of revenue and planned major maintenance expenses that were generally accepted when Berkshire acquired NetJets but are no longer acceptable due to subsequent changes adopted by the FASB. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for the other service businesses shown above reflect these prior revenue and expense recognition methods. Revenues shown above exceeded the amounts reported in Berkshires Consolidated Financial Statements by $130 million in 2008, $709 million in 2007 and $781 million in 2006. Pre-tax earnings in this table exceeded (was less than) the amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements by ($4 million) in 2008, $48 million in 2007 and $79 million in 2006.  

Marmon  

Berkshire acquired a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (Marmon) on March 18, 2008. During the second quarter of 2008, Berkshire acquired additional shares and currently has a 63.6% interest. Marmons operating results are included in Berkshires consolidated results and in the preceding table from the date of the initial acquisition. Marmon consists of approximately 130 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within 11 diverse business sectors. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of Marmons operations. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2008, Marmons consolidated revenues and operating income were $6,960 million and $977 million, respectively, compared to $6,934 million and $946 million, respectively in 2007.  

McLane Company  

McLane Company, Inc., (McLane) is a wholesale distributor of grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLanes business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLanes revenues of $29,852 million in 2008 increased $1,773 million (6%) compared to 2007 which increased $2,386 million (9%) compared to 2006. The revenue increases in both 2008 and 2007 reflected additional grocery and foodservice customers as well as manufacturer price increases and state excise tax increases.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2008 increased $44 million over 2007, which was relatively unchanged from 2006. The increase in 2008 reflected the increased sales and to a lesser degree a slight increase in gross margins. The gross margin rate was 5.91% in 2008 compared to 5.79% in 2007. The comparative increase in the gross margin rate reflected price changes related to certain categories of grocery products and the impact of a heavy liquids sales surcharge. Operating expenses in 2008 as a percentage of revenues were relatively unchanged compared to 2007. Approximately one-third of McLanes annual revenues are from Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart could have a material adverse impact on McLanes earnings.  

Shaw Industries  

Shaw Industries (Shaw) is the worlds largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets and is a full-service flooring company. Shaw revenues of $5,052 million in 2008 declined $321 million (6%) compared to 2007. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a reduction in year-to-date residential carpet sales volume, partially offset by higher average selling prices and

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)  

Shaw Industries (Continued)  

 revenues from recent acquisitions. The decrease in residential carpet volume in 2008 reflected the significant downturn in residential real estate activity that began in 2006 and was exacerbated by the credit crises during 2007 and 2008.  

In 2008, pre-tax earnings declined $231 million (53%) to $205 million. The decline was attributable to both lower sales volume and higher product costs. Increases in petrochemical based raw material costs along with reduced manufacturing efficiencies caused the product cost increase. The gross margin rate for 2008 was approximately 3 percentage points lower as compared to 2007. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 also included $52 million of charges in the fourth quarter related to asset writedowns and plant closure costs. To offset the impact of rising raw material and production costs, Shaw instituted multiple sales price increases in 2008 and closed certain manufacturing facilities. Management expects residential real estate activity and, as a result, Shaws sales volume to remain weak during 2009.  

Revenues of $5,373 million in 2007 declined $461 million (8%) compared to 2006. In 2007, carpet volume decreased 10% versus 2006 due to lower sales in residential markets, partially offset by a modest increase in commercial market volume. In 2007, pre-tax earnings decreased $158 million (27%) compared to 2006. The decline reflects the aforementioned lower sales volume and higher product costs. These factors combined to produce declines in gross margin dollars in 2007 of approximately 17% versus 2006. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2007 declined approximately 6% compared with 2006, reflecting lower sales volume and expense control efforts.  

Other manufacturing  

Berkshires other manufacturing businesses include a wide array of businesses. Included in this group are several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel business). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, CTB International (CTB), a manufacturer of equipment for the livestock and agricultural industries and ISCAR Metalworking Companies (IMC), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide. There are also numerous other manufacturers of consumer and commercial products in this diverse group.  

Revenues of other manufacturing businesses in 2008 of $14,127 million declined $332 million (2%) versus 2007. The most significant declines were from Forest River, the building products businesses and the apparel businesses. These were somewhat offset by increased revenues from IMC and from Richline, a jewelry manufacturer acquired during the second half of 2007. Pre-tax earnings of other manufacturing businesses of $1,675 million in 2008, declined $362 million (18%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings declined or were flat in nearly all of Berkshires other manufacturing operations with the exception of IMC. Pre-tax earnings from Forest River declined 56%, due to lower sales volume. Pre-tax earnings from apparel declined 34%, primarily due to lower sales volume and costs incurred to consolidate certain operations of Russell and Vanity Fair Brands. Pre-tax earnings from building products declined 28%, as a result of lower sales volumes and decreased manufacturing efficiencies as a consequence of the housing and credit crises.  

Revenues in 2007 from other manufacturing activities were $14,459 million, an increase of $2,471 million (21%) over 2006. The comparative increase was primarily attributable to the businesses acquired since mid-2006 as well as a significant increase from CTB. Revenues from the building products businesses declined $292 million in 2007 as demand was negatively affected by the slowdown in housing construction activity. Pre-tax earnings were $2,037 million in 2007, an increase of $281 million (16%) over 2006. The increases were primarily due to full-year inclusion in 2007 of IMC and increased earnings of CTB, partially offset by a 22% decline in earnings of the building products businesses.  

Other service  

Berkshires other service businesses include NetJets, the worlds leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft, and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor (acquired March 2007); Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; The Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; International Dairy Queen, a licensor and service provider to about 5,700 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; The Buffalo News, a publisher of a daily and Sunday newspaper; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.

Other service (Continued)  

In 2008, revenues of the group were $8,435 million, an increase of $643 million (8%) over 2007. The inclusion of twelve months of revenues from TTI in 2008 versus nine months in 2007 accounted for over 80% of the revenue increase. Excluding the impact of TTI, other service revenues in 2008 increased 2% over 2007.  

Pre-tax earnings of $971 million in 2008, were relatively unchanged from 2007. The impact from the TTI acquisition and increased earnings of FlightSafety was offset by lower earnings from NetJets and Pampered Chef. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NetJets, and to a lesser degree Pampered Chef, experienced a significant reduction in revenue as general economic conditions worsened. This resulted in lower customer usage and demand which negatively affected operating margins. In addition, NetJets incurred charges of $54 million to writedown the aircraft fleet.  

Revenues from the other service businesses in 2007 increased $1,981 million (34%) and pre-tax earnings increased $310 million (47%) as compared to 2006. The increase in revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2007 versus 2006 was attributable to the impact of business acquisitions (primarily TTI and Business Wire) as well as increased revenues and pre-tax earnings from FlightSafety and NetJets. Both of these businesses benefited in 2007 from higher equipment (simulators and aircraft) utilization rates and from increased customer demand.  

Retailing  

Berkshires retailing operations consist of four home furnishings (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans) and three jewelry (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) retailers. Sees Candies is also included in this group. Retailing revenues were $3,104 million in 2008, a decrease of $293 million (9%) versus 2007. Pre-tax earnings of $163 million in 2008 declined $111 million (41%) compared to 2007. Seven of the eight retail operations experienced revenue declines and all eight of these operations had declines in earnings compared to 2007. During the first nine months of 2008, as the impact of the economic recession in the U.S. worsened, consumer spending declined. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline accelerated and conditions for most retailers throughout the U.S. deteriorated. Fourth quarter of 2008 revenues and pre-tax earnings of Berkshires retailers declined 17% and 33%, respectively, versus the fourth quarter of 2007.  

Finance and Financial Products  

A summary of revenues and earnings from Berkshires finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues from manufactured housing and finance activities (Clayton Homes) in 2008 decreased $105 million (3%) from 2007. The decrease included a 9% decline from home sales, reflecting declines in units sold and average selling prices. In addition, revenues in 2007 included approximately $90 million from the housing communities division which was sold in the first quarter of 2008. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase in interest income from installment loans. The increase in interest income reflects higher average installment loan balances in 2008 versus 2007. Installment loan balances were approximately $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion since December 31, 2007. The increase was principally due to loan portfolio acquisitions.  

Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes in 2008 declined $320 million (61%) from 2007. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 included a $125 million increase in the provision for estimated loan losses due to changes in loan collection and recovery assumptions,

Finance and Financial Products (Continued)  

 $25 million of losses arising from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and $38 million from asset writedowns and plant closure costs. Pre-tax earnings in 2008 also reflected the impact of lower home sales and higher interest expense from increased borrowings and an increase in interest rates. Partially offsetting these declines was a $22 million gain from the sale of the housing community division in the first quarter of 2008.  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings from furniture and transportation equipment leasing activities in 2008 declined $37 million (5%) and $24 million (22%), respectively, compared to 2007. The declines primarily reflected lower rental income driven by relatively low utilization rates for over-the-road trailer and storage units, partially offset by the impact of a small furniture rental business acquisition in 2008. Significant cost components of this business are fixed (depreciation and facility expenses), so earnings declined disproportionately to revenues. Revenues and pre-tax earnings for 2007 decreased $70 million (8%) and $71 million (39%), respectively, as compared to 2006, primarily for the reasons previously stated.  

Earnings from other finance business activities consisted primarily of interest income earned on fixed maturity investments and from a small portfolio of commercial real estate loans. Pre-tax earnings in 2007 reflected a charge of approximately $67 million from the adverse effects of changes in mortality assumptions on certain life annuity contract liabilities. In 2006, pre-tax earnings included income of $67 million from an equity purchase commitment fee.  

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses  

A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments, recognition of non-cash other-than-temporary-impairment losses or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, impact on total shareholders equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other-than-temporary-impairment losses recorded in 2008 were primarily attributable to investments in certain equity securities. Berkshire considers several factors in determining impairment losses including the current and expected long-term business prospects of the issuer, the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline and its ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers.  

Derivative gains/losses in 2008 primarily represented the non-cash changes in fair value of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of equity and credit markets. Management does not view the periodic gains or losses from the changes in fair value as meaningful given the long-term nature of these contracts and the volatile nature of equity and credit markets over short periods of time. Therefore, the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses may not be known for years.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

Losses from credit default contracts in 2008 derived primarily from valuation increases due to significant widening of credit default spreads during the fourth quarter of 2008 with respect to the non-investment grade issuers included in the high yield index contracts and the credit default spreads of certain states and municipalities. The estimated fair value of credit default contracts at December 31, 2008 was $4.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2007. The year-to-date increase included fair value pre-tax losses of $1.8 billion and premiums from contracts entered into in 2008 of $633 million, partially offset by loss payments of $152 million. In January 2009, there were defaults by six companies included in the high yield indexes. Estimated payments in the first quarter of 2009 related to these defaults are expected to be approximately $750 million.  

The estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts at December 31, 2008 was $10.0 billion, an increase of approximately $5.4 billion from December 31, 2007 and an increase of $3.3 billion from September 30, 2008. The year-to-date increase included pre-tax losses of $5.0 billion due to changes in fair values and premiums from new contracts. There have been no loss payments under equity index put option contracts. Berkshires losses from equity index put option contracts in 2008 reflected index value declines of between 30% and 45% in 2008 across the four indexes. During the fourth quarter of 2008 these indexes declined between 10% and 22%. These contracts expire beginning in 2019 with the last expiration in 2028. Any loss payments under these contracts will be based on the net decline in the underlying index below the strike price in each contract as of the expiration date of the contract.  

Financial Condition  

Berkshires balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity. Consolidated cash and invested assets, excluding assets of utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses, was approximately $122.0 billion at December 31, 2008 (including cash and cash equivalents of $24.3 billion) and $141.2 billion at December 31, 2007 (including cash and cash equivalents of $37.7 billion). Berkshires invested assets are held predominantly in its insurance businesses. The decline in cash and invested assets is primarily due to a significant reduction in the carrying amount of equity securities resulting from the worldwide economic crisis.  

Berkshire acquired a 60% interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (Marmon) for $4.5 billion on March 18, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, Berkshire acquired additional shares and currently owns 63.6% of Marmon. Berkshire has agreed to acquire the remaining minority shareholders interests in Marmon between 2011 and 2014 for consideration based on Marmons future earnings.  

During the fourth quarter of 2008, Berkshire invested $6.5 billion in subordinated notes and preferred stock of the Wm. Wrigley, Jr. Company in connection with Mars, Incorporateds acquisition of that entity. In addition, Berkshire invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs perpetual preferred stock and common stock warrants and $3 billion in General Electric Company perpetual preferred stock and common stock warrants. These investments were funded with available cash.  

Notes payable and other borrowings of the insurance and other businesses were $4.3 billion (includes about $2.3 billion issued or guaranteed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) at December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2007, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings (principally NetJets) and debt of businesses acquired in 2008, (principally Marmon).  

MidAmericans capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in 2008 and are forecasted to be approximately $3.3 billion in 2009. MidAmerican expects to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and debt proceeds. Certain of its borrowings are secured by certain assets of its regulated utility subsidiaries. Notes payable and other borrowings of MidAmerican maturing in 2009 are $1.26 billion with an additional $1.26 billion due before the end of 2011. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2011 to provide up to $3.5 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund MidAmericans regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire has not and does not intend to guarantee the repayment of debt by MidAmerican or any of its subsidiaries.  

Assets of the finance and financial products businesses as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities were $30.7 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $22.0 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase from 2007 primarily relates to an increase of $7.7 billion in derivative contract liabilities (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the preceding section of Managements   

42

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Financial Condition (Continued)  

 Discussion for additional information). As of December 31, 2008, notes payable and other borrowings of $13.4 billion included $10.8 billion of medium-term notes issued by BHFC. During 2008, BHFC issued debt of $5.0 billion and repaid $3.1 billion of notes. BHFC notes are guaranteed by Berkshire and mature at various dates extending through 2018. The proceeds from these notes were used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes.  

During 2008, credit markets became increasingly restricted as a consequence of the ongoing worldwide credit crisis. As a result, the availability of credit to corporations has declined significantly and interest rates for new issues increased relative to government obligations, even for companies with strong credit histories and ratings. Although management believes that the credit crisis is temporary and that Berkshire has ample liquidity and capital to withstand these conditions, restricted access to credit markets over longer periods could have a significant negative impact on operations, particularly the utilities and energy business and certain finance and financial products operations. Management believes that it currently maintains ample liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and provide for contingent liquidity needs.  

During 2008, Berkshires consolidated shareholders equity declined from $120.7 billion at the end of 2007 to $109.3 billion at December 31, 2008. This reduction was largely due to significant price declines in Berkshires equity investments and an increase in the fair value of the liabilities arising from Berkshires equity index put option contracts. The worldwide economic crisis has continued during the first part of 2009 and prices of Berkshires equity investments have declined further and the fair values of liabilities arising from equity index put option contracts have increased further. Berkshire estimates that its consolidated shareholders equity has been reduced by approximately $8 billion since the end of 2008.  

Contractual Obligations  

Berkshire and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Contractual obligations arise under financing and other agreements, which are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other long-term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations, including future minimum rentals under operating leases, will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.  

Contractual obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are estimates. The timing and amount of such payments are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities that will occur over many years. The amounts presented in the following table have been estimated based upon past claim settlement activities and therefore are subject to significant estimation error. The factors affecting the ultimate amount of claims are discussed in the following section regarding Berkshires critical accounting policies. In addition, certain losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty loss reserves are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and therefore are recoverable. Such recoverables are not reflected in the table.  

A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 follows. Amounts are in millions.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available.  

Property and casualty losses  

A summary of Berkshires consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers compensation reserves, liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects.  

Berkshire records liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used.  

As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails.  

Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition to the factors cited above, reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders.  

Berkshires insurance businesses utilize loss reserving techniques that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding reserving processes of the significant businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.  

GEICO  

GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves as of December 31, 2008 were $7,336 million. As of December 31, 2008, gross reserves included $5,265 million of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2,071 million of IBNR reserves.

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

GEICO (Continued)  

GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance which has a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting GEICOs reserves include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity), which includes loss adjustment expenses.  

GEICOs reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate.  

Actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves) are: (1) average reserves (20%), (2) case and case development reserves (55%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Such amounts are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other factors. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows.  

Average reserve amounts are established for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are established as a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for which claims adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.  

Claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known.  

For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, additional case development reserve estimates are established, usually as a percentage of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2008, case development reserves averaged approximately 20% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically.  

For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management.  

For each of its major coverages, GEICO tests the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.  

Loss reserve estimates recorded at the end of 2007 developed downward by approximately $205 million when reevaluated at December 31, 2008 producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2008. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 2% of earned premiums in 2008 and approximately 3% of the prior year-end reserve amount. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2008 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether frequency and severity turn out to be more or less than anticipated.  

Within the automobile line of business the reserves with the most uncertainty are for liability coverages, due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 90% of GEICOs reserves as of December 31, 2008 were for automobile liability, of which bodily

 injury (BI) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. Management believes it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, the reserves would develop up or down by approximately $112 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.  

GEICOs exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining reserves associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICOs total reserves (approximately 2%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant.  

General Re and BHRG  

General Res and BHRGs property and casualty loss reserves derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. There are additional uncertainties unique to loss reserving processes for reinsurance. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of contract terms and conditions, the wide variability of coverage needs of individual clients and the tendency for those needs to change rapidly in response to market conditions, the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties, in and of themselves, cannot be reliably measured.  

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess contracts or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when company personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. Loss information from aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally loss information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.  

Each of Berkshires reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client periodic reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. These practices are periodically evaluated and changed as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified.  

The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is delayed in comparison with primary insurance. In some instances there are multiple reinsurers assuming and ceding parts of an underlying risk causing multiple contractual intermediaries between General Re or BHRG and the primary insured. In these instances, the delays in reporting can be compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims to the reinsurer until they believe it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance.  

Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. In continental Europe, reinsurance reporting practices vary. Fewer clients report premiums, losses and case reserves on a quarterly basis. In certain countries, clients report annually, generally 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The extended reporting lag does not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays.

General Re and BHRG (Continued)  

Premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Reinsurance contracts generally allow for Berkshires reinsurance subsidiaries to have access to the cedants books and records with respect to the subject business and provide them the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted when management deems it appropriate.  

In the normal course of business, disputes with clients arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under the reinsurance policies. Most coverage disputes are resolved by the companys claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or by independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on Berkshires results of operations or financial condition.  

In summary, the scope, number and potential variability of assumptions required in estimating ultimate losses from reinsurance contracts of General Re and BHRG are more uncertain than primary property and casualty insurers due to the factors previously discussed.  

General Re  

General Res gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2008 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)  Net of discounts of $2,616 million.  

  (2)  Includes directors and officers and errors and omissions coverage.  

  (3)  Includes medical malpractice and umbrella coverage.  

General Res process of establishing loss reserve estimates is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. Critical judgments in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the expectation of ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the case reserve reporting trends compared to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence pattern time period.  

General Re does not routinely determine loss reserve ranges because it believes that the techniques necessary have not sufficiently developed and the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, counts of claims or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail.  

Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2008, ACRs aggregated $3.1 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2008, claim examiners conducted about 340 claim reviews.

General Re (Continued)  

Actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. These loss aggregations are internally called loss triangles which serve as the primary basis for IBNR reserve calculations. Over 300 reserve cells are reviewed for North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells are reviewed with respect to international business.  

Loss triangles are used to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, are further used to determine IBNR reserves. Additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern. The determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, estimation formulas are used along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. These factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.  

Expected loss ratios are selected by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios will not be accurate and this can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios.  

IBNR reserves are estimated by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. This calculation does not involve new assumptions and uses the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.  

In 2008, for prior years workers compensation losses, reported claims were less than expected claims by about $93 million. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for additional IBNR. These developments precipitated about $116 million of a net increase in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After deducting $117 million for the change in net reserve discounts during the year, workers compensation losses from prior years reduced pre-tax earnings in 2008 by $140 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for General Res significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves of approximately $623 million and $339 million on a discounted basis as of December 31, 2008. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were favorable in 2008 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For General Res significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $805 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $805 million.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re (Continued)  

Property losses were lower than expected in 2008 but the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses. In response to favorable claim developments and another year of information, estimated remaining World Trade Center losses were reduced by $25 million.  

In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For General Res large D&O and E&O reserve cells an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $250 million. Management believes it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Unpaid mass tort reserves at December 31, 2008 were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance. Such reserves were approximately $1.8 billion gross and $1.2 billion net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2007. Mass tort net claims paid were about $69 million in 2008. In 2008, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $45 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, General Re considers survival ratios based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The three year survival ratio was approximately fourteen years as of December 31, 2008. The insurance industrys comparable survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately nine years. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.  

BHRG  

BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2008 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In general, the methodologies used to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change.  

As of December 31, 2008, BHRGs gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominantly casualty losses. Retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. Retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses paid in 2008 were $1.2 billion. The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of case reserves. Reserves are reviewed and established in the aggregate by contract including provisions for IBNR reserves.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, historical aggregate loss payment patterns are often analyzed and projected into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. Management assigns judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. Management monitors claim payment activity and reviews ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, management reassesses expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. During 2008, retroactive reserves developed upward by approximately $200 million.  

BHRGs liabilities for environmental, asbestos, and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses are presently concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. Reserves for such losses were approximately $9.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Losses paid in 2008 attributable to these exposures were approximately $700 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not regularly receive reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured is conducted to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future.  

The maximum losses payable by BHRG under retroactive policies are not expected to exceed approximately $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2008. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, management currently believes it unlikely that unpaid losses as of December 31, 2008 ($16.6 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%.  

A significant number of recent reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes, terrorism and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008, and were essentially unchanged from the prior year. In 2008 and 2007, loss reserves for prior years events declined by approximately $200 million which produced corresponding increases to pre-tax earnings each year. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.  

Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by managements judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared.  

Derivative contract liabilities  

Berkshires Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. These contracts were primarily entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to the Company that periodically shows trading volume and actual prices. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Derivative contract liabilities (Continued)  

 Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values.  

In determining the fair value of most of the credit default contracts, Berkshire used bid/ask pricing data on similar contracts as the basis for estimating fair value. Pricing data is monitored and reviewed by management for consistency as well as reasonableness. Pricing data for newer credit default contracts tends to vary little among the different pricing sources, which management believes is an indication that trading of such contracts is relatively active. As contracts age towards their expiration dates, the variations in pricing data can widen, which management believes is indicative of inactive markets. However, the impact of such variations is partially mitigated by shorter remaining durations and by the availability of data on newer contracts, which is used for comparison.  

Berkshire determines the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts based on the widely used Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to that model include the current index value, strike price, discount or interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted averaged discount and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2008 were each approximately 4%. Berkshire believes the most significant economic risks relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component. For additional information, see Berkshires Market Risk Disclosures.  

The Black-Scholes model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 22%. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2008 ($10.0 billion) from changes in volatility is summarized below. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other Critical Accounting Policies  

Berkshire records deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the difference between the consideration received and the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of loss payments. Adjustments to these assumptions are applied retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.  

Berkshires Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $33.8 billion. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests. Such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of Berkshires reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss.

Market Risk Disclosures  

Berkshires Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Berkshires significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. During the fourth quarter of 2008, conditions in the public debt and equity markets declined significantly resulting in exceptional volatility in debt and equity prices. The impact of actions taken recently by governmental bodies in response to the current economic crisis is difficult to predict, particularly over the short term. Berkshire management believes that these extraordinary conditions are temporary and that equity prices will ultimately rise over time and that credit markets will normalize but cannot predict the timing or magnitude of a recovery. The fair values of Berkshires investment portfolios and its equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility, particularly over the short term. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with Berkshires business activities.  

Interest Rate Risk  

Berkshires regularly invests in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Berkshires strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. Berkshire strives to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized. Berkshire utilizes derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks on a limited basis.  

The fair values of Berkshires fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate investments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate investments.  

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that no other significant factors change that determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

Equity Price Risk  

Historically, Berkshire has maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, Berkshire strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments may be concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2008, 57% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in four investees.  

Berkshire prefers to hold equity investments for very long periods of time so management is not troubled by short-term equity price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. Berkshire strives to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility.  

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.  

Berkshire is also subject to equity price risk with respect to its equity index put option contracts. While Berkshires ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between contract inception date and expiration, the change in fair value resulting from current changes in the index values are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts generally expire 15 to 20 years from inception and may not be settled before their respective expiration dates.  

The following table summarizes Berkshires equity investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates is also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in Berkshires equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Foreign Currency Risk  

Berkshire generally does not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the consolidated financial statements. Financial statements of subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in earnings primarily as a result of the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, Berkshire holds investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as the Coca-Cola Company.

Foreign Currency Risk (Continued)  

Berkshires net assets subject to translation are primarily in the insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in the manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of certain U.S. subsidiaries as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.  

Commodity Price Risk  

Berkshire, through its ownership of MidAmerican, is subject to commodity price risk. Exposures include variations in the price of wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, fuel costs to generate electricity and natural gas supply for regulated retail gas customers. Electricity and natural gas prices are subject to wide price swings as demand responds to, among many other items, changing weather, limited storage, transmission and transportation constraints, and lack of alternative supplies from other areas. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other over-the-counter agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Accordingly, gains and losses associated with interim price movements on such contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Financial results may be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. MidAmerican does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities.  

The table that follows summarizes Berkshires commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.

Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document, as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act). Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, that include words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about Berkshire, economic and market factors and the industries in which Berkshire does business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and Berkshire has no specific intention to update these statements.  

Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause Berkshires actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of Berkshires investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or an act of terrorism that causes losses insured by Berkshires insurance subsidiaries, changes in insurance laws or regulations, changes in Federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which Berkshire and its affiliates do business.
