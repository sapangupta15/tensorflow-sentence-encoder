Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are a strategic holding company providing advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to clients through multiple agencies around the world. On a global, pan-regional and local basis, our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines: advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. The fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements. We continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client-centric approach, as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base.

On May 8, 2014, the Company and Publicis entered into a termination agreement, or Termination Agreement, under which the Company and Publicis mutually agreed to terminate their proposed merger in view of difficulties in completing the transaction within a reasonable timeframe. Under the Termination Agreement, the Company and Publicis mutually consented to terminate their Business Combination Agreement, dated July 27, 2013, or Business Combination Agreement, governing the proposed combination of the parties’ respective businesses, and mutually agreed to release each other from all claims, obligations and liabilities arising out of, in connection with or relating to the Business Combination Agreement. The Termination Agreement provided that no termination fee was payable by either party.

As a leading global advertising, marketing and corporate communications company, we operate in all major markets around the world and have a large and diverse client base. In 2014, our largest client accounted for 2.6% of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than 2.5% of our revenue. Our top 100 clients accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue in 2014. Our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 13% of our revenue in 2014. Although our revenue is generally balanced between the United States and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, as described in more detail below, our revenue increased 5.0% compared to 2013. Revenue increased in the United States 7.7%. In Europe, revenue increased modestly for the year, which reflects the strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar and a flat U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro on a year-over-year basis, despite the weakening of the British Pound and a significant weakening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, the Russian Rouble decreased significantly against the U.S. Dollar. Revenue increased moderately in most of our other markets, but the rate of growth was significantly impacted by the weakening of most currencies, in the fourth quarter, against the U.S. Dollar.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, substantially all foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. Dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue in the fourth quarter by 3.1%, or $129.4 million. Our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to U.S. Dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. For the most part, revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency, which minimizes the economic impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results of operations. Assuming exchange rates at January 30, 2015 remain unchanged, we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce 2015 revenue by approximately 5%.

Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. In particular, a contraction in global economic conditions poses a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications services which could reduce the demand for our services. In 2014, the United States experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of Asia and Latin America continued to expand. Economic conditions in the Euro Zone in 2014 were unsettled and the fiscal issues facing many countries in the European Union continue to cause economic uncertainty in many of our Euro Zone markets. We will continue to monitor economic conditions closely, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. There can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective.

Certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry. These trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan-regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non-traditional marketing channels, as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms. Additionally, in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing expenditures, clients continue to require greater coordination of marketing activities. We believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us.

In the near term, barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, as a result of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities, we expect our 2015 revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal GDP growth in our major markets. We expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms, expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today.

Given our size and breadth, we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators. The key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses. We analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth, including growth by principal regional market, growth by marketing discipline, impact from foreign currency fluctuations, growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients. In recent years, our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations.

In 2014, our revenue increased 5.0% compared to 2013. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 0.8%, acquisitions, net of dispositions increased revenue 0.1% and organic growth increased revenue 5.7%. Across our principal regional markets, revenue increased 6.5% in North America, 7.2% in the Middle East and Africa, 4.1% in Europe and 0.9% in Asia and Latin America. The increase in revenue in Europe was the result of growth in the U.K., Spain and Germany, partially

offset by reductions in several countries in the Euro Zone, and the strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Revenue in Asia Pacific increased 1.4% compared to 2013, but the rate of growth was negatively impacted by the weakening of most currencies in that region against the U.S. Dollar. The weakening of the currencies in Latin America against the U.S. Dollar offset revenue growth in that region and revenue decreased 1.1%. The increase in revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 in our four fundamental disciplines was: advertising 8.1%, CRM 1.7%, public relations 5.0% and specialty communications 1.1%.

We measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories: salary and service costs and office and general expenses. Salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs. Office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs, technology costs, depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses. Each of our agencies requires professionals with the skill sets that are common across our disciplines. At the core of the skill sets is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience. The facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines, and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software.

As a service business, we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue. Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue, increased $625.6 million, or 5.8%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Office and general expenses, which are are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, decreased $11.1 million, or 0.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013.

In 2014 and 2013, we incurred $8.8 million and $41.4 million, respectively, of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis, which were primarily comprised of professional fees. On May 8, 2014, the proposed merger was terminated. Excluding the merger expenses from both years, office and general expenses for 2014 increased $21.5 million compared to 2013, but decreased as a percentage of revenue reflecting our continuing efforts to control the cost structures of our agencies.

In 2014, operating margins increased to 12.7% from 12.5% in 2013. Excluding the merger expenses from both years, operating income and operating margin for 2014 and 2013 were $1,952.9 million and 12.7% and $1,866.7 million and 12.8%, respectively.

Net interest expense decreased $30.3 million to $134.1 million in 2014 from $164.4 million in 2013. In October 2014, we issued $750 million of 3.65% Senior Notes due 2024, or 2024 Notes. On September 29, 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap on the 4.45 % Senior Notes due 2020, or 2020 Notes. In 2014, the benefit from the interest rate swap on the 2020 Notes substantially offset the interest expense on the 2024 Notes. Interest expense for 2014 decreased $20.0 million to $177.2 million, primarily resulting from the benefit from the interest rate swap on the 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022, or 2022 Notes, entered into on May 1, 2014. The interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 Notes and the 2020 Notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. Interest income increased $10.3 million to $43.1 million in 2014 resulting from our cash management efforts and interest earned on cash balances in our international treasury centers.

In 2014, our effective tax rate decreased to 32.8% from 34.0% in 2013. Income taxes for 2014 and 2013 reflect the recognition of an income tax benefit of $11.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, related to expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis. Prior to the termination of the proposed merger on May 8, 2014, the majority of the merger costs were capitalized for income tax purposes and the related tax benefits were not recorded. Because the proposed merger was terminated, the merger costs were no longer required to be capitalized for income tax purposes. Excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses from both years, our effective tax rate for 2014 and 2013 was 33.2% and 33.6%, respectively.

Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2014 increased $112.9 million, or 11.4%, to $1,104.0 million from $991.1 million in 2013. The year-over-year increase is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per common share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased 14.3% to $4.24 in 2014, compared to $3.71 in 2013 due to the factors described above, as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding. The reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding was the result of repurchases of our common stock, net of shares issued for the conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2032, or 2032 Notes, stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. In the second quarter of 2014, following the termination of the proposed merger with Publicis, we resumed repurchases of our common stock. Excluding the net effect of the merger expenses, net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2014 and 2013 was $1,101.4 million and $1,026.0 million, respectively, and diluted net income per common share - Omnicom Group Inc. was $4.23 and $3.84, respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this MD&A. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes, including Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below.

Estimates

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our cost-method investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Acquisitions and Goodwill

We have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions. In making acquisitions, the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, competitive position, geographic coverage and services offered of the target businesses, as well as our experience and judgment.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. In circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100% of an entity is acquired, we record 100% of the goodwill acquired. Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations (earn-outs). Contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date. In 2014, we completed 10 acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest. 

Our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and/or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know-how of the acquisition targets. Accordingly, as is typical for most service businesses, a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the know-how of the workforce, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately. For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In valuing these identified intangible assets, we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements.

We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our five agency networks. The regional reporting units of each agency network monitor the performance and are responsible for the agencies in their region. They report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client-centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or FASB ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, and the guidance set forth in FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. The main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs, which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software and other overhead expenses. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy.

Goodwill Impairment Review - Estimates and Assumptions

We use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach, which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows, (2) comparative market participant multiples for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions.

In applying the income approach, we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows (“DCF”) for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin, EBITDA, tax rates, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long-term cash flow growth rates. All of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses, economic conditions related to the industry we operate in, as well as conditions in the global economy. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a DCF methodology are: (1) the expected long-term growth rate of our reporting units' cash flows and (2) the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”).

The range of assumptions for the long-term growth rate and WACC used in our evaluations as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Long-term growth rate represents our estimate of the long-term growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in. The average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was 5.6% and the Average Nominal GDP growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was 4.2% over the same period. We considered this history when determining the long-term growth rates used in our annual impairment test at June 30, 2014. We believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to GDP. We also believe, based on our historical performance, that our long-term growth rate will exceed Average Nominal GDP growth in the markets we operate in. For the annual test as of June 30, 2014, we used an estimated long-term growth rate of 4% for our reporting units.

When performing the annual impairment test as of June 30, 2014 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units, we considered the current macroeconomic environment, as well as industry and market specific conditions at mid-year 2014. In the first half of 2014, we experienced an increase in our revenue of 5.1%, which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Economic conditions in the Euro Zone in 2014 were unsettled and the fiscal issues facing many countries in the European Union continue to cause economic uncertainty in many of our Euro Zone markets. We considered the effect of these conditions in the annual impairment test. 

The WACC is comprised of: (1) a risk-free rate of return, (2) a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market, (3) an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and (4) a current after-tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units, each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt. 

Our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them. These differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units. In addition, these differences as well as differences in book value, including goodwill, cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units. The reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of Omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded. The remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result, they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt.

12

Goodwill Impairment Review - Conclusion

Under U.S. GAAP, we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Although not required, we performed Step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Based on the results of the impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2014, because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective net book value. The minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 70%. Notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our WACC and long-term growth rate are reasonable, we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units. The results of this sensitivity analysis on the impairment test as of June 30, 2014 revealed that if the WACC increased by 1% and/or the long-term growth rate decreased by 1%, the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and would pass Step 1 of the impairment test.

We will continue to perform the impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test. The estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations, but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, but they are subject to change from period to period. Actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material. A change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non-cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Subsequent to the annual impairment test at June 30, 2014, there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test. Additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and applicable SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services based on a rate per hour or equivalent basis. Revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process. Prior to recognizing revenue, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist, the sales price must be fixed or determinable, delivery, performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection must be reasonably assured. These principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines: advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements. Because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways, all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines.

In the majority of our businesses, we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned. Although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities, the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf. In these cases, costs incurred with third-party suppliers are excluded from our revenue. In certain arrangements, we act as principal and we contract directly with third-party suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment. In these circumstances, revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services.

Some of our client arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to quantitative and qualitative goals. We recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved, or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client.

13

In May 2014, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09, which replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early application is not permitted. ASU 2014-09 provides for one of two methods of transition: retrospective application to each prior period presented; or, recognition of the cumulative effect of retrospective application of the new standard in the period of initial application. We will apply ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2017. However, we are not yet in a position to assess the transition method we will choose, or the impact of the application on our results of operations or financial position.

Additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life, rate of risk free interest, volatility and dividend yield. If different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value, our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined and fixed on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock. Additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Share-based compensation expense of $93.5 million, $86.3 million and $80.8 million, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was primarily attributed to restricted stock awards. Information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Additional information regarding new accounting guidance can be found in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2014 Compared to 2013 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2014 and 2013, we incurred $8.8 million and $41.4 million of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis, which were primarily comprised of professional fees. On May 8, 2014, the proposed merger was terminated. Excluding the merger expenses, operating income and operating margin for 2014 and 2013 were $1,952.9 million and 12.7% and $1,866.7 million and 12.8%, respectively, and EBITA and EBITA margin for 2014 and 2013 were $2,060.0 million and 13.4% and $1,967.5 million and 13.5%, respectively. Excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses of $11.4 million in 2014 and $6.5 million in 2013, income tax expense was $604.5 million in 2014 and $571.7 million in 2013. Excluding the after-tax effect of the merger expenses, net income - Omnicom Group Inc. was $1,101.4 million in 2014 and $1,026.0 million in 2013.

EBITA, which we define as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets, and EBITA Margin, which we define as EBITA divided by Revenue, are Non-GAAP financial measures. We use EBITA and EBITA Margin as additional operating performance measures, which exclude the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. The table above reconciles EBITA and EBITA Margin to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of Operating Income for the periods presented. We believe that EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures to evaluate the performance of our businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

Revenue

In 2014, revenue increased $733.3 million, or 5.0%, to $15,317.8 million from $14,584.5 million in 2013. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue $112.6 million, acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $19.0 million and organic growth increased revenue $826.9 million. 

15

The components of 2014 revenue change in the United States (“Domestic”) and the remainder of the world (“International”) were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The components and percentages are calculated as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The acquisition component is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses, less revenue of any business included in the prior period revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.

•Organic growth is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition components from total revenue growth.

•The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component ($14,584.5 million for the Total column).

For the year ended December 31, 2014, changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 0.8%, or $112.6 million, compared to 2013. The most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of several currencies, including the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Russian Rouble and South African Rand, against the U.S. Dollar. This was partially offset by the strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, substantially all foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. Dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 by 3.1%, or $129.4 million. Our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to U.S. Dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. However, for the most part, revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency, which minimizes the economic impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results of operations. Assuming exchange rates at January 30, 2015 remain unchanged, we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce 2015 revenue by approximately 5%.

Revenue for 2014 and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2013 in our principal regional markets were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Europe comprises the United Kingdom and various Euro currency countries and other European countries that have not adopted the European Union Monetary standard. In 2014, the percentage of revenue attributed to the U.K. was 9.8% and the percentage of revenue attributed the Euro currency and other European countries was 18.5%. In 2014, total revenue growth for the U.K. was 12.5% and total revenue growth for the Euro currency and other European countries was 0.1%.

In the normal course of business, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors. The net change in 2014 was an overall gain in new business. Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients. Our largest client represented 2.6% and 2.7% of revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other client represented more than 2.5% of revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 18.1% and 50.4% of revenue in 2014, respectively and 19.1% and 51.3% of revenue in 2013, respectively.

Driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities, we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services through various client-centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives. These services include advertising, brand consultancy, content marketing, corporate social responsibility consulting, crisis communications, custom publishing, data analytics, database management, direct marketing, entertainment marketing, environmental design, experiential marketing, field marketing, financial/corporate business-to-business advertising, graphic arts/digital imaging, healthcare communications, instore design, interactive marketing, investor relations, marketing research, media planning and buying, mobile marketing, multi-cultural marketing, non-profit marketing, organizational communications, package design, product placement, promotional marketing, public affairs, public relations, reputation consulting, retail marketing, search engine marketing, social media marketing and sports and event marketing. In an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories: advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications.

Revenue for 2014 and 2013 and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2013 by discipline were (in millions):

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for 2014 compared to 2013 were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue. Salary and service costs increased $625.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting growth in revenue and increases related to changes in the mix of our business during the period, including increased use of freelance labor.

Office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs. Office and general expenses decreased $11.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013.

In 2014 and 2013, we incurred $8.8 million and $41.4 million, respectively, of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis, which were primarily comprised of professional fees. On May 8, 2014, the proposed merger was terminated. Excluding the merger expenses, office and general expenses for 2014 increased $21.5 million compared to 2013, but decreased as a percentage of revenue reflecting our continuing efforts to control the cost structures of our agencies.

Operating margins in 2014 increased to 12.7% from 12.5% in 2013 and EBITA margins in 2014 increased to 13.4% from 13.2% in 2013. Excluding the merger expenses from both years, operating income and operating margin for 2014 and 2013 were $1,952.9 million and 12.7% and $1,866.7 million and 12.8%, respectively, and EBITA and EBITA margin for 2014 and 2013 were $2,060.0 million and 13.4% and $1,967.5 million and 13.5%, respectively.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense decreased $30.3 million to $134.1 million in 2014 from $164.4 million in 2013. In October 2014, we issued $750 million principal amount of our 2024 Notes. On September 29, 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap on the 2020 Notes. In 2014, the benefit from the interest rate swap on the 2020 Notes substantially offset the interest expense on the 2024 Notes. Interest expense for 2014 decreased $20.0 million to $177.2 million, primarily resulting from the benefit from the interest rate swap on the 2022 Notes, entered into on May 1, 2014. The interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 Notes and the 2020 Notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. Interest income increased $10.3 million to $43.1 million in 2014 resulting from our cash management efforts and interest earned on cash balances in our international treasury centers.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate decreased to 32.8% in 2014 from 34.0% in 2013. Income taxes for 2014 and 2013 reflect the recognition of an income tax benefit of $11.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, related to expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis. Prior to the termination of the proposed merger on May 8, 2014, the majority of the merger costs were capitalized for income tax purposes and the related tax benefits were not recorded. Because the proposed merger was terminated, the merger costs were no longer required to be capitalized for income tax purposes. Excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses from both years, our effective tax rate for 2014 and 2013 was 33.2% and 33.6%, respectively.

Net Income Per Common Share - Omnicom Group Inc.

Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. increased $112.9 million, or 11.4%, to $1,104.0 million in 2014 from $991.1 million in 2013. The year-over-year increase in net income - Omnicom Group Inc. is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per common share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased 14.3% to $4.24 in 2014, compared to $3.71 in 2013 due to the factors described above, as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding. The reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding was the result of repurchases of our common stock, net of shares issued for the conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2032, or 2032 notes, stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. In the second quarter of 2014, following the termination of the proposed merger with Publicis, we resumed repurchases of our common stock. Excluding the after-tax effect of the merger expenses from both years, net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2014 and 2013 was $1,101.4 million and $1,026.0 million, respectively, and diluted net income per common share - Omnicom Group Inc. was $4.23 and $3.84, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2013 Compared to 2012 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2013, we incurred $41.4 million of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis, which were primarily comprised of professional fees. On May 8, 2014, the proposed merger was terminated. Excluding the merger expenses, operating income and operating margin for 2013 were $1,866.7 million and 12.8%, respectively, and EBITA and EBITA margin for 2013 were $1,967.5 million and 13.5%, respectively. Excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses of $6.5 million, income tax expense in 2013 was $571.7 million. Excluding the after-tax effect of the merger expenses, net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2013 was $1,026.0 million.

EBITA, which we define as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets, and EBITA Margin, which we define as EBITA divided by Revenue, are Non-GAAP financial measures. We use EBITA and EBITA Margin as additional operating performance measures, which exclude the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. The table above reconciles EBITA and EBITA Margin to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of Operating Income for the periods presented. We believe that EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures to evaluate the performance of our businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

Revenue

In 2013, revenue increased $365.1 million, 2.6%, to $14,584.5 million from $14,219.4 million in 2012. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $84.3 million, acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $51.7 million and organic growth increased revenue by $501.1 million.

The components of 2013 revenue change in the United States (“Domestic”) and the remainder of the world (“International”) were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The components and percentages are calculated as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The acquisition component is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses, less revenue of any business included in the prior period revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.

•Organic growth is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition components from total revenue growth.

•The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component ($14,219.4 million for the Total column).

In 2013, changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 0.6%, or $84.3 million, compared to 2012. The most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of several currencies, including the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and South African Rand, against the U.S. Dollar. This was partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar.

Revenue for 2013 and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2012 in our principal regional markets were (in millions):

In the normal course of business, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors. The net change in 2013 was an overall gain in new business. Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients. Or largest client represented 2.7% and 2.6% of our revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively. No other client represented more than 2.5% and 2.6% of our revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 19.1% and 51.3% of revenue in 2013, respectively, and 19.0% and 51.7% of revenue in 2012, respectively.

Revenue for 2013 and 2012 and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2012 by discipline were (in millions):

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for 2013 compared to 2012 were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

21

Salary and services costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue. Salary and service costs increased $317.6 million in 2013 compared to 2012 reflecting growth in revenue and an increase in employee compensation, including incentive compensation and severance, as well as increases related to changes in the mix of our business during the year.

Office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs. Office and general expenses increased $26.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012.

In 2013, we incurred $41.4 million of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with Publicis, which were primarily comprised of professional fees. On May 8, 2014, the proposed merger was terminated. Excluding the merger expenses, office and general expenses for 2013 decreased $15.0 million compared to 2012 reflecting our continuing efforts to control the cost structures of our agencies.

Operating margins in 2013 decreased to 12.5% from 12.7% in 2012 and EBITA margins in 2013 decreased to 13.2% from 13.4% in 2012. Excluding the merger expenses, operating income and operating margins for 2013 and 2012 were $1,866.7 million and 12.8% and $1,804.2 million and 12.7%, respectively, and EBITA and EBITA margins for 2013 and 2012 were $1,967.5 million and 13.5% and $1,905.3 million and 13.4%, respectively.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased to $164.4 million in 2013 from $144.6 million in 2012. Interest expense increased $17.5 million to $197.2 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the issuance of $750 million of our 2022 Notes in April 2012 and $500 million of our 2022 Notes in August 2012. Interest income decreased $2.3 million to $32.8 million in 2013.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate increased to 34.0% in 2013 from 31.8% in 2012. Excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses of $6.5 million, which reflects the estimated impact of the non-deductibility of a significant portion of the merger expenses, our effective tax rate for 2013 was 33.6%, which is consistent with our expected effective tax rate for 2013 and reflects the full year effect of the reduction in income tax expense resulting from the implementation of the legal reorganization in the Asia Pacific region, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Income (Loss) From Equity Method Investments

Income from equity method investments in 2013 was $15.9 million compared to a loss of $15.0 million in the prior year. 2012 reflects a net impairment charge of $29.2 million for an other-than-temporary decline in the carrying value of our equity investment in Egypt.

Net Income Per Common Share - Omnicom Group Inc.

Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. decreased $7.2 million, or 0.7%, to $991.1 million in 2013 from $998.3 million in 2012. The year-over-year decrease in net income - Omnicom Group Inc. is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per common share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased 2.8% to $3.71 in 2013, as compared to $3.61 in 2012 due to the factors described above, as well as the slight reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding. The reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of repurchases of our common stock through the second quarter of 2013, net of stock option exercises, shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan and shares issued upon the conversion of our 2033 Notes and 2038 Notes. In connection with the proposed merger with Publicis, in the third quarter of 2013 we suspended repurchases of our common stock. Excluding the after-tax effect of the merger expenses, net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2013 was $1,026.0 million and diluted net income per common share - Omnicom Group Inc. was $3.84.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Sources and Requirements

The majority of our non-discretionary cash requirements is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand. Working capital is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our Senior Notes, recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations, as well as contingent purchase price obligations (earn-outs) for acquisitions made in prior years. 

Our principal discretionary cash uses include dividend payments to common shareholders, capital expenditures, payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. In the second quarter of 2014, following the termination of the proposed merger with Publicis, we resumed repurchases of our common stock. Our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand, as well as, if needed, other available sources of funding, such as issuing commercial paper, borrowing under our $2.5 billion credit line, or Credit Agreement, or other long-term borrowings to finance these activities. We expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund both our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending through 2015. However, we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist.

We have a seasonal cash requirement normally peaking during the second quarter of the year primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation, income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations. This typically results in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year.

 Our cash and cash equivalents decreased $322.4 million to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2014, from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2013. The components of the decrease for 2014 are (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Principal cash sources and principal cash uses amounts are Non-GAAP financial measures. These amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities, including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes. This presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our statement of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding the primary sources and primary uses of our cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements.

Cash Management

We manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in North America, Europe and Asia. The treasury centers are managed by our wholly-owned finance subsidiaries. Each day, operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center. Likewise, operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center. The treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties. To the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity, they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted credit lines, the Credit Agreement or issue up to a total of $2 billion of U.S. Dollar-denominated commercial paper. This process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively, as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes. In countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis, we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines. 

As discussed in Cash Sources and Requirements, cash and cash equivalents decreased $322.4 million from December 31, 2013. Short-term investments decreased $16.0 million from December 31, 2013. Short-term investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle, generally one year.

At December 31, 2014, total cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion, of which our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $1.4 billion. The majority of the cash is available to us, net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the United States. Changes in international tax rules or changes in U.S. tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

We have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each financial institution. In countries where we conduct treasury operations, generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of the financial institutions that are party to our Credit Agreement. These financial institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings. In countries where we do not conduct treasury operations, we ensure that all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards.

Our net debt position, which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, increased $868.9 million at December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the excess of principal cash uses in excess of principal cash sources of $410.3 million, as described above in Cash Sources and Requirements, a decrease in foreign cash balances of $273.9 million resulting from the translation of local currencies to U.S. Dollars and increases to net debt related to non-cash changes in the interest rate swaps and other items of $184.7 million. The components of net debt for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

24

Net debt as reconciled above, is a Non-GAAP financial measure. This presentation, together with the comparable U.S. GAAP measures, reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in July 2014, we redeemed our outstanding Convertible Notes due 2032 for $252.7 million in cash and in June 2013, we redeemed our outstanding Convertible Notes due 2033 and the Convertible Notes due 2038 for $406.7 million in cash. In October 2014, we issued $750 million principal amount of our 2024 Notes. The proceeds from the issuance were $747.6 million before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. The issuance of the 2024 Notes, subsequent to the redemption of the convertible notes, essentially restored our financial leverage to approximate historical levels.

On May 1, 2014, we entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the $1.25 billion principal amount of the 2022 Notes and, on September 29, 2014, we entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the $1 billion principal amount of the 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the 2022 Notes and the 2020 Notes attributable to changes in the benchmark LIBOR interest rate. Under the swap agreements, we receive fixed interest rate payments equal to the coupon interest rate on the 2022 Notes and the 2020 Notes and pay a variable interest rate on the total principal amount of the notes, equal to three month LIBOR in arrears, plus a spread of 1.05% on the 2022 Notes and a spread of 2.16% on the 2020 Notes. The swaps qualify and are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. The swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 Notes and the 2020 Notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. Gains and losses attributed to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the 2022 Notes and the 2020 Notes attributed to changes in the benchmark interest rate. 

Debt Instruments and Related Covenants

We have committed and uncommitted credit lines. On July 31, 2014, we amended the Credit Agreement to extend the term to July 31, 2019. We have the ability to classify borrowings under the Credit Agreement as long-term. In addition, we can issue up to $2 billion of commercial paper.

We typically fund our day-to-day liquidity by issuing commercial paper. Also, we may borrow under our uncommitted credit lines or Credit Agreement to fund our day-to-day liquidity. At December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

Commercial paper activity for the three years ended December 31, 2014 was (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2014, short-term borrowings of $7.2 million represent bank overdrafts and credit lines of our international subsidiaries. These bank overdrafts and credit lines are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities.

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a Leverage Ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12-month period (under the Credit Agreement, EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and an Interest Coverage Ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12-month period. At December 31, 2014 we were in compliance with these covenants, as our Leverage Ratio was 2.0 times and our Interest Coverage Ratio was 12.6 times. The Credit Agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock.

25

S&P rates our long-term debt BBB+ and Moody’s rates our long-term debt Baa1. Our short-term debt credit ratings are A2 and P2 by the respective rating agencies. Our outstanding Senior Notes and Credit Agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event our debt credit ratings are downgraded.

Omnicom Capital Inc., or OCI, our wholly-owned finance subsidiary, together with us, is a co-obligor under all the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are a joint and several liability of us and OCI and we unconditionally guarantee OCI’s obligations with respect to the Senior Notes. OCI provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries. OCI’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of OCI or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. Our Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.

At December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our debt and the amount available under the Credit Agreement were (in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Credit Markets and Availability of Credit

We will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures and we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients. We believe that these actions, in addition to operating cash flow and the availability of our Credit Agreement, are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending through 2015.

In funding our day-to-day liquidity, we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market. We expect to continue funding our day-to-day liquidity through the commercial paper market. However, disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads. To mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our day-to-day liquidity we may use our uncommitted credit lines or borrow under our Credit Agreement. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets.

26

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of our business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings. The following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual obligations at December 31, 2014 were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial commitments at December 31, 2014 were (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice, certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs). Contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations.

The unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was $270.4 million at December 31, 2014. In 2014, we contributed $3.2 million to our defined benefit pension plans and paid $9.2 million in benefits for our postemployment arrangements. We do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2015.

The liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid. We have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities.

In the normal course of our business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services.

Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

27

In addition, methods of managing the risk of payment defaults, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.
