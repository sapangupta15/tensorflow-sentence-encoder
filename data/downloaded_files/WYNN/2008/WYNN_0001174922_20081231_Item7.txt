ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview  

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened on April 28, 2005, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort located adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008, and Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), which opened on September 6, 2006. We have also commenced construction of Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We believe Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are the preeminent destination casino resorts on the Strip in Las Vegas. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, we were solely a development stage company.  

Our Resorts  

The following table sets forth information about our operating properties as of February 2009:

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas  

We opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas on December 22, 2008. This resort is located on the Las Vegas Strip, immediately adjacent to and connected with Wynn Las Vegas. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas currently features:  

       An approximately 72,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons and a sports book;  

       Luxury hotel accommodation in 2,034 all-suite rooms;  

       Twelve food and beverage outlets;  

       Approximately 27,000 square feet of high-end brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Hermes, Chanel and Rock & Republic;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities including swimming pools, private cabanas and a full service spa and salon; and  

       A showroom, nightclub and lounges.  

Wynn Macau  

We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006 and we completed an expansion of this resort in December 2007. Wynn Macau currently features:  

       An approximately 205,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons and a poker room;  

       Luxury hotel accommodations in 600 rooms and suites;  

       Casual and fine dining in five restaurants;  

       Approximately 46,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Bvlgari, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Fendi, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu, Zegna and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and spa; and  

       Lounges and meeting facilities.  

We have commenced construction on a further expansion of Wynn Macau that will add a fully-integrated resort hotel named Encore at Wynn Macau, with approximately 400 luxury suites and four villas, as well as additional VIP gaming areas, food and beverage and retail amenities. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in 2010.  

In response to our evaluation of Wynn Macau and the reactions of our guests, we have and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to the property.  

We operate Wynn Macau under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002.  

Future Development  

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this property in the future; due to the current economic environment and certain restrictions in our credit facilities, we have no immediate plans to develop this property.  

37  

Table of Contents 

We have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres on Cotai and are awaiting final governmental approval of this concession. No construction timeline or budget have been prepared.  

Current Economic and Operating Environment  

Due to a number of factors affecting consumers, including a slowdown in global economies, contracting credit markets, and reduced consumer spending, and new U.S. political leadership, the outlook for the gaming, travel, and entertainment industries both domestically and abroad remains highly uncertain. Auto traffic into Las Vegas, airline capacity and air travel to McCarran International airport have declined, resulting in lower casino volumes and a reduced demand for hotel rooms. This slow down was particularly significant in the fourth quarter of 2008 and has continued into the first quarter of 2009. Based on our experience in 2008 and current market conditions, we believe that Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas will continue to experience lower than historical hotel occupancy rates, room rates, casino volumes and accordingly lower departmental profitability. As a result of the current economic conditions, we have increasingly focused on efficiency initiatives that we began implementing at our Las Vegas properties and corporate in early 2009. These initiatives include reductions in pay for salaried employees in Las Vegas, reduced work weeks for full-time hourly employees, a substantial reduction of 2009 bonus accruals and a suspension of the employer match to the 401(k) contributions. We expect that these initiatives, along with other operational efficiencies, will save approximately $75-$100 million annually. We are continually reviewing the cost and efficiencies at our operating properties and corporate to identify further opportunities to reduce costs during these uncertain economic times. Wynn Macau has also been impacted by the slowing global economy and visa restrictions implemented in September 2008.  

The factors described above accelerated through 2008 with fourth quarter results in Las Vegas significantly weaker than 2007. Additionally, in early 2009, we have experienced cancellation and attrition of group business at greater than historical levels.  

Results of Operations  

Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons:  

       On September 6, 2006, we opened Wynn Macau;  

       On September 11, 2006, Wynn Macau completed the sale of a Macau subconcession right and recognized a pre-tax gain of $899.4 million;  

       On December 24, 2007, we opened an expansion at Wynn Macau; and  

       On December 22, 2008, we opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include a full year of operations for the expansion at Wynn Macau and 10 days of operations for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a full year of operations for Wynn Las Vegas and 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau. In addition, we believe that our operating results at Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2008 have been adversely impacted by the weakened global economy. Disruptions in the global financial and stock markets and reduced levels of consumer spending have and may continue to adversely impact our financial results. In addition, as noted above, visa restrictions have placed certain limitations on visitation to Macau. These restrictions have and will continue to adversely impact visitation to Macau by residents of mainland China.

The table below displays our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reliance on only three properties (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in three properties, many of our customers are high-end gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.  

Operating Measures  

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented. Casinos generally record table games win as a percentage of either drop or turnover and slot win as a percentage of handle. In our casino operations at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, table games win is recorded as a percentage of drop. However, in our casino operations at Wynn Macau, we separate table play into two distinct classifications. Our Macau VIP casino segment records table games win as a percentage of turnover, whereas our general casino records win as a percentage of drop.  

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:  

       Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.  

       Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box.  

       Turnover is the sum of all losing Rolling Chip wagers within our Wynn Macau VIP program.  

       Rolling Chips are identifiable chips that are used to track VIP wagering volume (turnover) for purposes of calculating incentives.  

       Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.  

       Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.  

       Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.  

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 are comprised of $2,261.9 million in casino revenues (75.7% of total net revenues) and $725.4 million of net non-casino revenues (24.3% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were comprised of $1,949.9 million in casino revenues (72.6% of total net revenues) and $737.6 million of net non-casino revenues (27.4% of total net revenues). Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008, did not significantly impact our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Table of Contents 

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $2,261.9 million represents a $312 million (or 16%) increase from casino revenues of $1,949.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. At Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, we experienced a $162.6 million decrease in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a 7.1% decrease in drop and a decrease in our table games win percentage. Our table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 20.0%, which was below the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 25.3% for the prior year. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased 12.9% during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. As noted earlier, we believe the decrease in casino volumes reflect the overall slowdown in the global economy partially offset by the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In the fourth quarter of 2008, casino revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, declined 43.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of a decrease in table games drop of 20.2% and a decline in our table games win percentage to 15.3% compared to 23.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased 22.7% during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  

Casino revenues at Wynn Macau increased $474.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the prior year. At Wynn Macau, we experienced a 47.4% increase in turnover in the VIP casino segment and our win as a percent of turnover was 3%, which is at the high end of our expected range of 2.7% to 3% compared to 3.1% in the prior year. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play. In our general casino at Wynn Macau, drop increased 14.2% when compared to the prior year and the table games win percentage was 19.6%, which is within the expected range of 18% to 20%. The table game win percentage at Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 19%. Slot handle at Wynn Macau increased 79.5% compared to the prior year and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. The increase in casino revenue at Wynn Macau is a result of growth during the first nine months of the year in the Macau market as well as our casino expansion which opened in December 2007. We expect that this rapid growth in the Macau market will slow due to the overall slowdown in the global economy and visa restrictions that went into effect in September 2008 which limit visitation to Macau by certain residents of mainland China.  

For the year ended December 31, 2008, total room revenues were approximately $326.7 million, a $12.7 million decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Room revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased approximately $17.2 million compared to the prior year due to lower occupancy and lower rates, while room revenue at Wynn Macau increased approximately $4.5 million due to increased rates. In the fourth quarter of 2008, room revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, declined by 14% as our occupancy percentage declined 14.6% and the average daily rate declined 6%, all compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Room rates have continued to decline as the economic slowdown reduces demand for our product.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue for Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $358.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $147.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.2 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $56 million. Other non-gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $354 million, retail revenues of approximately $123.4 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $64.5 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $57.3 million. The increase in food and beverage revenues and retail revenues were primarily driven by our Macau operations and to a lesser extent 10 days of operations of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by decreases at Wynn Las Vegas due to the economic factors noted earlier. General growth in the Macau market and our expansion, which opened in December 2007 (including additional retail outlets), were primarily responsible for the increases. As noted earlier, we do not expect this growth to continue in the general Macau market due to the slowdown in the global economy, visa restrictions and increased casino and hotel capacity recently introduced or expected to be introduced in the near future to the market. Entertainment revenues increased approximately $10.9 million from Le Rêve at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by a decrease of $9.2 million due to the closure of Spamalot in mid-July 2008. Together with the producers, we elected to end Spamalots run at Wynn Las Vegas in July 2008 pursuant to the terms of our contract. We have renovated the theater and on February 10, 2009, it reopened as the Encore Theater featuring Danny Gans.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,491 million, rooms expenses of $78.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $207.3 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.9 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $319.3 million and approximately $49.4 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2007, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,168.1 million, room expenses of $83.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $212.6 million, entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.1 million, general and administrative expenses of approximately $310.8 million and approximately $36.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased over the prior year primarily related to the increased revenue at Wynn Macau as noted above, including the 39 percent gross win tax on casino revenues. General and administrative expenses have increased primarily related to the opening of our expansion of Wynn Macau in December 2007, offset by a decrease in employee bonuses in Las Vegas. The provision for doubtful accounts increased during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in reserves established in light of the current global economic uncertainty.  

Pre-opening costs  

Pre-opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $72.4 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2007. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. Pre-opening costs related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas ceased once it opened on December 22, 2008.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $262.8 million, an increase of $42.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to (i) depreciation expense associated with the opening of the expansion of Wynn Macau, a portion of which opened in September 2007, and the remainder which opened in December 2007; (ii) shortened estimated lives, beginning in March 2008, of certain hotel room furniture, fixtures and equipment at Wynn Las Vegas based on a planned room renovation; and (iii) the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In light of current economic conditions, the room renovation at Wynn Las Vegas has been postponed.

Table of Contents 

During the construction of our properties, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Property charges and other  

Based upon our evaluation of our completed properties and the reactions of our guests, we have made and continue to make enhancements and refinements to our properties. Costs relating to assets retired or abandoned as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts are expensed as property charges. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $32.6 million compared to approximately $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $17.8 million of costs associated with Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas which closed in mid-July 2008. Together with the producers, we elected to end the shows run at Wynn Las Vegas pursuant to the contract. The charge includes production rights that were included in intangible assets, show production costs that were included in other assets and certain other property and equipment. We also incurred a charge of $3.6 million related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space at Wynn Macau to begin construction on a new restaurant. The remaining property charges were related to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the following charges at Wynn Macau: (a) a $10 million charge for the abandonment of our parking garage to make way for Encore at Wynn Macau, (b) a $10.2 million charge related to abandonment costs for portions of the main kitchen, warehouse and restaurants to enable the main casino to be connected with the expansion that opened in December 2007, (c) a $22.1 million charge related to significant casino and retail reconfigurations in the expansion that opened in December 2007, and (d) a $15.5 million charge related to the abandonment of a theater. The remaining property charges were related to renovations to portions of the Le Rêve Theater, the abandonment of a marquee sign and the conversion of two retail outlets and a nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas, as well as the remodeling of certain areas at Wynn Macau. Offsetting these charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a gain of $9.4 million on the sale of a company aircraft.  

We expect to continue to remodel and make enhancements at our properties.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income decreased by $25.8 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates as compared to the prior year. During 2008, the Companys short-term investment strategy was primarily to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments were primarily in investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $172.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $87.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $143.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $44.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest expense increased approximately $43.4 million due to borrowings under the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility drawn in late 2007, approximately $24.1 million related to the additional $400 million Wynn Las Vegas first mortgage notes issued in November 2007 and approximately $12 million net on borrowings from our Wynn Las Vegas, Wynn Macau and other credit facilities. These increases were offset   

42  

Table of Contents 

 by approximately $7.8 million less interest expense due to the conversion of the Debentures in July 2007 and an increase of $42.8 million in capitalized interest related to our construction activities. In future periods, interest expense will increase significantly as we no longer capitalize such costs related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded a net expense of approximately $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to the net decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net expense of $6 million due to the net decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

In November 2008, the Company purchased $625 million principal amount of its outstanding loans under the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility at a discounted price of 95.375%. This resulted in the retirement of $625 million of principal for a payment of $596.1 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $22.3 million on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and fees.  

Other represents the loss recognized in connection with foreign currency remeasurements of assets and liabilities in Macau that are not denominated in the local currency.  

Income Taxes  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a current tax provision of $1.9 million and a deferred tax benefit of $62.8 million.  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company completed a study of the taxes, levies and obligations assessed on operations of Wynn Macau under Macau law and its Macau Gaming Concession. As a result, the Company recognized tax benefits of $721.6 million (net of valuation allowance increases) for foreign tax credits applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau. Of the $721.6 million, $650.6 was used to offset 2008 U.S. income tax expense incurred as a result of the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and $71.0 million (net of valuation allowance) is recorded as deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has no earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested.  

Our effective tax rate/(benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2008, was (40.8%). This rate was 75.8 percentage points lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 35%, primarily due to the repatriation of foreign earnings and related foreign tax credits, a domestic operating loss, and the tax holiday applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau, S.A..  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $27.7 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies (at a rate equal to 39%) in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were comprised of $1,949.9 million in casino revenues (72.6% of total net revenues) and $737.6 million of net non-casino revenues (27.4% of total net revenues). Net

Table of Contents 

 revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of $800.6 million in casino revenues (55.9% of total net revenues) and $631.7 million of net non-casino revenues (44.1% of total net revenues). The quality of our resorts non-casino amenities, combined with providing guests an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in our properties ADR as well as increased the length of casino play, but the majority of revenue from Wynn Macau continues to be generated in the casino segment.  

Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $1,949.9 million represents approximately a $1,149.3 million (or 143.6%) increase from casino revenues of $800.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The year ended December 31, 2007 includes a full year of Wynn Macaus operations, compared to only 117 days in 2006. At Wynn Las Vegas, we experienced a 14.6% increase in drop for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 25.3% was above the expected range of 21% to 24%. Table games win percentage was 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas increased less than 1% during the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Wynn Macaus win percentage for the VIP casino segment of 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, was just above the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%. The average table games win percentage at the general casino at Wynn Macau of 19% was at the top of the expected range of 17% to 19%. Wynn Macaus slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%.  

For the year ended December 31, 2007, room revenues were approximately $339.4 million, which represents a $56.3 million (or 19.9%) increase over the $283.1 million generated in the year ended December 31, 2006. Wynn Macau generated $38.8 million of this increase in room revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007, its first full year of operations. The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $354 million, retail revenues of approximately $123.4 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $64.5 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $57.3 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $309.8 million, retail revenues of approximately $86.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.3 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $52 million. The full year of operations at Wynn Macau during 2007 compared to only 117 days in 2006 was the primary contributor to the increase in the food and beverage, retail and other revenues. Entertainment revenues decreased slightly due to the closure of the Le Réve theater during March 2007 for renovations.  

Departmental, administrative and other expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2007, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,168.1 million, rooms expenses of $83.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $212.6 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.1 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of

Table of Contents 

 approximately $310.8 million and approximately $36.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2006, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $439.9 million, room expenses of $73.9 million, food and beverage expenses of $194.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $134.5 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $231.5 million and approximately $21.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The increase in expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations of Wynn Macau, including the 39 percent gross win tax on casino revenue, and increases in Wynn Las Vegas expenses commensurate with the increase in revenues.  

Pre-opening costs  

Pre-opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $7.1 million decreased by $55.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to advertising costs associated with the opening of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas as well as costs related to Encore and the expansion of Wynn Macau.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $219.9 million increased by $44.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a full year of depreciation expense associated with Wynn Macau as well as the placement into service of Wynn Macaus expansion.  

During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly.  

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Contract termination fee  

In February 2006, we agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive Las Vegas run at Wynn Las Vegas Broadway Theater at the end of May 2006. To terminate the contract, we paid a termination fee of $5 million.  

Property charges and other  

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau properties and the reactions of our guests, we have made and continue to make enhancements and refinements to our properties. Costs relating to assets retired or abandoned as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $70.2 million have been expensed as property charges. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the following charges at Wynn Macau: (a) a $10 million charge for the abandonment of our parking garage to make way for Encore at Wynn Macau, (b) a $10.2 million charge related to abandonment costs for portions of the main kitchen, warehouse and restaurants to enable the main casino to be connected with the expansion that opened in December 2007, (c) a $22.1 million charge related to significant casino and retail reconfigurations in the expansion that opened in December 2007, and (d) a $15.5 million charge related to the abandonment of a theater. The remaining property charges were related to renovations to portions of the Le Rêve Theater, the abandonment of a marquee sign and the conversion of two

 retail outlets and a nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas, as well as the remodeling of certain areas at Wynn Macau. Offsetting these charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 is a gain of $9.4 million on the sale of a company aircraft.  

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar, improved public baccarat space and private baccarat salons and converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories at Wynn Las Vegas. In December 2006, Wynn Macau donated an early Ming dynasty vase to the Macau Museum. We purchased the vase in May 2006 for approximately $10.1 million. The vase had been on public display at Wynn Macau prior to its donation to the museum. The $10.1 million expense for the donation of the Ming Vase is included in Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income increased by $0.2 million to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Interest expense was $143.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $44.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $148 million, net of capitalized interest of $29.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total interest cost increased approximately $10.7 million due to our $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility, approximately $4.4 million related to the additional $400 million Wynn Las Vegas first mortgage notes issued in November 2007 and approximately $2.0 million related to borrowings under our existing credit facilities and other debt. These increases were offset by approximately $6.2 million less interest due to the conversion of the Debentures in July 2007, as well as an increase of $15.1 million in capitalized interest related to our construction activities.  

Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded an expense of approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded a gain of $1.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Gain on sale of subconcession right  

On March 4, 2006, we entered into an agreement with Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (PBL) pursuant to which we agreed to sell to PBL for $900 million, the right to negotiate with the government of Macau for a subconcession to allow PBL to operate casinos in Macau.  

On September 8, 2006, the government of Macau approved the subconcession and on September 11, 2006, PBL paid $900 million in cash to Wynn Macau, S.A. for the subconcession right. As a result of the sale and the subconcession awarded to PBL by the government of Macau, we have no continuing rights or obligations with respect to the subconcession. All rights and obligations under the subconcession are between PBL and the government of Macau. The proceeds from this sale, net of related costs, are recorded as gain on sale of subconcession right, net in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006.  

Income taxes  

Our effective tax rate of 21.1% was lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 35% primarily due to the portion of Macau earnings that we consider permanently invested abroad, the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign income, and the tax holiday applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau S.A. as described below.  

46  

Table of Contents 

Effective December 31, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $26.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in such taxes. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and our casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flow from Operations  

Net cash provided from operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $523.2 million compared to $659.2 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.  

Capital Resources  

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations, debt service and retirement, development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to our properties, funding the remaining construction and retention payables related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (approximately $202 million) and to support the development and construction costs of Encore at Wynn Macau. Approximately $662.3 million of our cash balance is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had availability under our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility of $500 million. On February 4, 2009, we borrowed this remaining availability of $500 million under the Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility and increased our cash balances accordingly. Except for scheduled quarterly payments on two notes payable, we have no outstanding debt maturities until June 2010. We believe that cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2009. However, due to the negative business trends discussed herein, our Las Vegas and Wynn Macau cash flows from operations may continue to significantly decrease which may require additional financing. We cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.  

Cash and cash equivalents include investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and bank time deposits, all with maturities of less than 90 days.  

Investing Activities  

Capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and related primarily to the construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Macau.  

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas  

On April 28, 2006, we commenced construction on Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened on December 22, 2008. Total costs of the project did not exceed our project budget of approximately $2.3 billion for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and related capital improvements. The project has been funded with proceeds from our Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities and operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas. To the extent additional funds are required to pay the remaining construction and retention payables or other needs, we anticipate that we will fund these amounts by additional equity contributions to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Wynn Resorts made $100 million of such contributions.  

Encore at Wynn Macau  

In June 2007, we commenced construction on Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. Encore at Wynn Macau is a second hotel tower for Wynn Macau situated on top of a new low-rise podium. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in 2010.  

47  

Table of Contents 

Design of the project continues to progress and current construction activities as of February 2009 include the following:  

       The tower portion of the low-rise podium is under construction and the tower has reached the 41st floor;  

       Exterior glass installation has reached the 20th floor;  

       Interior fit-out has commenced;  

       The basement structure has been completed; and  

       The central plant (located on the roof of Wynn Macau) is complete.  

In July 2007, Wynn Macau S.A. issued a notice to proceed and on November 8, 2007, executed a guaranteed maximum price contract for $347.8 million with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as the general contractor for the construction of the Encore at Wynn Macau.  

We expect total development and construction costs to be approximately $700 million for Encore at Wynn Macau. We anticipate that the project budget will be funded from our cash flow from operations at Wynn Macau and funds drawn on February 4, 2009 from our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facilities.  

As of December 31, 2008, we had incurred approximately $202 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.  

Financing Activities  

Wynn Resorts, Limited  

On June 6, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion. On July 10, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $500 million to the previously announced equity repurchase program bringing the total authorized to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 10,915,633 shares at a net cost of $940.1 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program.  

Restricted cash decreased approximately $500 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, as such cash was used to purchase shares of our stock as discussed above.  

On June 21, 2007, we entered into a $1 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan). The Term Loan was available to fund (a) our equity repurchase program announced on June 7, 2007 and (b) up to $350 million for general corporate purposes. All amounts under this facility were borrowed as of December 31, 2007 and no additional amounts are available. On November 26, 2008, we purchased $625 million of the loans at a discounted price of 95.375%, resulting in the retirement of $625 million of principal at a cost of $596.1 million. The remaining $375 million will mature and be payable on June 21, 2010.  

At our election, the Term Loan accrues interest at either LIBOR or a Base Rate, plus a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of nine months or longer. Base Rate loans bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its prime rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus  1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on Base Rate loans are payable quarterly in arrears. The borrowing margin is 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1% for Base Rate loans, if our net liquidity is equal to or greater than $400 million and 2.50%   

48  

Table of Contents 

 for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans, if our net liquidity is less than $400 million. For borrowings under the Term Loan, we have historically elected interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% on the outstanding balance.  

On November 18, 2008, we completed a secondary common stock offering of 8 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $344.3 million. These funds were included in our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2008.  

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas  

As of December 31, 2008, our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities consist of a $900 million revolving credit facility (the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver) and $225 million term loan facility (the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan) (together, the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities). For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan we have historically elected Eurodollar loans which bear interest at the 1-month LIBOR and include a margin of 1.875% on that outstanding balance. We had a $200 million notional amount interest rate swap to essentially fix the interest on $200 million of the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan at the rate of 5.7% per annum that expired in December 2008. (For further information, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk.)  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we borrowed $879.5 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We also have $20.1 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. Consequently, as of December 31, 2008, approximately $0.4 million remained available under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver for future borrowings. For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver, we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at the 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.625% on the outstanding balance. Beginning June 30, 2009, the margin will fluctuate between a range of 1 to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, an annual rate of 0.375% on the daily average of unborrowed availability. Beginning June 30, 2009, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability is based on our leverage ratio and will range from an annual rate of 0.25% to 0.50%.  

The $900 million Wynn Las Vegas Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on August 15, 2011. The Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan will mature in two installments: $112.5 million will be payable on September 30, 2012 and the remaining $112.5 million will be payable on August 15, 2013.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.  

On September 17, 2008, Wynn Las Vegas entered into a third amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 15, 2006, as amended April 9, 2007 and as further amended October 31, 2007. This amendment, among other things, provides Wynn Las Vegas with additional flexibility with respect to its financial covenants and related financial calculations.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the ability to sell assets, make capital expenditures, enter into capital leases, make loans or other investments and incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we were required by the financial covenants to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, not greater than 5.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2008, and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 1.40 to 1. Management believes that we were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is 5.00 to 1, 8.25 to 1, 7.75 to 1 and 7.50 to 1 for each of the reporting periods ending March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009, September 30,   

49  

Table of Contents 

 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is 1.35 to 1 for the reporting period ending March 31, 2008, and then increases to 1.75 to 1 for the reporting periods ending June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, and 2.00 to 1 for the reporting period ending December 31, 2009.  

Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau  

On June 27, 2007, Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A., amended its credit facility, dated September 14, 2005 (Amended Common Terms Agreement), and entered into other related amendments and agreements with a syndicate of lenders. The Amended Common Terms Agreement and related agreements took effect on June 29, 2007 and expanded availability under Wynn Macau, S.A.s existing senior bank facility from $764 million to $1.550 billion, in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars, including a $550 million equivalent fully-funded senior term loan facility (the Wynn Macau Term Loan), and a $1 billion senior revolving credit facility (the Wynn Macau Revolver) (together the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement.  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we borrowed approximately $500 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver which left remaining availability of $500 million. We borrowed this remaining availability of $500 million on February 4, 2009, which was added to our cash balances.  

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%.  

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, we were required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, not greater than 4.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2008, and Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that we were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008. The Leverage Ratio increases to not greater than 5.00 to 1 for all reporting periods in 2009.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $20.1 million.

Contractual Obligation and Commitments  

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2008 (amounts in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [1] On February 4, 2009 we borrowed the remaining availability of $500 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver. The Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012.  

 [2] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2008. Such rates are at historical lows as of December 31, 2008 and have been very volatile in recent months. Actual rates will vary.  

 [3] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for aircraft purchases, land concession and fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 17 Income Taxes, of this report, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, on January 1, 2007. We had $120.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2008.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments significantly restrict the ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; although the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of the subconcession sale and, provided certain conditions are met, earnings and loan proceeds. Further, the $1 billion Term Loan places various restrictions on the ability to pay dividends.  

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and to the extent additional funds are required, with additional contributions from Wynn Resorts or additional indebtedness to be incurred by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. We cannot assure you that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future contributions from Wynn Resorts or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs. We expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with existing cash and operating cash flow. However, we cannot assure you that such operating cash flows and existing cash will be sufficient to do so. We may seek to refinance all or a portion of   

51  

Table of Contents 

 our indebtedness on or before maturity. Continued volatility in the capital markets may affect our ability to refinance debt or access those markets for additional borrowings or may increase costs associated with borrowing funds. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.  

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.  

Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.  

Credit Rating  

As of February 26, 2009, the Company had a rating of BB with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors and a rating of Ba3 with a negative outlook by Moodys Investors Service. For future borrowings, any decrease in our corporate rating could result in an increase in borrowing costs.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.  

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates  

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of our properties, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our properties open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs. Start-up costs relating to Encore at Wynn Macau will be charged to pre-opening costs until it is completed and opened.  

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our properties, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our properties, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets.  

52  

Table of Contents 

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.  

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss.  

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. While offered, the issuance of credit at Wynn Macau is less significant when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at Wynn Las Vegas are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.  

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.  

As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, approximately 78% and 65% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries.  

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable is due to a change in our reserve estimates effective September 2008, as a result of the current global economic uncertainty. Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by our employees regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, approximately 29% and 25% respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at Wynn Macau.  

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes in a regions economy or legal system.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income or comprehensive income, as applicable. As of December 31, 2008, changes in the swap fair values are being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.  

Share-Based Compensation  

SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method and use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments issued. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.  

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share-Based Payment to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).

Significant Judgmental Accruals  

We estimate liabilities for certain self-insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as it believes necessary.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we accumulated significant net operating losses, which generated significant deferred tax assets. Because of our limited operating history, we previously fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. On September 11, 2006, we recorded a gain of $899.4 million on the sale of the subconcession right. Accordingly we determined that a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets had become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109.  

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which we adopted on January 1, 2007. The Interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, our income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by SFAS No. 5.  

FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. FIN 48s use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in SFAS No. 109 (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).  

The tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard, the tax position must be derecognized. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we will recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.  

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2008 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $27.7

 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, which defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the entitys financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We partially adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008 and expect to adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2009. The partial adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 (revised) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The revision is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under U.S. GAAP with international accounting rules. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 (revised) is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amount attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosure that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and those of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (the FSP). The FSP requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and does not permit earlier application. However, the transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented and does not grandfather existing instruments. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the FSP will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share (EPS) under the two-class method described in paragraphs 60 and 61 of FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. The FSP will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. All prior period EPS data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of this FSP. We are currently evaluating the impact of this FSP, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.  

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active (FSP 157-3 or the FSP). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (Statement 157), in a market that is not active. The FSP amends Statement 157 to include an example that illustrates key considerations when applying the principles in Statement 157 to financial assets when the market for these instruments is not active.
