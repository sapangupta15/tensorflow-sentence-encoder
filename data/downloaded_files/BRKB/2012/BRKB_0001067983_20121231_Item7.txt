 (1)  Includes earnings of BNSF from February 12.  

 (2)  Includes earnings of Lubrizol from September 16.  

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshires corporate governance efforts, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate tone at the top messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  

Insurance underwriting results in 2012 included after-tax losses of approximately $725 million from Hurricane Sandy. In 2011 and 2010, underwriting results included after-tax losses of approximately $1.7 billion and $600 million, respectively, from catastrophe events occurring in those years. Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses continued to generate significant earnings in 2012. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2012 increased significantly over 2011 due primarily to the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol), which was completed on September 16, 2011. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were mixed, reflecting significant improvements in our carpet business, modest improvements in our other building products businesses in the U.S., and earnings declines in several foreign markets of our manufacturing and service operations.  

In 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $2.2 billion, which included reductions in estimated liabilities under equity index put option contracts, settlements and expirations of credit default contracts and net gains from investment disposals. In 2011, after-tax investment and derivative losses were $521 million, reflecting after-tax losses of $1.2 billion related to increases in liabilities under our equity index put option contracts and other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses of $590 million related to certain equity and fixed maturity securities, partially offset by after-tax investment gains of $1.2 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock investments. In 2010, after-tax investment and derivative gains were $1,874 million, and included a one-time holding gain of $979 million related to our acquisition of BNSF, net gains from the dispositions of investments and net gains from derivative contracts, partially offset by OTTI losses recorded with respect to certain fixed maturity and equity securities. We believe that investment gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. The timing and magnitude of investment and derivative gains and losses has caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

InsuranceUnderwriting  

We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.  

Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income.  

The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results. In 2012, we recorded aggregate pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 billion attributable to Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $2.6 billion, arising primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand in the first quarter, as well as weather related events in the Pacific Rim and the U.S.  

Our periodic underwriting results are regularly affected by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In 2011, we reduced estimated liabilities related to certain retroactive reinsurance contracts which resulted in an increase in pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $875 million. These reductions were primarily due to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $64 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2012 may develop upward or downward in future periods with a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, to pre-tax earnings.  

Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In recent years, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been significant.  

A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $106 billion at December 31, 2012. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.  

Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued)  

GEICO  

Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICOs policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICOs underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Premiums earned in 2012 were approximately $16.7 billion, an increase of $1,377 million (9.0%) over 2011. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 9.0% as a result of a 6.5% increase in policies-in-force and an increase in average premium per policy over the past twelve months. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2012 increased slightly compared with 2011. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2012 were approximately 704,000 greater than at December 31, 2011.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2012 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $687 million (5.7%) over 2011. Our loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) was 75.9% in 2012 and 78.2% in 2011. We incurred losses (net of estimated salvage) of $490 million from Hurricane Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, catastrophe losses were $638 million (3.8 loss ratio points) in 2012 compared to $252 million (1.6 loss ratio points) in 2011. Our loss ratio declined in 2012 as compared to 2011. Claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages were down about one percent, comprehensive coverage frequencies were down about ten percent, excluding Hurricane Sandy, and frequencies for bodily injury coverages were relatively unchanged. In 2012, frequencies were lower in the second half of the year than they were in the first half. Physical damage severities increased in the two to four percent range and bodily injury severities increased in the one to three percent range from 2011.  

Underwriting expenses incurred in 2012 increased $586 million (21.1%) compared with 2011. The increase was primarily the result of a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC). DPAC represents the underwriting costs that are eligible to be capitalized and expensed as premiums are earned over the policy period. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard as of January 1, 2012, GEICO ceased deferring a large portion of its advertising costs. The new accounting standard was adopted on a prospective basis and as a result, DPAC recorded as of December 31, 2011 was amortized to expense over the remainder of the related policy periods in 2012. Policy acquisition costs related to policies written and renewed after December 31, 2011 are being deferred at lower levels than in the past. The new accounting standard for DPAC does not impact the cash basis periodic underwriting costs or our assessment of GEICOs underwriting performance. However, the new accounting standard accelerates the timing of when certain underwriting costs are recognized in earnings. We estimate that GEICOs underwriting expenses in 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard and that, as a result, GEICOs expense ratio (the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2012 would have been less than in 2011.  

Premiums earned in 2011 increased $1,080 million (7.6%) over 2010. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 7.0% as compared to 2010. The increase in policies-in-force in 2011 reflected an increase of 9.4% in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2011 were approximately 709,000 greater than at December 31, 2010.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2011 increased $1,382 million (13.0%) as compared to 2010, increasing at a greater rate than premiums earned. As a result, the loss ratio increased from 74.4% in 2010 to 78.2% in 2011. The increase in the loss ratio in 2011 was primarily due to higher average injury and physical damage severities estimates and increased

 catastrophe losses incurred. In 2011, bodily injury severities estimates generally increased in the three to six percent range over 2010, while physical damage severities increased in the three to five percent range. In 2011, catastrophe losses were $252 million compared with $109 million in 2010. In 2011, underwriting expenses increased $239 million (9.4%) over 2010. The increase reflected additional advertising and increased payroll costs related to generating new business and servicing existing business.  

General Re  

Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Res underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

Property/casualty premiums written in 2012 increased $72 million (2.5%), while premiums earned declined $37 million (1.3%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written increased $158 million (5.4%) compared to 2011, which reflected increased volume in most of our major markets around the globe. Before the effects of currency exchange, premiums earned in 2012 increased $61 million (2.1%) over 2011, which was primarily attributable to an increase in European property treaty business. Price competition in most property and casualty lines persists and the volume of business written in recent years has been less than our capacity. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by not accepting offers to write business where prices are deemed inadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve.  

Property/casualty operations produced net underwriting gains of $399 million in 2012 which consisted of $352 million of gains from our property business and $47 million of gains from casualty/workers compensation business. Our property results included $266 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to Hurricane Sandy, the earthquake in Northern Italy and various tornadoes in the Midwest. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. The underwriting gains from casualty/workers compensation business included favorable run-off of prior years business, offset in part by $105 million of recurring accretion of discounted workers compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts written many years ago.  

Premiums written in 2011 were relatively unchanged from 2010, while premiums earned in 2011 declined $38 million (1.3%) from 2010. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2011 declined $94 million (3.2%) and $132 million (4.4%), respectively, compared with 2010. The declines reflected lower premium volume in North American property treaty business, substantially offset by higher premiums in European property lines and broker market motor liability business.  

Underwriting gains were $7 million in 2011 and consisted of a net underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers compensation business substantially offset by a net underwriting loss of $120 million from property business. Our property results included $861 million of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses were primarily attributable to the earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan, as well as to weather related loss events in the United States, Europe and Australia. The underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers compensation business reflected overall reductions in prior years loss reserve estimates, due generally to lower than expected claim reports from cedants, which was partially offset by $111 million of accretion of discounted workers compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization.

Property/casualty (Continued)  

Underwriting gains were $289 million in 2010 and consisted of gains of $236 million from property business and $53 million from casualty/workers compensation business. The property results included $339 million of catastrophe losses incurred primarily from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes and weather related losses in Europe, Australia and New England, offset by reductions in liability estimates for prior years losses. The underwriting gains of $53 million from casualty/workers compensation business reflected overall reductions in estimated prior years loss reserves, offset in part by $125 million of accretion of discounted workers compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges.  

Life/health  

In 2012, written premiums increased $93 million (3.2%) and earned premiums increased $91 million (3.2%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned increased $239 million (8.2%) and $236 million (8.2%), respectively, compared to 2011. The increases in premiums written and earned can be primarily attributed to increased writings in non-U.S. life business. Life/health operations produced a net underwriting loss of $44 million in 2012. The underwriting results were negatively impacted by a premium deficiency reserve we established on our U.S. long-term care book of business which has been in run-off for almost a decade. In addition, underwriting results were negatively impacted in 2012 by greater than expected claims frequency and duration in the individual and group disability business in Australia.  

Premiums earned in 2011 were $2,875 million, an increase of 5.9% over 2010. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned increased 2.2% over 2010. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to higher volumes of international life business, which represented about 60% of aggregate life/health premiums earned. The life/health operations produced net underwriting gains of $137 million in 2011 and $163 million in 2010. Underwriting results for 2011 included losses of $15 million attributable to the earthquake in Japan. Underwriting results in 2011 and 2010 were impacted by generally lower than expected mortality in the life business.  

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  

Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRGs business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary insurance and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line property/casualty refers to various coverages written on both a quota-share and excess basis and includes a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (Swiss Re) covering substantially all of Swiss Res property/casualty risks incepting between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. The Swiss Re quota-share contract was not renewed in 2013. BHRGs underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and annuity businesses. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Catastrophe and individual risk contracts may provide exceptionally large limits of indemnification and cover catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters) or other property and liability risks. The timing and magnitude of losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business.  

Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written approximated $785 million in 2012, $720 million in 2011 and $584 million in 2010. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and managements assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have constrained the volume of business written in recent years as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant significantly increasing volume. However, we have the

 capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Premiums earned in 2012 from catastrophe and individual risk contracts exceeded 2011 by $65 million (9%), which increased 21% compared with 2010.  

In 2012, catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results reflected estimated losses of $96 million in connection with Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, we incurred estimated losses of approximately $800 million attributable to the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, while in 2010 we incurred estimated losses of $322 million arising from several loss events. Changes in estimated losses attributable to prior years events were relatively insignificant in 2012 and 2011. In 2010, underwriting results were favorably impacted from the reductions of estimated unpaid losses for prior years loss events due to lower than expected reported claims.  

Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. Coverages are generally subject to policy limits. Premiums earned in 2012 derived from several relatively small contracts. Premiums earned under retroactive reinsurance contracts in 2011 included approximately $1.7 billion from a reinsurance contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (AIG). Under the contract, we agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIGs U.S. asbestos liabilities. The agreement provides for a maximum limit of indemnification of $3.5 billion. Premiums earned in 2010 included approximately $2.25 billion from a contract with Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation, and several of its other insurance subsidiaries (collectively the CNA Companies). Under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, BHRG assumed certain asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to an aggregate limit of indemnification of $4 billion.  

Underwriting results attributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded as the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charge balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Deferred charge balances are also adjusted to reflect changes in the timing and amount of actual and re-estimated future loss payments. The recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of loss payments are included in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRGs retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively.  

In 2012, the underwriting loss from retroactive reinsurance contracts was $201 million, which was primarily attributable to deferred charge amortization. In 2012, changes in estimated ultimate unpaid losses with respect to prior years contracts were not significant. In 2011, the net underwriting gain from retroactive reinsurance contracts was $645 million. The net gain reflected the favorable impact of a reduction of approximately $865 million in the estimated liability originally established under an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Re, which was attributable to better than expected loss experience. In 2010, underwriting results benefitted from reductions in liabilities for prior years contracts and slower than expected loss payments. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $18.0 billion at December 31, 2012, $18.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and $18.7 billion as of December 31, 2010.  

Premiums earned from other multi-line property and casualty business included $3.4 billion in 2012, $2.9 billion in 2011 and $2.4 billion in 2010 from the Swiss Re 20% quota-share contract. As previously noted, the Swiss Re quota-share contract expired on December 31, 2012. Unearned premiums as of December 31, 2012 ($1.4 billion) will be earned as the contract runs off, with a majority of that amount to be earned in 2013. Accordingly, multi-line premium volume is expected to decline significantly in 2013. Underwriting results of our other multi-line property/casualty business can be significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses. In 2012, we incurred estimated losses of $268 million from Hurricane Sandy. In 2011 and 2010, other multi-line property and casualty business included estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $933 million and $308 million, respectively. In 2011, the losses were primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and from floods in Thailand, while the losses in 2010 related to the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, the Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and Australian floods. The catastrophe losses in all three years arose primarily under the Swiss Re quota-share contract.

InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued)  

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)  

Multi-line property/casualty underwriting results regularly include foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the changes in the valuation of certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S. based subsidiaries (including liabilities arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts) denominated in foreign currencies as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results included foreign currency transaction losses of $123 million in 2012, gains of $140 million in 2011 and losses of $168 million in 2010.  

Life and annuity premiums earned in 2012 increased $672 million (31%) over 2011, which was attributable to new annuity contracts. Premiums earned in 2011 and 2010 primarily derived from a life reinsurance contract entered into in January 2010 with Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (SRLHA) and a life reinsurance business acquired as of December 31, 2010 from Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.  

In 2012, the life reinsurance business produced underwriting losses of $12 million versus $582 million in 2011 and $83 million in 2010. In 2011, we recorded a pre-tax underwriting loss of $642 million with respect to the SRLHA contract. Mortality rates under that contract have persistently exceeded the assumptions we made at the inception of the contract. During the fourth quarter of 2011, after considerable internal actuarial analysis, our management concluded that future mortality rates are expected to be greater than our original assumptions. As a result, we increased our estimated liabilities for future policyholder benefits to reflect the new assumptions. The liabilities established in connection with the SRLHA contract reflect our best estimates for expected mortality, lapse rates, future premiums on the underlying policies and discount rates. We do not currently believe significant additional net underwriting losses under this contract are likely.  

The annuity business generated underwriting losses of $178 million in 2012, $118 million in 2011 and $114 million in 2010. Annuity underwriting losses reflect the periodic discount accretion of the discounted liabilities established for such contracts as well as adjustments for mortality experience. At December 31, 2012, annuity liabilities were approximately $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion since December 31, 2011, reflecting the aforementioned increase in new business in 2012.  

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  

Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company (MedPro) and Princeton Insurance Company (acquired effective December 31, 2011), providers of healthcare malpractice insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers and healthcare facilities; National Indemnity Companys primary group, writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired Clal U.S. Holdings, which owns GUARD Insurance Group (GUARD), a provider of commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses.  

Premiums earned in 2012 by our various primary insurers were $2,263 million, an increase of $514 million (29%), over 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased volume of workers compensation insurance from the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies and premiums from Princeton Insurance Company and GUARD. Premium volume of certain of our other primary insurers continues to be constrained by market conditions. We have the capacity and desire to write substantially more volume when market conditions improve. In 2012, our primary insurers produced underwriting gains of $286 million, an increase of $44 million (18%) over 2011. Underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned were approximately 13% in 2012 and 14% in 2011.  

Earned premiums by our primary insurance businesses in 2011 were approximately $1.7 billion, which was relatively unchanged from 2010. The underwriting gain in 2011 reflects favorable loss experience at MedPro and Applied Underwriters, including overall reductions of estimated liabilities for prior years losses, partially offset by increased underwriting losses of the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies.

InsuranceInvestment Income  

A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Includes equity method earnings of $50 million in 2010 related to BNSF.  

Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2012 declined $271 million (6%) compared to 2011. The decline reflected the redemptions in 2011 of our investments in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries held 87% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and in General Electric 10% Preferred Stock ($3 billion aggregate investment). Dividends earned by our insurance subsidiaries from these investments were $420 million in 2011. Investment income in 2012 reflected increased dividends earned from our investment in Bank of America 6% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries hold 80% of the $5 billion aggregate investment), which was acquired in September of 2011, and increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings. We continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances currently earning near zero yields. However, our management believes that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and strongly insists on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents.  

Pre-tax investment income in 2011 declined $470 million (9%) compared to 2010. Investment income in 2011 was negatively impacted by redemptions at the end of 2010 and in 2011 of certain investments we made in 2008 and 2009, including the aforementioned investments in Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock, as well as the Swiss Re 12% capital instrument (CHF 3 billion). Our insurance subsidiaries earned dividends from these three investments of $420 million in 2011 compared with approximately $1.0 billion in 2010. In 2011, investment income was favorably impacted by increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings.  

Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $73 billion at December 31, 2012, $70 billion at December 31, 2011 and $66 billion at December 31, 2010. The cost of float, as represented by the ratio of underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative for the last three years, as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year.  

A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 follows. Other investments include investments in Wrigley, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Dow Chemical and Bank of America (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amounts are in millions.

U.S. government obligations are rated AA+ or Aaa by the major rating agencies and approximately 86% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government obligations and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher.

Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities.  

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe)  

We acquired control of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNSF) in February 2010, and its results are included in our consolidated results thereafter. BNSF operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. BNSFs major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF since we acquired control are summarized below, and earnings for the year ending December 31, 2010 is provided for comparison (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues in 2012 were approximately $20.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion (7%) over 2011. Overall, the revenue increase in 2012 reflected higher average revenues per car/unit of approximately 4% as well as a 2% increase in cars/units handled (volume). Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Fuel surcharges in 2012 increased 6% over 2011, and are reflected in average revenue per car/unit.  

The increase in overall volume during 2012 included increases in consumer products (4%) and industrial products (13%), partially offset by declines in coal (6%) and agricultural products (3%). The consumer products volume increase was primarily

 attributable to higher domestic intermodal and automotive volume. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased shipments of petroleum and construction products. The decline in coal unit volume in 2012 was attributed to lower coal demand as a result of low natural gas prices and high utility stockpiles. Agricultural product volume declined in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting lower wheat and corn shipments for export partially offset by higher soybean and U.S. corn shipments.  

Operating expenses in 2012 increased $588 million (4%) compared to 2011. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2012 increased $190 million (4%) over 2011 due to the increased volume as well as wage inflation, partially offset by increased productivity and lower weather-related costs. Fuel expenses in 2012 increased $192 million (4.5%) due to higher fuel prices and increased volume, partially offset by improved fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency in 2011 was negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. Purchased services costs in 2012 increased $156 million (7%) compared to 2011 due primarily to increased volume, increased purchased transportation services of BNSF Logistics, a wholly-owned third party logistics company, and increased equipment maintenance costs, partially offset by lower weather-related costs. Interest expense in 2012 increased $63 million (11%) versus 2011, due principally to higher average outstanding debt balances.  

Revenues for 2011 were approximately $19.5 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.7 billion (16%) over 2010. Revenues from each of the four business groups increased between 8% and 19% as compared to 2010. Overall, the increases in revenues in 2011 reflected a 12% increase in average revenues per car/unit across all four business groups, as well as a 3% increase in the volume of cars/units handled. Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges. Average revenues per car/unit in 2011 included the effects of fuel surcharge increases of 35% in 2011 as compared to 2010.  

The volume increase in 2011 is comprised of increases of 7% in cars/units handled in the consumer products and industrial products groups combined with a 4% decrease in volume for coal products. The consumer products volume increase was attributable primarily to higher domestic intermodal and international volume. The decline in coal unit volume was partially attributable to the impacts of severe flooding along key coal routes. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased steel and sand shipments, as well as increased demand in petroleum products. Agricultural product volume remained relatively unchanged, as higher wheat exports and U.S. corn shipments were mostly offset by declining soybean exports.  

Operating expenses in 2011 were $14.2 billion, representing an increase of $1.9 billion (15%) over 2010. Fuel expenses increased $1.3 billion in 2011 primarily due to higher fuel prices. The remainder of the increase in fuel costs was driven by higher overall freight volumes and severe weather conditions, which negatively impacted efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $311 million, reflecting increased volume, as well as salaries and benefits inflation, increased personnel training costs and flood-related costs. Purchased services expenses increased $49 million due primarily to increased volume and flood-related costs, offset by lower locomotive maintenance costs. Materials and other expenses increased $186 million, reflecting higher locomotive and freight car material costs and increased crew transportation, travel and casualty costs offset by lower environmental costs.  

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican)  

We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican), which operates an international energy business. MidAmericans domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC). MidAmerican also owns two interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In Great Britain, MidAmerican operates two electricity distribution businesses, owned by Northern Powergrid Holdings Company (Northern Powergrid). The rates that utility and natural gas pipeline companies charge customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects, including recently-acquired solar and wind projects, and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2012, PacifiCorps revenues increased $311 million (7%) over revenues in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $244 million, which were due to higher prices approved by regulators across most of PacifiCorps jurisdictions of $222 million, as well as to increased revenues from renewable energy credits. The comparative increase in renewable energy credit revenues in 2012 was attributable in part to higher deferrals of credits in 2011 as a result of a rate case settlement. In 2012, PacifiCorp also experienced generally higher customer load in Utah, which was offset by lower industrial customer load in Wyoming and Oregon, attributable to certain large customers electing to self-generate their own power and by lower residential customer load in Oregon as a result of unfavorable weather.  

PacifiCorps earnings before corporate interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2012 declined $34 million (4%) compared to the corresponding 2011 period. EBIT in 2012 reflected increased operating earnings from higher revenues (from rates and customer loads), which was more than offset by higher energy costs and other operating expenses, as well as increased depreciation and amortization from higher plant in service. In 2012, operating expenses included charges of $165 million related to litigation, fire and other damage claims.  

PacifiCorps revenues in 2011 were $4,639 million, an increase of $121 million (3%) over 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $350 million in retail operating revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $196 million in wholesale and other operating revenues. The increase in retail revenues was due to higher prices approved by regulators and higher customer load. The decrease in wholesale and other revenues was due to a 24% decrease in average prices and a 6% decrease in volumes. Additionally, wholesale and other revenues decreased $57 million due to lower sales and higher deferrals of renewable energy credits. PacifiCorps EBIT in 2011 was $771 million, a decrease of $12 million (2%) from 2010. Increased revenues were more than offset by an overall increase in energy and operating costs, as well as higher net interest expense.  

MECs revenues in 2012 declined $255 million (7%) compared to 2011. In 2012, MECs regulated electric revenues increased 2% to approximately $1.7 billion, while regulated natural gas revenues declined $110 million to $659 million. The decline in natural gas revenues reflected lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold and lower volumes, which was attributable to unseasonably warm weather and other usage factors. Nonregulated and other operating revenues declined $178 million in 2012 compared to 2011, due to generally lower electricity and natural gas prices. MECs EBIT in 2012 declined $43 million (15%) compared to 2011, which reflected lower operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest expense. In 2012, MECs overall operating earnings reflected increased depreciation expense of $56 million and higher general and administrative expenses.  

MECs revenues of $3,530 million in 2011 declined $294 million (8%) from 2010 due to lower regulated electric and gas revenues as well as lower nonregulated and other operating revenues. Regulated retail and wholesale electric revenues declined $117 million (7%), primarily due to a 19% reduction in wholesale volume and due to lower average wholesale prices. Regulated natural gas revenues declined $83 million (10%), primarily due to a 30% decline in wholesale volume. Nonregulated and other operating revenues decreased $112 million (9%), due principally to lower electricity volumes and prices. MECs EBIT of $279

 million in 2011 was unchanged from 2010. The effect of the declines in revenues were essentially offset by lower energy costs, which was driven by lower sales volumes, and to a lesser degree, by lower net interest expense.  

In 2012, natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT declined $15 million and $5 million, respectively, compared to 2011. In 2012, natural gas revenues increased from expansion projects and from higher transportation and storage rates in certain markets, which were more than offset by lower volumes of gas and condensate liquids sales (which are offset in cost of sales) and the impact of contract expirations. In 2012, EBIT also reflected increased depreciation expense, partially offset by lower interest expense. Natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT in 2011 were relatively unchanged from 2010.  

Northern Powergrids revenues in 2012 increased $20 million (2%) while EBIT declined $40 million (9%) compared to 2011. In 2012, revenues were negatively impacted by currency-related declines from a stronger U.S. Dollar. Excluding currency related impacts, distribution revenues increased $28 million in 2012, reflecting higher tariff rates ($76 million), partially offset by the impact of higher regulatory provisions in 2011 ($55 million). Northern Powergrids EBIT in 2012 was negatively affected by increases in pension expense ($44 million) and distribution operating expenses ($21 million), which more than offset the increase in distribution revenues.  

Revenues of Northern Powergrid were $1,016 million in 2011, an increase of $212 million (26%) from 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $197 million in distribution revenues, and to a lesser degree to a weaker U.S. Dollar. EBIT in 2011 was $469 million, an increase of $136 million (41%) over 2010. The increase in EBIT was also primarily due to higher distribution revenues and the weaker U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the impact of a $45 million gain on the sale of a subsidiary in 2010.  

Real estate brokerage revenues in 2012 increased $326 million (32%) and EBIT increased $43 million (110%) over 2011. The revenue increase included $123 million from businesses acquired in 2012. The increase in revenues also reflected a 16% increase in closed sales transactions and higher average home sale prices from existing businesses. The increase in real estate brokerage EBIT in 2012 reflected the impact of business acquisitions in 2012 as well as the aforementioned increase in closed sales transactions.  

Revenues of the real estate brokerage business were $1,007 million in 2011, down 4% from $1,046 million in 2010, primarily due to a 4% decrease in average home sale prices. EBIT of the real estate brokerage business of $39 million was 7% lower than the $42 million in 2010.

Marmon  

Through Marmon, we operate approximately 150 manufacturing and service businesses that operate independently within eleven diverse business sectors. Marmons revenues in 2012 were approximately $7.2 billion, an increase of 3.6% over 2011. Revenue increases attributable to bolt-on acquisitions in the Crane Services, Highway Technologies, Engineered Wire & Cable and Distribution Services sectors were substantially offset by the impact of lower copper prices in the Building Wire and Flow Products sectors. However, significant organic growth occurred within the Distribution Services, Transportation Services & Engineered Products (TSEP), Highway Technologies and Water Treatment sectors. Despite falling steel prices, Distribution Services increased market share in their market niches, driving annual revenues up 5% over 2011. Higher rail fleet utilization and higher rental rates, offset by lower external sales of railroad tank cars, provided most of the TSEP growth and sulfur equipment installations in the Middle East provided the balance. Commercial and heavy haul trailers have driven the increase in Highway Technologies, while projects for the Canadian Tar Sands area provided growth in Water Treatment. These increases were somewhat offset by revenue declines in the Flow Products and Building Wire sectors due to the persistent slowdown in commercial construction. Retail Store Fixtures continued to suffer from a reduction in volume from its major customer, which resulted in a 14% decline in revenues for 2012.  

Pre-tax earnings in 2012 were $1.1 billion, an increase of 14.6% over 2011. Approximately 25% of the overall increase in pre-tax earnings was attributable to bolt-on acquisitions. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, eight of the eleven Marmon business sectors produced increased pre-tax earnings in 2012 compared to 2011. Among the sectors reporting the largest dollar increases in pre-tax earnings were the TSEP, Highway Technologies, Distribution Services and Water Treatment sectors reflecting the aforementioned revenue growth. In addition, Engineered Wire & Cable sectors pre-tax earnings rose 24% attributable to restructuring actions taken in 2011 in the utility and commodity-driven businesses, along with growth in that sectors specialty wire niches. Flow Products, Building Wire and Retail Store Fixtures sectors reported lower 2012 pre-tax earnings consistent with the revenue declines previously discussed. In 2012, consolidated pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 15.9% compared to 14.3% in 2011.  

The improvement in operating results in 2012 reflects the continued emphasis of Marmons business model, which fosters margin growth. Consistent with this model, most of the growth in 2012 was in higher margin sectors that focus on niche markets. In addition, improvements in revenues and pre-tax earnings also generally reflected continued strength in some of Marmons end markets, recent new product introductions and ongoing efforts to control overhead costs.  

Revenues in 2011 were $6.9 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over 2010. An estimated 25% of the aggregate revenue increase was attributed to increased copper prices affecting the Building Wire and Flow Products sectors, where copper cost increases are passed on to customers with little or no margin. Ten of the eleven business sectors produced comparative revenue increases. The only sector reporting a comparative revenue decrease was the Retail Store Fixtures sector, where its largest customer significantly reduced its purchases. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were $992 million, an increase of approximately 22% over 2010. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 increased in all sectors except Retail Store Fixtures consistent with the revenue decline previously discussed. Pre-tax earnings as a percent of revenues were 14.3% in 2011 and 13.6% in 2010.  

McLane Company  

Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLanes business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLanes significant customers include Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors (Empire), based in Georgia and North Carolina, and Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc. (Horizon), based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer. On August 24, 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (MBM). MBM, based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, is a large customized foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains with annual revenues of approximately $6 billion. MBMs revenues and earnings were included in McLanes results beginning as of the acquisition date. Approximately 28% of McLanes consolidated revenues in 2012 were attributable to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLanes periodic revenues and earnings.  

McLanes revenues were approximately $37.4 billion in 2012, an increase of about $4.2 billion (12.5%) over 2011. The increase in revenues was attributable to the MBM acquisition, as well as 6% to 8% revenue increases in McLanes grocery,

 foodservice and beverage business units. The increases in grocery and foodservice revenues reflected manufacturer price increases as well as increased volume. Pre-tax earnings in 2012 were $403 million, an increase of $33 million (9%) over 2011. The overall increase in earnings reflected the increases in revenues as pre-tax margin rates were relatively unchanged.  

McLanes revenues of $33.3 billion in 2011 increased approximately $600 million (2%) over 2010. The increase in revenues in 2011 was partially attributable to the inclusion of the full-year results of Empire and Horizon. Otherwise, revenues in 2011 from the grocery business were relatively unchanged from 2010, while revenues from the foodservice business increased approximately 7% over 2010. Pre-tax earnings in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010 which reflected the inclusion of Empire and Horizon and increased earnings from the grocery business, offset by lower earnings from the foodservice business. In 2011, McLane benefitted from a slight increase in its consolidated gross sales margin, which was offset by increased fuel, trucking and legal and professional costs.  

Other manufacturing  

Our other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel). Also included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles, IMC Metalworking Companies (Iscar), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Other manufacturing businesses also include The Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol), a specialty chemical manufacturer that we acquired on September 16, 2011. Lubrizols revenues and earnings are included in other manufacturing revenues and earnings beginning as of that date.  

Revenues of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 were approximately $26.8 billion, an increase of approximately $5.6 billion (26%) over 2011. Excluding Lubrizol, revenues in 2012 grew 6% over 2011. In 2012, we experienced a revenue increase of 27% from Forest River, which was attributable to increased volume and average sales prices. In 2012, revenues from building products and apparel increased 4% and 5%, respectively, as compared with 2011. However, revenues in 2012 of Iscar and CTB (before the impact of bolt-on acquisitions) declined compared to 2011 as a result of weakness in demand, particularly in non-U.S. markets.  

In 2012, pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of $922 million (38%) over earnings in 2011. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 increased 6% compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings from building products, apparel and Forest River, partially offset by lower earnings from Iscar, CTB and Scott Fetzer. In 2012, our Shaw carpet and flooring business benefited from the impact of price increases at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012, as well as from relatively stable raw material costs in 2012, that resulted in higher margins. Our apparel businesses benefitted from past pricing actions and stabilizing raw material costs. On the other hand, our other businesses that manufacture products that are primarily for commercial and industrial customers, particularly those with significant business in overseas markets, such as CTB and Iscar, were negatively impacted in 2012 by slowing economic conditions in certain of those markets.  

Other manufacturing revenues increased $3.5 billion (20%) in 2011 to $21.2 billion compared with 2010. In 2011, Lubrizol accounted for approximately $1.7 billion of the increase. Otherwise, revenues of our other manufacturing businesses increased 10%. Iscar and CTB in particular experienced strong demand for their products.  

Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were $2.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $486 million (25%) over 2010. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings increased 10% compared to 2010. Increased earnings were generated by Iscar and CTB, which were partially offset by lower earnings of the apparel group and, particularly from the Fruit of the Loom group of businesses, which were negatively impacted by significantly higher cotton costs. Our building products businesses were negatively impacted by slow residential housing construction activity.

Other service  

Our other service businesses include NetJets, the worlds leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,200 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News and the BH Media Group, which includes the Omaha World-Herald acquired at the end of 2011, as well as 26 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.  

Revenues of our other service businesses in 2012 were approximately $8.2 billion, an increase of $737 million (10%) over 2011. The increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the BH Media Group and a comparative revenue increase from TTI, principally due to its bolt-on business acquisitions in 2012. Pre-tax earnings of $966 million in 2012 declined $11 million (1%) from earnings in 2011. Earnings of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011. Earnings of other service businesses in 2012 included earnings of the BH Media Group, which were more than offset by lower earnings from TTI due primarily to weaker customer demand and intensifying price competition over the past year.  

Revenues of our other service businesses were approximately $7.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $586 million (9%) over 2010. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to stronger demand for electronic components (TTI) and pilot training (FlightSafety) and from higher revenues at NetJets. TTI revenues increased 12% as customer demand increased rapidly during the first half of 2011, and then moderated over the second half. FlightSafetys revenues increased approximately 8% due primarily to increases in training demand within the business aviation and regional airline markets, partially offset by lower revenues from government customers. The comparative revenue increases of NetJets reflected revenues related to aircraft operating cost increases that are passed through to customers (with little or no margin), and slight increases in rates. Revenue hours flown in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010.  

Pre-tax earnings were $977 million in 2011, which exceeded 2010 by $72 million (8%). The increase in earnings was driven by higher earnings of FlightSafety, NetJets and TTI, partially offset by lower earnings from Buffalo News. FlightSafetys earnings increased approximately 16%, reflecting increased revenues and ongoing cost containment efforts. NetJets earnings increased 10% primarily attributable to higher revenues and lower aircraft maintenance costs due to a 10% reduction in the size of the fleet, partially offset by comparatively higher impairment charges related to the planned disposition of certain aircraft and fees incurred to cancel certain aircraft purchase commitments. Over the past few years, NetJets has reduced the number of aircraft in its fleet by approximately 20% and lowered its operating cost structure to better match customer demand.  

Retailing  

Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), Sees Candies; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; and Oriental Trading Company (OTC), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties, which we acquired on November 27, 2012.  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2012 from the retailing businesses increased $142 million (4%) and $5 million (2%), respectively, over revenues and earnings in 2011. Increased revenues from the home furnishings and jewelry businesses as well as the inclusion of OTC since November 27 were partially offset by lower revenues from Pampered Chef. Increased earnings of our home furnishings retailers were substantially offset by lower earnings from our jewelry businesses and Pampered Chef.  

Revenues of our retailing businesses were $3.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $133 million (4%) over 2010. Pre-tax earnings were $301 million, an increase of $25 million (9%) over 2010. With the exception of Pampered Chef, each of our retailing businesses generated comparatively higher revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2011.

Finance and Financial Products  

Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment leasing (XTRA), furniture leasing (CORT) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Clayton Homes revenues in 2012 increased $82 million (3%) over 2011. Revenues from home sales increased $129 million (9%), due primarily to a 14% increase in units sold partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices. Financial services revenues declined $47 million (3%) as a result of lower interest income. Installment loan and finance receivable balances as of December 31, 2012, were approximately $12.3 billion, a decline of approximately $550 million from December 31, 2011. Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings in 2012 increased $101 million (66%) over earnings in 2011. Earnings in 2012 were impacted by the increased unit sales which improved manufacturing and other operating efficiencies. Earnings also benefited from reduced insurance claims and a decline in credit losses. The decline in interest income on loan portfolios was more than offset by interest expense attributable to a decline in borrowings and lower interest rates.  

Revenues of Clayton Homes were $2.9 billion in 2011, a decline of $324 million (10%) from 2010. Revenues from home sales declined approximately 17%, as unit sales declined about 14%. Home sales in 2010 benefitted from the U.S. federal tax credit program offered to homebuyers, which expired on June 30, 2010. In addition, the average price per home sold declined slightly in 2011, as a larger percentage of homes sold were lower priced single section units. Clayton Homes financial services income in 2011 also declined slightly, due primarily to lower interest income from installment loans. Net consumer loan balances at December 31, 2011 declined by approximately $600 million from December 31, 2010 to approximately $12.9 billion. The decline reflects runoff of the loan portfolio and fewer new loans. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $154 million in 2011, a decline of $22 million (12.5%) versus 2010. Earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by lower revenues and a $27 million increase in insurance claims (primarily from severe storms in the spring and summer), partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative and interest expenses.  

While manufactured homes sold were higher in 2012 compared to 2011, Clayton Homes manufactured housing business continues to operate at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions.  

In 2012, revenues of CORT and XTRA increased $14 million (2%), while pre-tax earnings declined $7 million (5%) versus 2011. In 2012, CORTs earnings increased over 2011 due to a 5% increase in rental income and relatively stable selling, general and administrative expenses, which improved operating margins. In 2012, earnings from XTRA declined primarily due to increased depreciation expense and lower foreign currency exchange gains.  

Revenues of CORT and XTRA increased $79 million in 2011 compared to 2010, while earnings increased $102 million. The increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to an increased proportion of assets on lease (utilization rates) and lower depreciation expense. A significant portion of the expenses of our leasing businesses, such as depreciation and facilities expenses, do not change significantly with rental volume, so the impact of revenue changes can have a disproportionate impact on earnings.

Finance and Financial Products (Continued)  

Earnings from our other finance business activities include investment income from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments, a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own 50% and from a small portfolio of long-held commercial real estate loans, which during the third and fourth quarters of 2012 were repaid in full. In addition, other earnings include income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings (approximately $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2012) by a Berkshire financing subsidiary. The borrowings are used to fund loans to Clayton Homes. Corresponding charges for this interest spread (approximately $90 million in 2012, $100 million in 2011 and $110 million in 2010) are reflected in Clayton Homes earnings. In addition, other earnings include guaranty fee income of $30 million in 2012, $41 million in 2011 and $38 million in 2010 from NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in NetJets results.  

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses  

A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders equity since most of our investments are regularly recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  

We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings.  

Pre-tax investment gains from sales and other disposals of investments were approximately $1.3 billion in 2012 and were primarily attributable to sales of equity securities. Investment gains from sales and other disposals in 2011 included an aggregate pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric preferred stock investments. In 2010, investment gains from sales and other disposals were derived principally from dispositions of equity securities and a $1.3 billion gain from the redemption of the Swiss Re capital instrument. Other investment gains in 2010 included a one-time holding gain of $979 million that arose in connection with our acquisition of BNSF as a result of the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

In each of the three years ending December 31, 2012, we recognized OTTI losses on certain of our equity and fixed maturity investments. OTTI losses on fixed maturity investments were $337 million in 2012, $402 million in 2011 and $1,020 million in 2010. In each year, substantially all of the losses related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings (TCEH) bonds. In each year, we recognized losses after reevaluating expected cash flows likely to be received. While we do not currently anticipate further OTTI losses on our TCEH investments, additional losses may be required in the future if the companys financial condition deteriorates further or it pursues bankruptcy reorganization. In 2011 and 2010, we also recognized aggregate OTTI losses of $506 million and $953 million, respectively, related to our investments in equity securities. Such OTTI losses in 2011 and 2010 averaged about 7.5% and 20%, respectively, of the original cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer had been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable. In 2011, a portion of the OTTI losses related to certain components of our Wells Fargo common stock investments.  

Although we have periodically recorded OTTI losses in earnings in each of the past three years, we continue to hold positions in certain of the related securities. In cases where the market values of these investments have increased since the dates the OTTI losses were recorded in earnings, these increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI losses have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  

As of December 31, 2012, unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (determined on an individual purchase lot basis) were $257 million. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline. Security prices may remain below cost for a period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules, even though other factors suggest that the prices will eventually recover. As a result, accounting regulations may require that we recognize OTTI losses in earnings in instances where we may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least our original cost and where we possess the ability and intent to hold the security until, at least, that time.  

Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets. We have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contracts. Under many of the contracts, no settlements will occur until the contract expiration dates, which may occur many years from now.  

In 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains from derivative contracts of approximately $2.0 billion, which included gains from our equity index put option contracts of approximately $1.0 billion. The gains from equity index put option contracts were due to increased index values, foreign currency exchange rate changes and valuation adjustments on a small number of contracts where contractual settlements are determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates. Our recorded liability for these contracts was approximately $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2012.  

In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $1.8 billion on our equity index put option contracts. The losses reflected declines ranging from about 5.5% to 17% with respect to three of the four equity indexes covered under our contracts and lower interest rate assumptions. In 2010, gains on equity index put option contracts were $172 million. In 2010, we settled certain equity index put option contracts early at the request of the counterparty and recorded a gain of $561 million, which is the difference between the recorded fair values of these contracts at the beginning of 2010 and the settlement payment amounts. Otherwise, we recognized pre-tax losses of $389 million under our remaining equity index put option contracts reflecting generally lower interest rate assumptions and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes. There were no new equity contracts entered into or other settlements during the three year period ending December 31, 2012.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

In 2012, we recognized pre-tax gains of $894 million on credit default contracts. Such gains were attributable to narrower spreads and the passage of time (reduced time exposure), as well as from settlements of certain contracts. No new credit default contracts were written during the past three years. A significant portion of our risks related to non-investment grade corporate issuers expired in the fourth quarter of 2012, and all remaining exposures related to corporate issuers expire in 2013.  

We recorded pre-tax losses of $251 million on our credit default contracts in 2011 and gains of $250 million in 2010. The losses in 2011 were primarily related to our contracts involving non-investment grade corporate issuers due to widening credit default spreads and loss events. The gains in 2010 reflected the overall narrowing of credit default spreads for corporate issuers and were somewhat offset by losses due to the widening of spreads for municipalities.  

Financial Condition  

Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2012 was $187.6 billion, an increase of $22.8 billion from December 31, 2011. Consolidated cash and investments of our insurance and other businesses approximated $176.3 billion at December 31, 2012 including cash and cash equivalents of $42.4 billion, of which about $10.6 billion was held by the parent company. Otherwise, invested assets are held predominantly in our insurance businesses. On January 31, 2012, we issued $1.7 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $1.7 billion of notes that matured in February 2012. In January 2013, we issued $2.6 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2043, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $2.6 billion of notes that matured in February 2013.  

In September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase Class A and Class B shares of Berkshire at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors increased the 10% premium limitation to 20%. Berkshire may repurchase shares at managements discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshires consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In December 2012, Berkshire acquired 9,475 Class A shares and 606,499 Class B shares for approximately $1.3 billion.  

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired 10% of the outstanding shares of Marmon held by noncontrolling interests for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 million of the consideration was paid in the fourth quarter, and the remainder is payable in March 2013. As a result of these acquisitions, our ownership interest in Marmon increased to approximately 90%.  

As discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 13, 2013, we committed to invest $12.12 billion in a newly formed holding company that entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire H.J. Heinz Company (Heinz). Our investment will consist of common and preferred stock and we will hold 50% of the voting interests in the holding company. The acquisition of Heinz is subject to approval by Heinz shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013. We expect to use cash on hand to fund our investments.  

Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2012, MidAmericans capital expenditures were $3.4 billion and BNSFs capital expenditures were $3.5 billion. BNSF and MidAmerican forecast aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $8.3 billion in 2013. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2012, BNSF issued debt of $2.5 billion with maturities in 2022 and 2042, and its outstanding debt increased approximately $1.9 billion to $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2012. In 2012, MidAmerican issued or acquired new term debt of approximately $3.1 billion and its aggregate outstanding borrowings increased approximately $1.7 billion to $21.6 billion as of December 31, 2012. BNSF and MidAmerican have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2013 of about $2.5 billion. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2014 to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries.

Financial Condition (Continued)  

Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other fixed maturity and equity investments, were approximately $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $25.0 billion at December 31, 2011. Liabilities were approximately $22.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, notes payable and other borrowings of finance businesses were $13.0 billion and included approximately $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC). In 2012, $2.7 billion of BHFC notes matured. In May and September 2012, BHFC issued $2.35 billion of new notes with maturities in 2017, 2022 and 2042. In 2013, $3.45 billion of BHFC notes will mature, including $500 million that matured in January 2013. BHFC issued new debt of $500 million in January 2013 with maturities in 2017 and 2022. We currently intend to issue additional new debt through BHFC to replace some or all of the upcoming debt maturities. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire.  

We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations.  

We are party to several equity index put option and credit default contracts as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshires credit ratings. Substantially all of these contracts were entered into prior to December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2012, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $7.9 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $40 million.  

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act are subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized in 2013. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.  

Contractual Obligations  

We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.  

The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events that may occur over many years. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premium payments, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and

Critical Accounting Policies  

Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances.  

Property and casualty losses  

A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects.  

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment further contributes to extending claim-tails.  

Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders.  

We utilize processes and techniques to establish liability estimates that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.  

GEICO  

GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2012 were $10.3 billion, which included $7.5 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $2.8 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. Auto insurance claims generally have a relatively short claim-tail. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity).  

Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate.  

Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2012) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (60%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Reserves are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows.  

We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for claims when adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.  

Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised as more information becomes known.  

For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2012, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In  

51

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

GEICO (Continued)  

 general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically.  

For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts in order to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management personnel.  

For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.  

Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimates recorded at the end of 2011 developed downward by $736 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2012, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2012. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 4.4% of earned premiums in 2012 and approximately 7.2% of prior year-end recorded liabilities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2012 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated.  

Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 92% of GEICOs reserves as of December 31, 2012 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (BI) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $154 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.  

GEICOs exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICOs total reserves (approximately 1.5%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant.  

General Re and BHRG  

Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating such reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Contract terms and conditions tend to lack standardization and contract terms, conditions and coverages may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies. We are unable to reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties.  

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when our personnel either works closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manages the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re and BHRG (Continued)  

Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. We periodically evaluate and modify these practices as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified.  

The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurers. In some instances, multiple reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays are compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims until they conclude it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance.  

Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays.  

Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, we are permitted under the contracts to access the cedants books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem appropriate.  

In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re (Continued)  

General Res loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period.  

We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, claim counts or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail.  

Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2012, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.5 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2012, we conducted 270 claim reviews.  

Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business.  

We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.  

We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios.  

We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

General Re (Continued)  

In 2012, our reported claims for prior years workers compensation losses were less than expected by $192 million. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves. These developments precipitated a net increase of $118 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After adjusting for the $142 million net increase in liabilities from changes in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers compensation losses from prior years occurrences reduced pre-tax earnings in 2012 by $68 million. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2012 of approximately $776 million and $411 million on a discounted basis. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed downward in 2012 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $943 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $943 million.  

Overall, our property losses were lower than expected in 2012 as a result of fewer catastrophe losses during the year. Our reported claims for prior years property losses were less than expected by $402 million from December 31, 2011. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses.  

In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $173 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, mass tort liabilities, net of reinsurance, were approximately $1.2 billion. Mass tort net claims paid were $79 million in 2012. In 2012, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $37 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios based on net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2012. The reinsurance industrys survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 8.8 years based on the three years ending December 31, 2011. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG  

BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2012 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change.  

As of December 31, 2012, our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses (relating to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date) above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.6 billion in 2012. The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of case reserves. We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract.  

In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process. In 2012, changes in retroactive reserves related to contracts written in prior years were not significant.  

BHRGs liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $12.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and $12.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. We paid losses in 2012 attributable to these exposures of approximately $862 million. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future.  

The maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies is not expected to exceed approximately $35 billion as of December 31, 2012, which is based on aggregate contract limits applicable to most of the contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that gross unpaid losses as of December 31, 2012 ($18.0 billion) will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

A significant number of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims. These include property losses from catastrophes and aviation risks under catastrophe and individual risk contracts. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2012, a decrease of about $400 million from December 31, 2011. In 2012, changes in estimated losses for prior years events had an insignificant effect on pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Catastrophe loss reserves are provided when it is probable that an insured loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.  

Other reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis, supplemented by managements judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared.  

Derivative contract liabilities  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2012 our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standard. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are based on valuation models that are believed to be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Changes in assumptions may have a significant effect on values.  

We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2012 were 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively, and were approximately 3.3% and 3.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. The interest rates as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately 95 basis points and 153 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe, however, that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and to a lesser degree to the foreign currency component.  

The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 8 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2012 was approximately 20.9%, compared to 21.4% as of December 31, 2011. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2012 ($7.5 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. The values of contracts in an

 actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition, we have exposures relating to a number of credit default contracts written involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. As of December 31, 2012, all credit default contracts involving corporate issuers will expire in 2013. Values associated with these contracts are no longer significant, as the risks of loss are no longer significant. Our states/municipalities exposures begin to expire in 2019. The fair values of our state/municipality issuer credit default contracts are generally based on bond pricing data on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data or inputs obtained.  

Prices in a current market trade involving identical (or sufficiently similar) risks and contract terms as our equity index put option or credit default contracts could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge these contracts. We intend to allow these contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates.  

Other Critical Accounting Policies  

We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Significant changes in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $54.5 billion, which includes $1.4 billion arising from our various acquisitions in 2012. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2012. Such tests include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual future results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings as an impairment loss.  

Market Risk Disclosures  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.

Interest Rate Risk  

We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks.  

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments.  

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Equity Price Risk  

Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and

 prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few investees. At December 31, 2012, approximately 63% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated in five investees.  

We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.  

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.  

We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates.  

The following table summarizes our equity and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with equity price risk as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. The effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates are also shown. The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk  

We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in major multinational companies that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own, such as The Coca-Cola Company. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.  

Commodity Price Risk  

Our diverse group of operating businesses use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at MidAmerican. MidAmericans exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers. The table that follows summarizes our commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of MidAmerican as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Dollars are in millions.
