ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

At September 30, 2008, the Company had borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility of $780 million that was subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility bear interest, at its option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for a one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine or twelve month) interest period chosen by TransDigm Inc., in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the Companys cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under the Senior Secured Credit Facility by approximately $7.8 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2008. The weighted average interest rate on the $780 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility on September 30, 2008 was 5.2%.  

At September 30, 2008, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the Senior Secured Credit Facility for fixed interest rates through June 23, 2009 for the notional amount of $150 million. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2008 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a liability of $2.7 million.  

At September 30, 2008, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our Senior Secured Credit Facility for fixed interest rates through March 23, 2011 for the notional amount of $300 million. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2008, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was an asset of $3.2 million.  

The fair value of the $780 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loan approximated $725 million at September 30, 2008 based upon information provided to the Company from its agent under the credit facility. The fair value of the $575 million aggregate principal amount of the TransDigm Inc.s 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of such notes approximated $529 million at September 30, 2008 based upon the quoted market rates.
