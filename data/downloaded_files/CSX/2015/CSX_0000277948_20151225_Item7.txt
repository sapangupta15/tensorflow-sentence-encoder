Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations with its approximately 29,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. Low natural gas prices, increased foreign labor costs and supply chain factors have helped to improve competitiveness of CSX's customers over the long term. 

The rail industry benefits from this long-term improved global competitiveness, continued economic growth and the shift towards more rail-based solutions. U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise and freight railroads provide the most environmentally efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight about 475 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel, as trains are four times more fuel efficient than trucks on average. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion, eases air pollution and saves energy.

CSX's network reaches nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population, which accounts for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries and population centers across the United States with each other and with global markets through access to over 70 port facilities whereby meeting the transportation needs of energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States Armed Forces.

Operating Initiatives

To support long-term growth, CSX is focused on meeting or exceeding customers’ expectations while improving profitability. Several key operating initiatives have been implemented over the past several years that lay a foundation for meeting these objectives. The overall goal is sustained high customer service levels, which is in part achieved through a relentless focus on using advanced network modeling analytics and tools to create a disciplined, scheduled approach to designing and running CSX's network. The Company continues to identify the most efficient, cost-effective routes for CSXT customers' traffic while providing timely service with the fewest handlings and car miles possible.

Through the Service Excellence initiative, CSX is building a culture that engages all employees and focuses on the value delivered to customers through improved service. This initiative increases employee communication and dialogue to help identify and resolve customer issues at the lowest level, improving the customer experience and allowing CSX to grow the business. This process involves engagement from all operating employees, as well as collaboration with sales and marketing employees and, ultimately, with the Company’s customers. Higher levels of customer service and satisfaction support CSX’s ability to profitably grow the business by increasing customer retention, price sustainability and asset utilization.

In addition, Total Service Integration (“TSI”) is intended to align operating capabilities with customers' needs resulting in an efficient and effective service product. TSI was first implemented in the unit train network, where it successfully increased the average number of cars per train and improved asset utilization. CSX has been implementing TSI in the carload network over the past few years and has focused on improving the “first and last mile” service experience for carload customers, providing a more consistent and reliable service product. The carload network is connected to more than 5,000 customer facilities and has a high degree of variability each day. New tools and technology have allowed the Company to more effectively communicate with customers, not only providing the service the Company has promised to deliver but proactively notifying the customer of service status. Applying TSI to the carload network has improved local customer service satisfaction and local service performance. 

Finally, Enterprise Asset Management (“EAM”) focuses on improving the utilization of the company’s most critical assets, namely, crews, locomotives, cars and track infrastructure. Projects are currently in place to deploy technology, improve processes and reduce unproductive time. Because the railroad is an asset intensive industry, EAM helps reduce the overall expense associated with asset ownership by monitoring the overall condition of equipment, helping proactively schedule maintenance, increasing utilization and also effectively managing the investment required for new or replacement assets. By improving asset utilization, CSX expects to sustain long-term operating efficiencies and reduce future capital expenditures associated with asset replacement.

In summary, these initiatives are designed to improve service levels in a cost effective manner and enhance the reliability of rail transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service are better aligning CSX's operating capabilities with customers' needs and are enabling the Company to capitalize on the strategic opportunities described below.

Strategic Opportunities

Intermodal Growth 

CSX’s intermodal business is a growth opportunity that provides an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX’s intermodal network connects all major population centers east of the Mississippi River, and over 90% of intermodal traffic moves in double-stack (two containers high) service. This positions the Company to capture a significant share of the incremental domestic intermodal market opportunity, estimated at nine million truckloads in the eastern United States that move over 550 miles. The Company’s highway-to-rail initiatives assist in capturing this traffic and also help customers identify conversion opportunities for both domestic moves and the U.S. portion of international moves.

To further enhance the Company's intermodal offering and support future growth, CSX recently completed new or expanded terminal construction to increase network capacity and broaden its market presence in key growth areas. In 2015, CSX began construction on a new terminal near Pittsburgh, PA, enhancing the Company’s reach and supporting continued growth. Over the past several years, the Company also opened or expanded seven other terminals in Winter Haven, FL; Quebec, Canada; Columbus, OH; Louisville, KY; Atlanta, GA; and Worcester, MA; as well as the Company's Northwest Ohio terminal which is part of the National Gateway Initiative discussed below.

Illinois Basin Coal Shift

Energy markets have shifted over the past few years and continue to evolve. For instance, domestic utility coal demand decreased in 2015 relative to previous years. In the long term, downward pressure on domestic coal volumes will likely continue as the result of increasingly stringent existing and proposed environmental regulations and continued low natural gas prices. In addition, mining economics are causing a shift from Central Appalachian coal to thermal coal in the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin. CSX will capitalize on these shifts and address structural costs in the regions of declining volume.

 21

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Export Coal

CSX export coal volume and pricing is subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy, competition from foreign coal producers and regulatory shifts. Over the past few years, CSX has capitalized on the global coal demand in both steel manufacturing and power generation. Currently, both global thermal and metallurgical coal prices are low due to oversupply, but CSX sees long-term growth in global demand as developing countries become more urbanized. The Company remains opportunistic based on the global markets and the resulting level of demand. 

Energy Markets 

Shale drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas has created the opportunity for CSX to serve energy markets such as crude oil, liquefied petroleum gases (“LPG”), frac sand and other related materials, although energy market volume is volatile from year to year. For example, CSX is capitalizing on the opportunity to move the supply of crude oil from the domestic oil fields, particularly those located in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, to customers at eastern refineries. This service also provides greater flexibility in source locations as compared to pipelines. Volume, however, may vary depending upon oil prices and spreads. 

CSX’s LPG market is also benefiting from drilling in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia within the Utica shale region. Midstream energy companies, which are involved in the transportation, storage and wholesale of refined petroleum products, are taking advantage of the abundance of inexpensive wet gas with newly constructed gas processing plants (or “fractionators”) in the region. Rail will also play a vital role in moving LPG products from the fractionators to the market.

Over the longer term, the energy supply outlook for the U.S. will create a sustainable competitive advantage for domestic chemical producers and generate additional growth opportunities for rail. Since natural gas is the primary component in the production of a wide range of petrochemicals, the supply growth and the resulting lower prices have now placed the U.S. amongst the lowest cost production regions in the world. This increased competitiveness is sparking significant investment in new U.S. chemical industry capacity for the first time in more than a decade. CSX is well-positioned to participate in this growing chemical business over the next several years.

Public-Private Partnerships

Expanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are jointly working to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. 

As part of the National Gateway project, CSX broke ground on the modernization of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. in 2015.This project will improve the flow of freight traffic through the District of Columbia and will eliminate a rail-traffic bottleneck that also impacts commuter and passenger trains in the region. The new structure will provide double-stack train clearances in Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Going forward, CSX will continue to explore other opportunities to partner with the public sector to maximize the many public benefits of freight rail.

Balanced Approach to Cash Deployment 

CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2015, the Company invested $2.6 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During 2015, the Company announced a 13 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per common share. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 13 times over the last ten years which represents a 26 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also in 2015, CSX announced a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by April 2017 based on market and business decisions. CSX repurchased $804 million, or 26 million shares, during 2015 under this program. Since 2006, CSX has repurchased 520 million shares (adjusted for stock splits) for $9.6 billion, which represents about one-half of total shares currently outstanding. As part of this balanced approach, the Company is committed to maintaining a credit profile consistent with a BBB+ rating by Standard & Poor’s and a Baa1 rating by Moody’s Investment Services.

Summary

These operating initiatives, strategic areas, long-term investments and shareholder returns discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth, productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $73 million year over year to $992 million. The primary reason for the increase in free cash flow from the prior year is primarily due to the following:

•Higher proceeds from a property sale and other related income of $85 million

•Higher net sales of long-term marketable securities of $71 million

•Partially offsetting these increases were higher property additions of $113 million

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

PART II

Revenue

In 2015, Revenue decreased $858 million, or 7%, mostly due to the decline in fuel surcharge of $646 million. Additionally, the decline in volume of 2% and unfavorable mix were partially offset by pricing strength.

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products - Volume declined due to challenging world market conditions and a strong U.S. dollar. Specifically, high levels of imported ethanol reduced rail moves to Eastern markets and export grain was down significantly. These declines were partially offset by strength in feed grain and domestic soybean moves, reflecting the record 2014-2015 harvest. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume was down, reflecting weak demand for fertilizers driven by oversupply, low corn prices and a challenged export market due to strength of the U.S. dollar.

Food and Consumer - Volume declined as excess truck capacity and poor Western crop yields in produce led to lower shipments of fresh foods.

Industrial

Chemicals - Volume was flat as strong gains in LPG and petroleum products were offset by a slowdown in crude oil and frac sand due to low oil prices.

Automotive - Volume increased as gains in auto movement, especially SUVs and trucks, resulted from strong North American light vehicle production and consumer demand.

Metals - Volume declined due to high levels of steel imports which resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar and led to lower production of domestic steel.

Housing and Construction

Forest Products - Volume declines reflect high inventories of building products in the housing sector as well as declining demand due to electronic substitution in paper products.

Minerals - Volume growth reflects strength in aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) due to increased highway and non-residential construction activity.

Waste and Equipment - Volume was down as a result of the conclusion of major remediation projects and reduced military vehicle movement partially offset by increases in municipal waste.

Coal

Domestic - Volume declined as a result of mild weather, high stockpiles and low natural gas prices favoring natural gas power generation.

Export - Reductions in both metallurgical and thermal coal volume resulted from ongoing weak market conditions due to global oversupply and the strength of the U.S. dollar.

Intermodal

Domestic - Domestic volume increased 12% due to customer growth, continued success with CSX’s highway-to-rail conversion program and new service offerings. 

International - Competitive losses resulted in a 5% international volume decline during a volatile year marked by West Coast port disruption, a subsequent volume surge and then a weak peak season.

Other 

Other revenue increased $56 million as a result of higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes as well as higher incidental revenue.

Expense

In 2015, total expenses decreased $829 million, or 9%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $87 million primarily due to the following items:

•Inflation resulted in $128 million of additional cost driven by increased wages partially offset by reduced health and welfare costs.

•Incentive compensation was $97 million lower reflecting reduced award payouts on existing plans.

•Efficiency savings of $84 million were primarily a result of reduced crew starts due to the Company's train length initiatives, lower operating support costs and reduced management headcount.

•Volume-related costs were $66 million lower.

•Restructuring costs were $2 million higher versus prior year. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “Workforce Reduction Plans, Separation and Other Costs.”

•Various other costs increased $30 million.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal services at automotive facilities and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $148 million primarily driven by the following:

•Efficiency savings of $91 million were driven by a reduction in professional costs as well as lower operating support costs.

•Volume-related costs were $52 million lower.

•Real estate gains were $23 million higher primarily related to the sale of operating rail corridor.

•Inflation resulted in $47 million of additional costs.

•Various other costs decreased $29 million.

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $659 million driven by the following:

•Average fuel price per gallon decreased 39%, from $1.15 to $1.80 per gallon, versus the prior year which reduced expenses by $560 million.

•Volume-related costs were $66 million lower.

•Other fuel savings of $33 million were primarily due to lower non-locomotive fuel price. 

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $57 million primarily due to a larger asset base.

PART II

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $8 million driven by the following:

•Inflation resulted in $16 million of additional cost related to rates on automotive and intermodal cars.

•Efficiency savings of $15 million were due to improved car cycle times.

•Net other costs increased $7 million.

Interest expense decreased $1 million to $544 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.

Other income (expense) - net increased $122 million to $98 million primarily due to a $59 million gain on a sale of non-operating easements and a reimbursement of environmental costs of $21 million related to this sale. Additionally, 2015 environmental costs were $21 million lower than 2014, and prior year costs of $16 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt did not repeat in the current year.

Income tax expense increased $53 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to higher earnings as well as prior year favorable state legislative changes that did not repeat in the current year.

Net earnings increased $41 million to $2.0 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.08 to $2.00 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding resulting from higher share repurchase activity also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.

PART II

Revenue

In 2014, volume increased 6% year over year with growth across most markets. Revenue increased by 5% year over year driven by this broad-based volume growth.

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of grain and ethanol. A combined record corn and soybean crop in 2013 led to higher grain shipments and reduced U.S. corn prices resulting in increased ethanol production in 2014.

Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of finished fertilizer products to replenish inventories and phosphate rock shipments due to capacity at a customer facility returning to normal levels.

Food and Consumer - Volume declined due to lower shipments of canned goods and rice. The decline in canned goods was driven by market losses, while rice shipments were lower as customers substituted lower-priced corn. This decline was partially offset by growth in alcoholic beverage shipments due to a customer’s gain in market share.

Industrial

Chemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, LPG and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments to East Coast refineries was due to increased supply of low-cost crude oil from shale drilling activity.

Automotive - Volume increased as North American light vehicle production grew, but rail equipment shortages due to network performance in early 2014 tempered this growth.

Metals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in sheet steel shipments due to growth in automotive production and market gains.

Housing and Construction

Forest Products -Volume increased due to increased shipments of building products and pulpboard. Building products was driven by the continued recovery in the residential housing market. Pulpboard shipments increased due to modal conversions and inventory replenishments that resulted from reduced production late last year.

Minerals - Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) and salt. Aggregates was driven by the continued recovery in construction activity, while salt shipments grew due to increased application of road salt and inventory replenishment as a result of the severe winter weather in early 2014.

Waste and Equipment - Volume increased due to growth in machinery shipments of wind energy components and municipal solid waste shipments from a new service offering to a customer location. This growth was partially offset by lower industrial waste shipments due to the completion of one-time remediation projects.

Coal

Domestic volume increased due to higher shipments attributable to higher natural gas prices, marketplace gains and utilities replenishing stockpiles. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in export coal as a result of softening global market conditions.

 31

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Intermodal

Domestic volume increased as a result of growth with existing customers and continued success with highway-to-rail conversions. International volume also increased due to growth with customers in global container shipments moving to inland destinations.

Other 

Other revenue increased primarily due to higher incidental revenue associated with higher volume partially offset by decline in revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes.

Expense

In 2014, total expenses increased $503 million, or 6%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $239 million primarily due to the following items:

•Volume-related costs were $71 million higher primarily due to increased workforce levels to capture strong customer demand. 

•Inflation was $67 million higher.

•Labor costs were $49 million higher due to overtime and relief crews associated with weather disruptions earlier in the year and efforts to improve network performance.

•An initial charge for $39 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of an initiative to reduce the management workforce. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, “Workforce Reduction Plans, Separation and Other Costs.”

•Labor costs were $30 million higher due to an amended locomotive maintenance service agreement where CSX now provides oversight of the labor force. Outside service costs shifted from materials, supplies and other to labor and fringe. Overall expense is neutral for the year. 

•Other costs were $17 million lower primarily due to reduced pension costs and incentive compensation costs that reflect lower award payments.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal services at automotive facilities and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expenses increased$209 million primarily driven by the following:

•Prior year real estate gains were $85 million. No gains were recognized in the current year.

•Volume-related costs rose $58 million primarily due to increased resource levels in response to the 6% volume growth to help capture strong customer demand.

•Utilities, materials and foreign locomotive costs were $44 million higher in response to weather-related service challenges earlier in the year and efforts to improve network performance.

•Inflation was $39 million higher.

•Risk-related costs increased by $13 million due to higher derailments earlier in the year, which reflect the increase in the FRA train accident frequency rate.

•Partially offsetting these increases was the amended locomotive maintenance agreement which shifted $30 million to labor and fringe as referenced above.

 32

This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $47 million primarily due to a larger asset base.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $48 million driven by the following:

•Car hire costs were $31 million higher due to volume, longer car cycle times and network performance.

•Inflation resulted in $18 million of additional costs related to rates on automotive, intermodal and coal cars.

•Other costs improved $1 million.

Interest expense decreased $17 million to $545 million primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average debt balances.

Other (expense) income - net decreased $35 million to an expense of $24 million primarily due to an increase in estimated environmental costs of $17 million related to non-operating activities as well as costs of $16 million associated with the early redemption of long-term debt.

Income tax expense increased $59 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings partially offset by favorable state legislative changes.

Net earnings increased $63 million to $1.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.09 to $1.92 due to the factors mentioned above. Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.

Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. CSX safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can impact employees, customers and the communities we serve.

The Company constantly collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on safety innovations and initiatives. For example, CSX and other freight railroads have actively worked with the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") and other key stakeholders to evaluate and implement far-reaching safety enhancements for transportation of certain flammable materials, including essential energy products, on the nation’s freight railroad network. 

At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to maintaining a constant focus on safety. CSX remains the industry leader with the lowest personal injury across Class I railroads this year. The FRA reportable personal injury frequency index improved 9 percent year over year to 0.89. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate weakened 2 percent year over year to 2.45.

The Company made strong improvements to network reliability and service measures in 2015 while continuing to drive productivity and resource efficiency. On-time originations improved 20 percent year over year to 67 percent, and on-time arrivals increased 13 percent year over year to 51 percent. Average train velocity and terminal dwell both improved 2 percent year over year to 20.5 miles per hour and 25.8 hours, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows

Consolidated Balance Sheets

CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.

Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $2.0 billion from prior year. The increase in assets was driven by higher net properties of $1.6 billion resulting from capital investments as well as higher short-term investments of $518 million. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by net earnings of $1.9 billion and new debt of $1.5 billion (which includes about $300 million of deferred seller financing). Partially offsetting these increases were dividends paid of $686 million and share repurchases of $804 million.

Significant cash flows

The following tables present net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sources of Cash

The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2015, the Company generated $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities which was $27 million higher than prior year primarily driven by higher collections of freight accounts receivable. In 2014, the Company generated $3.3 billion of cash from operating activities which was $76 million higher than 2013 primarily driven by higher net earnings. 

Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2020. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.

Third, CSX filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2013 which the Company expects to renew in February 2016. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.

PART II

Uses of Cash

CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion, an increase in net investing of $709 million from the prior year primarily driven by fewer net sales of short-term investments. In 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion, a decrease in spending of $44 million from 2013 primarily driven by higher net sales of short-term investments. 

 The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Total capital expenditures shown above include investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships. These partnership investments are for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 

Planned capital investments for 2016 are expected to be $2.4 billion, including approximately $300 million for PTC. This $2.4 billion excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in the year the reimbursement obligation arises. Approximately half of the 2016 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return projects supporting long-term profitable growth, productivity initiatives and service improvements. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.

Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.2 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2015 was $1.5 billion. 

In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $519 million, which represents a decrease in spending of $564 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher net long-term debt issued of $904 million (net of lower debt repayments) partially offset by higher share repurchases of $287 million. In 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, which represents a decrease in spending of $149 million from 2013. This decrease was driven by higher net long-term debt issued of $347 million (net of debt repayments) partially offset by share repurchases of $164 million.

PART II

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 

Liquidity and Working Capital

Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in May 2020 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2015, CSX issued a total of $1.2 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, working capital requirements and improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. 

The Company has a receivables securitization facility with a three-year term expiring in June 2017. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity of up to $250 million. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.

Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $1 billion and $465 million at December 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase since the prior year end is primarily due to the net proceeds from a debt issuance partially offset by debt repayments. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings

 Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

 37

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2015. As of December 2014 and December 2015, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:

•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;

•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;

•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and

•income taxes. 

Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves

 Casualty

Casualty reserves of $265 million and $269 million for 2014 and 2015, respectively, represent accruals for personal injury, asbestos and occupational injury claims. The Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims is $50 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust casualty reserves.

Personal Injury

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to FELA. In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other current or former CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.

CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.

Asbestos & Occupational

The Company is party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The greatest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.

 39

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Management reviews asserted asbestos claims quarterly. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, unasserted or incurred but not reported ("IBNR") asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party specialist and reviewed by management annually. In 2014, management extended the forecast period from seven years to ten years. Based on a review of historical settlement trends, management concluded that ten years is the most probable time period in which unasserted asbestos claim filings and claim values can be estimated. The Company does not believe there is sufficient data to justify a projection period longer than ten years at this time. The change in the forecast period resulted in an immaterial increase in the asbestos reserves during 2014. Approximately 20% of the recorded undiscounted liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 80% is related to unasserted claims as of December 25, 2015.

CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates are analyzed to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSXT’s employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the specialist estimates the IBNR claims liabilities.

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims.

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.

Environmental

 Environmental reserves were $94 million and $82 million for 2014 and 2015, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 242 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:

•type of clean-up required;

•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);

•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and

•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

 Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the cost of remedial actions currently required.

Legal

In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.  As of December 2015, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans were $3 billion and $314 million, respectively. No significant contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans are expected in 2016.

 41

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Eligible retirees who are age 65 years or older (Medicare-eligible) are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Eligible retirees younger than 65 years (non-Medicare eligible) are covered by a self-insured program partially funded by participating retirees. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:

•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;

•long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•salary scale inflation rates; and

•other assumptions.

The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. These amounts are reviewed by management.

Discount Rates

 Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2015 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.30% and 3.85%, respectively. For 2014, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 4.00% and 3.60%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2015, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

 42

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

 The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.00% and 7.25% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Salary Scale Inflation Rates

 Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60% and 4.10% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to value its pension obligations.

Other Assumptions

The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management.

2016 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense

Net pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $58 million and $16 million, respectively, compared to $69 million and $17 million, respectively, in 2015. The decrease in expense is largely related to the impact of higher discount rates and historically favorable pension asset experience.

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2015 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method

The Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $42 billion on a gross basis at December 2015. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.

 43

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.

The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.

Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets generally every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets generally every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. In 2014, the Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. The Company plans to complete the next depreciation study for road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2016.

Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.

There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:

•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;

•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;

•evaluation of current operations;

•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;

•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;

•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;

•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and

•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

 44

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. This practice is consistent with accounting treatment normally prescribed under the group-life method. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.

In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).

Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $11 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. 

Income Taxes

CSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2014. During 2015, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2015. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2015, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $23 million.
