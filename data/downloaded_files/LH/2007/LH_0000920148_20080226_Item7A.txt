Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   

 The Company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. Although, as set forth below, the Companys zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the Companys financial position or results of operations.   

 The Companys zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133 Accouting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:   

 1)     The Company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after September 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period.    

 2)     Holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by Standard & Poors Ratings Services is BB- or lower.    

 The Company believes these embedded derivatives had no fair value at December 31, 2007.   

 Borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements.   

 Two of the Companys joint venture partnerships operate in Canada and remit the Companys share of partnership income in Canadian Dollars. Accordingly, the cash flow received from these affiliates is subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange risk.
