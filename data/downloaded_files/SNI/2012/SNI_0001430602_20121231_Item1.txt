ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

SEPARATION FROM THE E. W. SCRIPPS COMPANY  

Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. was formed on July 1, 2008 and became a publicly traded company as the result of the separation of The E. W. Scripps Company (our Former Parent or E. W. Scripps) into two publicly traded companies. The separation was completed through a tax free distribution of Scripps Networks Interactive shares to E. W. Scripps shareholders following the close of business on June 30, 2008.  

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  

Scripps Networks Interactive is one of the leading developers of lifestyle-oriented content for television and the Internet with respected, high-profile television and interactive brands. Our businesses engage audiences and efficiently serve advertisers by delivering entertaining and highly useful content that focuses on specifically defined topics of interest.  

We manage our operations through our reportable operating segment, Lifestyle Media. Lifestyle Media includes our national television networks, Food Network, Home and Garden Television (HGTV), Travel Channel, DIY Network (DIY), Cooking Channel and Great American Country (GAC). Lifestyle Media also includes websites that are associated with the aforementioned television brands and other Internet-based businesses serving food, home and travel related categories.  

We also have established lifestyle media brands internationally. Our lifestyle-oriented channels are available in the United Kingdom, other European markets, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. The results for our international businesses are not separately identified as a reportable segment and are included within our corporate and other segment caption.  

Our businesses earn revenue principally from advertising sales, affiliate fees and ancillary sales, including the sale and licensing of consumer products. Programming expenses, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are our primary operating costs.  

We seek to engage audiences that are highly desirable to advertisers with entertaining and informative lifestyle content that is produced for television, the Internet and any other media platforms consumers choose. We intend to expand and enhance our lifestyle brands through the creation of popular new programming and content, the use of new distribution platforms, such as mobile phones and video-on-demand, the licensing and sale of branded consumer products and through international expansion.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS  

Lifestyle Media  

Our Lifestyle Media business segment includes six national television networks and our portfolio of related interactive lifestyle brands. Five of the networks are available in high-definition; HGTV-HD, Food Network-HD, Travel Channel-HD, DIY Network-HD and Cooking Channel-HD. The segment generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising time on national television networks and interactive media platforms and from affiliate fees paid by cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite services and other distributors that carry our network programming. In 2012, revenues from advertising sales and affiliate fees were approximately 69 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total revenue for the Lifestyle Media segment. Our Lifestyle Media segment also earns revenue from the licensing of its content to third parties and the licensing of its brands for consumer products such as videos, books, kitchenware and tools.  

The advertising revenue generated by our national television networks depends on the viewership ratings as determined by Nielsen Media Research and other third-party research companies and the advertising rates paid by advertisers for the company to deliver advertisements to certain viewer demographics. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. HGTV, Food Network, and Cooking Channel and their targeted home and food programming categories appeal strongly to women viewers with higher incomes in the 18 to 49 age range and 25 to 54 age range, audience demographics that are traditionally valued by advertisers. Travel Channel and its targeted travel-based programming appeal to viewers who are more affluent than the average cable viewer and skews slightly toward adult men in the 18 to 49 age range. GAC appeals to women viewers, while DIY Network typically has a higher percentage of adult male viewers. Advertising revenue can fluctuate relative to the popularity of specific programs, blocks of programming during defined periods of the day and seasonal demand of advertisers.  

Affiliate fee revenues are negotiated with individual cable television and direct-to-home satellite operators and other distributors. The negotiations typically result in multi-year carriage agreements with scheduled rate increases. As an incentive to obtain long-term distribution agreements for our networks, we have made cash payments to cable and direct-to-home satellite operators, provided an initial period during which a distributors affiliate fee payments are waived, or both. The amount of the fee we receive is determined by the number of subscribers with access to our network programming.  

Programming expense, employee costs, and sales and marketing expenses are the primary operating costs of our Lifestyle Media segment. Program amortization represented 43 percent of Lifestyle Media expenses in 2012 reflecting our continued investment in the improved quality and variety of programming on our networks. We incur sales and marketing expenses to support brand-building initiatives at all of our television networks.  

The Companys lifestyle-oriented interactive businesses are focused on the internal development and acquisition of interactive media brands that are intended to diversify sources of revenue and enhance our competitive advantage as a leading provider of food, home, travel and lifestyle content. Revenue generated by our lifestyle interactive businesses is derived primarily from the sale of display, banner, rich media and video advertising.  

The lifestyle-oriented interactive businesses consist of multiple websites, including our six network-branded websites, FoodNetwork.com, HGTV.com, TravelChannel.com, DIYNetwork.com, CookingChanneltv.com and GACTV.com. In addition to serving as the home websites for the segments television programming networks, the websites provide informational and instructional content on specific topics within their broader lifestyle content categories. Features such as HGTV KitchenDesign, HGTV BathDesign, and DIY Network Home Improvement are intended to aggregate engaged audiences with interests in specific lifestyle topics. All of the segments interactive businesses benefit from archived television network programming of which approximately 95 percent is owned by the Company. Our ownership of programming enables us to efficiently and economically repurpose it for use on the Internet and other interactive distribution channels, including mobile and video-on-demand.  

The lifestyle websites also consist of other digital services including HGTVRemodels.com (formerly HGTVPro.com), which appeals to construction professionals and advanced do-it-yourself enthusiasts; Food.com (formerly Recipezaar.com), a recipe-sharing social networking website; FrontDoor.com, a local real estate search and consumer information site that features millions of home listings and thousands of videos. The lifestyle websites accounted for about 5 percent of the segments total revenue in 2012. The strategic focus of the lifestyle interactive businesses is to grow advertising revenues by increasing the number of page views and video plays and attracting more unique visitors to our websites through site enhancements and adding more video. Our strategy also includes attracting a broader audience through the placement of our video programming on national video streaming sites and developing new sources of revenue that capitalize on traffic growth at our websites.  

We also have a 7.25 percent ownership interest in Fox-BRV Southern Sports Holdings LLC, which comprises the Sports South and Fox Sports Net South regional television networks, and 50 percent ownership interests in Food Network Magazine JV and HGTV Magazine JV.
