Item 1. Business

General

Rockwell Automation, Inc. ("Rockwell Automation" or "the Company"), a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable. Our products, solutions and services are designed to meet our customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce enterprise business risk.

The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985. 

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928.

Our Control Products & Solutions operating segment recorded sales of $3.24 billion (55 percent of our total sales) in 2016.

Our Architecture & Software operating segment is headquartered in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, and our Control Products & Solutions operating segment is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Both operating segments share a common sales organization and supply chain and conduct business globally. Major markets served by both segments consist of consumer industries, including food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences; transportation, including automotive and tire; and heavy industries, including oil and gas, mining and metals.

Additional information with respect to our operating segments, including a description of our operating segments and their contributions to sales and operating earnings for each of the three years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is contained in Note 15 in the Financial Statements and under the caption Results of Operations in MD&A.

Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our operations outside the United States. Sales and property information by major geographic area for each of the past three years is contained in Note 15 in the Financial Statements.

Competition

Our competitors range from large diversified corporations that also have business interests outside of industrial automation to smaller companies that specialize in niche industrial automation products, solutions and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology differentiation, domain expertise, installed base, distribution network, quality of products, solutions and services, global presence and price. Major competitors of both segments include Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Schneider Electric SA, Emerson Electric Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Honeywell International Inc.

Distribution

In most countries, we sell primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. In other countries, we sell through a combination of our direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through independent distributors. Approximately 70 percent of our global sales are through independent distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 10 percent of our total sales.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our products and operations. While in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition. Various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification have been made to us. We believe that none of these claims or requests will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property.
