Item 1. Business.

Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the "Company," "P&G," "we," "our" or "us" as used herein refer to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.

The Procter & Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories.

Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com.

Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting Wells Fargo, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.

Financial Information about Segments

As of June 30, 2016 the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar. Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming), are seasonal. 

Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Narrative Description of Business

Business Model. Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries 

and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We utilize our superior marketing and online presence to win with consumers at the "zero moment of truth" - when they are searching for information about a brand or product. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the "first moment of truth" - when a consumer is shopping in the store. We must also win the "second moment of truth" - when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and decides whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. 

Key Product Categories. Information on key product categories can be found in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key Customers. Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 35% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete.

Sources and Availability of Materials. Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of which are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the transportation of input materials and of finished product to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole.

Trademarks and Patents. We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. 

2 The Procter & Gamble Company

In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.

Competitive Condition. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors.

Research and Development Expenditures. Research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. Research and development expenses were $1.9 billion in 2016, $2.0 billion in 2015 and $1.9 billion in 2014 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations).

Expenditures for Environmental Compliance. Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2017.

Employees. Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops and employees of joint ventures as of the years ended June 30. The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees. A discussion of progress on non-manufacturing enrollment objectives is included in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The number of employees includes employees of discontinued operations.
