Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Torchmark’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

How Torchmark Views Its Operations: Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life, and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment. 

Insurance Product Line Segments. As fully explained in Note 14—Business Segments, the insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and the administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:

Premium revenue

Less:

Policy obligations

Policy acquisition costs and commissions

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:

Net investment income

Less:

Required interest on net policy liabilities

Financing costs

The tables in Note 14—Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements reconcile Torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017.

Current Year Highlights: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Total premium increased by 5% over the prior year. Life premium also increased by 5% for the year from $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Life underwriting margin also increased 5% from $574 million in 2016 to $604 million in 2017. 

•Net investment income increased 5% over the prior year. In addition, excess investment income, a measure used by management as explained below, increased by 7% over the prior year.

•During 2017, the Company repurchased 4.1 million shares at a total cost of $325 million for an average share price of $78.67. 

The following represents net income and net operating income from continuing operations for the 3 years ended December 31, 2017.

(1)As further discussed below regarding Tax Legislation, excluding the tax reform adjustment, net income as a ROE and net operating income as a ROE would have been 11.7% and 14.4%, respectively. In 2017, the Company recorded a one-time adjustment of $874 million impacting net income. As the impact of the Tax Legislation was treated as a non-operating event, it was excluded from net operating income.

Net income as a ROE and net operating income as a ROE, excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio in 2016 were 12.0% and 14.6%, respectively and 11.9% and 14.5%, respectively in 2015. Net operating income as a ROE, excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of the unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available-for-sale portfolio.

Summary of Operations: Net income was $1.5 billion in 2017, compared with $550 million in 2016. This sharp increase was due to an $874 million increase to net income, primarily relating to a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Legislation). See further discussion below. Net income also increased in 2016 from $527 million in 2015. On a diluted per common share basis, 2017 net income rose 

17

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
172% to $12.22 after an 8% increase in 2016, again largely related to implementation of the Tax Legislation. Without the impact of the Tax Legislation, net income per diluted common share would have been $4.88. Net income per diluted common share in 2016 rose to $4.49 from $4.16 in 2015. The per share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. Each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains (losses), which were $0.15, $(0.06), and $(0.05), in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. More information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report. 

Net operating income from continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from $523 million in 2015 to $549 million in 2016 to $574 million in 2017. Net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a non-GAAP measure. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. See Note 14—Business Segments for a discussion of the usefulness and purpose of this measure. We do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, net income was affected by certain significant and unusual non-operating items in each of the years 2015 through 2017. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. We remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Legislation was enacted which changed existing tax law, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company recorded $877 million of tax benefits in net income as a result of re-measuring its deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate as of the date of enactment. Based on the analysis of the Tax Legislation, the Company was able to determine that this amount is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Legislation in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. However, the Company will continue to analyze relevant information to complete the accounting for income taxes which may result in an adjustment to income tax expense in 2018. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax returns are filed later in 2018. In addition, the Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, and recorded a $252 million reclassification from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to Retained Earnings to eliminate the stranded tax effects associated with the tax rate change, primarily relating to the unrealized gains and losses on the available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio. More information concerning income taxes is provided in Note 8—Income Taxes.

There will be substantial long-term benefits from the Tax Legislation due to the taxation of future profits at the new 21% tax rate. Looking forward, we are anticipating the effective tax rate on our net operating income before stock compensation expense to decrease and be in the range of 19% to 20%. Despite the lower expected tax rate for financial reporting purposes, in the short and intermediate term, we do not anticipate a significant reduction in our current tax expense, as benefits of the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by several provisions included in the Tax Legislation that increase the Company's current taxable income.

The below table illustrates the impact of the tax reform adjustment on certain balances.

Analysis of Profitability by Segment

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented. This segment contributed $31 million in 2017 and $4 million in 2016 to the growth in our underwriting margin. Also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment, which provided $9 million of additional margin in 2017 and $6 million in 2016. 

Excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, increased 7% to $239 million from the prior year amount of $224 million. In 2016, excess investment income increased 2%. Investment yields continue to be pressured by investing at yields lower than the yield on dispositions and the average yield on the portfolio. 

Total revenues rose 6% in 2017 to $4.2 billion, or $221 million over the prior year total of $3.9 billion. Life premium rose 5% or $117 million in 2017 to $2.3 billion. Life premium increased $116 million in 2016 to $2.2 billion. Net investment income rose $41 million or 5% in 2017, and rose 4% or $33 million in 2016. Health premium increased 3% to $976 million in 2017 and contributed $29 million to 2017 revenue growth, after having gained 2% to $948 million in 2016. Health premium contributed $22 million to 2016 revenue growth.

Life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown in each of the last three years ended December 31, 2017. The increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency. While premium and underwriting margins grew, margin as a percent of premium remained flat in 2017 at 26%, after decreasing from 27% to 26% from 2015 to 2016. Net life sales increased in 2017 to $416 million. Net life sales were flat between 2015 and 2016. The life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption Life Insurance.

Health insurance premium income increased 3% to $976 million in 2017. Health net sales rose 9% to $158 million during 2017 due to both individual and group sales. Group sales vary significantly from period to period due to the 

19

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
impact of large groups that are sold from time-to-time. First-year collected health premium fell 3% to $136 million from the prior year total of $140 million as a result of higher net sales in Medicare Supplement in the fourth quarter of 2015 that positively affected the 2016 first-year collected premium. Health margins as a percentage of premium were flat at 22%, with underwriting income increasing to $220 million for 2017 due to the growth in premium income. Underwriting income was $210 million in 2016 compared with $204 million in 2015. The health insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption Health Insurance.

We do not currently market annuities. See the caption Annuities for discussion of the Annuity segment.

Excess investment income, is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In 2017, net investment income rose 5%, compared with 4% in 2016. At the same time, our investment portfolio grew 6% in 2017 and 2016, on an amortized cost basis. In recent years, the percentage growth in net investment income has been less than the growth in the overall investment portfolio due primarily to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates on dispositions and the average yield on the portfolio. The growth rate of net investment income is impacted at times by a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, during which the funds are held in cash. In addition, Torchmark’s share repurchase program (described later under this caption) has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments and increase net investment income. The growth in the investment portfolio has been augmented in 2017 and 2016 due to the receipt of certain receivables that had accumulated under our Medicare Part D business. 

The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. The lower new-money yields resulting from the low interest rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. Financing costs in 2017 increased 1% to $85 million from $83 million in 2016. The additional interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in the cost of our short-term borrowings and, in lesser part, from the issuance of our new 5.275% Junior Subordinated Debt security thirty-six days before the repayment of our 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debt security.

Insurance administrative expenses were up 7.1% in 2017 when compared with the prior year period, and increased to 6.4% as a percentage of premium from 6.3% in 2016 and 6.2% in 2015. The increase in administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in other employee costs and investments in information technology. Corporate and Other expenses were up primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, reflecting Torchmark's higher share price as compared with the same period a year ago, and recognition of a one-time increase in stock-based compensation expense due to the Tax Legislation.

Share Purchases

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the Parent Company, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow. Excess cash flow at the Parent Company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt, dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders, and other limited operating activities. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years.

(Amounts in thousands)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow at the Parent Company.

A discussion of each of Torchmark’s segments follows. The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in Note 14—Business Segments.

Life Insurance 

Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2017 life premium representing 70% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72% of the total in 2017. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: “annualized premium in force,” “net sales,” and “first-year collected premium.” 

•Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. 

•Net sales is annualized premium issued (Gross premium that would be received during the policies' first year in force and assuming that none of the policies lapsed or terminated.), net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Globe Life Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a better indicator of the rate of premium growth as compared to annualized premium issued. 

•First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.

The American Income Exclusive Agency has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions. While labor unions are still the core market for this agency, American Income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups, third party internet vendor leads, and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth. This agency is Torchmark’s largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 43% of Torchmark’s 2017 total. This group produced premium income of $999 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year total of $913 million, after having risen 10% in 2016. First-year collected premium was $183 million compared to $174 million in 2016, an increase of 5%. First-year collected premium rose 11% in 2016. Net sales increased 6% to $223 million in 2017 over the 2016 total of $210 million. Net sales increased 6% in 2016 over the 2015 total of $198 million. Sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force. The American Income Agency's average agent count rose 4% to 6,962 in 2017. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period. 

The American Income Exclusive Agency continues to focus on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force. To accomplish this, the agency places an emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train its agents, including more home-office and webinar training programs. These programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level managers, coaching and instruction specifically designed for their level of experience and responsibility. We have made considerable investments in information technology in support of the agency, including the launching of a lead mapping and management tool to the agency force. We anticipate this tool will help the Agency enhance agent productivity and agent retention.

The Globe Life Direct Response unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. These different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer. The Globe Life Direct Response 

23

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
channel’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation. In recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center. We continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates.

While the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a Globe Life Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time.

Globe Life Direct Response’s life premium income rose 4% to $813 million, representing 35% of Torchmark’s total life premium during 2017. Life premium in this channel increased 5% in 2016 to $783 million over the 2015 total of $747 million. Net sales of $136 million for this group decreased 10% from $150 million in 2016, after a 9% decrease in 2016 due to operational changes designed to maximize underwriting margin dollars. We expect sales to decline, consistent with this recent trend, through 2018. First-year collected premium decreased 7% to $92 million in 2017 after having decreased 7% in 2016.

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency markets individual and group life insurance to middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was $275 million in 2017, an increase of 2% from $270 million in 2016. Life premium income in 2015 totaled $271 million. Net sales increased 17% during 2017 to $47 million over the 2016 total of $40 million. Net sales in 2016 increased 12%. The continued increases in net sales reflect changes in structure of the agency that were put in place several years ago. Middle management has also grown within the agency which will help continue this growth. First-year collected premium increased 14% to $33 million during 2017 and increased 6% in 2016 to $29 million.

The Liberty average producing agent count increased from 1,715 in 2016 to 2,017 in 2017. We continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from small-town markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long term agency growth. Additionally, the agency's prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business.

The Other Agencies distribution channels offering life insurance include the Military Agency, the UA Independent Agency (which predominantly writes health insurance), and various smaller distribution channels. The Other Agencies contributed $220 million of life premium income, or 10% of Torchmark’s total in 2017, but contributed only 2% of net sales for the year.

24

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
Health Insurance 

Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement insurance, critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. In this analysis, all health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement are classified as limited-benefit plans.

Health premium accounted for 30% of our total premium in 2017, while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26% of total underwriting margin, reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance. As noted under the caption Life Insurance, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income.

The following table presents the summary of results for health insurance.

The UA Independent Agency consists of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark who may also sell for other companies. The UA Independent Agency was Torchmark’s largest health agency in terms of health premium income. In 2017, premium income was $364 million, representing 37% of Torchmark’s total health premium. Net sales were $61 million, or 39% of Torchmark’s health sales. This agency is also Torchmark’s largest producer of Medicare Supplement insurance, with Medicare Supplement premium income of $353 million. The UA Independent Agency represents 74% of all Torchmark Medicare Supplement premium and 92% of Medicare Supplement net sales. Medicare Supplement premium in this agency rose 3% in 2017. Total health premium increased 3% in 2017 and 2016. Medicare Supplement net sales increased 9% in 2017 from the prior year due to increases in individual and group sales. Group Medicare Supplement sales have historically fluctuated from period to period.

The Family Heritage Exclusive Agency primarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of Torchmark’s recruiting systems. The Family Heritage Agency contributed $57 million in net sales in 2017, compared with $51 million in 2016 and $50 million in 2015. Health premium income was $254 million in 2017, representing 26% of Torchmark’s 

28

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
health premium. This compared with $236 million or 25% of health premium in 2016 and $221 million or 24% in 2015. The average producing agent count was 995 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 923 for the same period in 2016, an increase of 8%.

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency represented 20% of all Torchmark health premium income at $196 million in 2017. The Liberty Agency markets limited-benefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance. Much of Liberty’s health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. In 2017, health premium income declined 3% after declining 4% during 2016. Liberty’s health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining Medicare Supplement block. Liberty's first-year collected premium increased 2% to $16 million in 2017 compared with an increase of 8% in 2016, reflecting the steady increase in net sales of limited-benefit plans in the agency.

Other distribution. Certain of our other distribution channels market health products, although their main emphasis is on life insurance. On a combined basis, they accounted for 17% of health premium in 2017 and 16% in 2016. The American Income Exclusive Agency primarily markets accident plans. The Direct Response group markets primarily Medicare Supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. Direct Response added $6 million of Medicare Supplement net sales in 2017 and 2016 and $5 million in 2015. 

In 2016 and 2015, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) imposed an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization. These fees totaled $621 thousand and $1.2 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were no fees for 2017.

Annuities. Our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2017 and 2016 were $1.25 billion and $1.29 billion, respectively. Underwriting income was $10.6 million, $9.4 million, and $4.6 million for the three years ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

While the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year, underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year. The significant increase in underwriting income in 2016 was primarily due to a slowdown in amortization as assumptions were adjusted to reflect longer retention of the annuity block than previously estimated as a result of the continuing low interest rate environment. Policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year. The majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. We do not currently market annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and health insurance products. Therefore, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.

Administrative expenses. Operating expenses are included in the Corporate and Other segment and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the Parent Company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2017.

Operating Expenses Selected Information

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Insurance administrative expenses were up 7.1% in 2017 when compared with the prior year after increasing 5.6% during 2016. As a percentage of total premium, insurance administrative expenses increased to 6.4% in 2017 from 6.3% in 2016 and 6.2% 2015. Total operating expenses increased 10.9% in 2017, after increasing 3.7% in 2016. The increase in other employee costs was due primarily to higher pension expense driven by lower interest rates.

The increase in information technology costs was due to investments that will enhance our customer experience, expand our data analytics capabilities, modernize our systems in order to improve our ability to react quickly to future changes, and bolster our information security programs.

The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to higher expense associated with equity awards, reflecting Torchmark's higher share price and higher stock option values as compared with the same period a year ago. The increase also reflects a one-time increase in stock-based compensation expense due to the effects of the Tax Legislation as previously discussed.

30

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
Investments. We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 14—Business Segments. It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs.”

We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used $7.1 billion of excess cash flow at the Parent Company to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. If we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares, but had instead invested it in interest-bearing assets, we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess Investment Income. The following table summarizes Torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Net of deferred acquisition costs, excluding the associated unrealized gains and losses thereon.

Excess investment income increased $15 million or 7% during 2017 after increasing 2% during 2016. The rate of growth was higher in 2017 than in 2016, in part, because excess investment income during 2016 was negatively impacted by an increase in financing costs attributable to the early refinancing of our 6.375% Senior Notes as is discussed below in the discussion of our financing costs. In addition, the growth rate in 2017 was positively impacted by the investment of positive cash flows relating to the collection in 2016 and 2017 of various receivables that had accumulated in prior years in the Medicare Part D business.

Excess investment income per diluted common share increased 10% during 2017 after increasing 6% during 2016. Excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases at a faster pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program.

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4% during the last three years. Growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the declining interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money and reinvested the 

31

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
proceeds from bonds that matured or were called or otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than what we earned on these bonds before their maturity or disposition. We currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets during the next five years will not exceed 1% to 3% of the portfolio, and will not have a significant negative impact on the growth of net investment income. Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Should interest rates rise, especially long-term rates, Torchmark's net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases. While such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio, we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 100 to 105 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of December 31, 2017 would be eliminated. Should interest rates increase further than that, we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and, more importantly, the ability, to hold our fixed maturities to maturity.

Required interest on net insurance policy liabilities reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments. As such, it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments. As discussed in Note 14-Business Segments, management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. The great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. That rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed. The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. As such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business.

Since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. Due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted-average discount rate of our in force block, we do not expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Analysis of Financing Costs

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financing costs increased $1 million or 1% from 2016 to 2017. In 2017, interest on short-term debt increased because of the increase in the weighted-average interest rate on such debt. Financing costs also increased $7 million or 9% from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to the additional interest expense on our funded debt associated with the issuance of a 6.125% Junior Subordinated Debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of the 6.375% Senior Notes. More information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the Financial Condition section of this report and in Note 11—Debt.

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for 

33

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.

Despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time, investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

The following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017.

Analysis of Realized Gains (Losses), Net of Tax

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share data)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As described in Note 4—Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, the Company recorded $245 thousand ($159 thousand, net of tax) in security write-downs. We did not incur any write downs in our fixed maturity portfolio as a result of other-than-temporary impairment for the years 2015 and 2016.

Investment Acquisitions. Torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If longer-term securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available, we do not relax our quality objectives, but instead, consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors.

During calendar years 2015 through 2017, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities, primarily in corporate bonds with longer-term maturities. The following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years. The effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield, commonly referred to as the “worst call date.” For non-callable bonds, the worst-call date is always the maturity date. For callable bonds, the worst-call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield, typically the first call date.

(2)Tax-equivalent basis, where the yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities.

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. Absent sales, however, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.

From 2015 through 2017, acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. All of the acquired securities were investment grade. In addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions, Torchmark invested $55 million in other long-term investments in 2017 compared with $20 million in 2016 and $32 million in 2015. 

New cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and interest received on existing investments. The amount of cash available for investment in 2016 was greater than 2015 due in part to the collection of various receivables from our Medicare Part D business. In some years, a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls. While calls increase funds available for investment, as noted earlier in this discussion, they can also have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than those of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $371 million in 2017, $182 million in 2016, and $178 million in 2015.

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
Approximately 95% of our investments at book value are in a diversified fixed maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, make up 3% of our investments. We also have insignificant investments in equity securities and other long-term investments. Because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2017, fixed maturities had a fair value of $17.0 billion, compared with $15.2 billion at December 31, 2016. The net unrealized gain position in the fixed maturity portfolio increased from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016 to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a decrease in credit spreads. The December 31, 2017 net unrealized gain consisted of gross unrealized gains of $2.1 billion offset by $83 million of gross unrealized losses, compared with the December 31, 2016 net unrealized gain which consisted of a gross unrealized gain of $1.3 billion and a gross unrealized loss of $216 million. 

Corporate securities, which consist of bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, were the largest component of the fixed maturity portfolio, representing 89% of amortized cost and 90% of fair value. The remainder of the portfolio is 

38

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
invested primarily in securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. municipalities. The Company holds insignificant amounts in foreign government bonds, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. As shown in the chart above, financial, utility, and energy sectors represented approximately 50% of the portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the total fixed maturity portfolio consists of 596 issuers, with 220 issuers within the financial, utility, and energy sectors.

The net unrealized gain of the fixed maturity portfolio increased $916 million from December 31, 2016. The financial, utility, energy, and basic materials sectors experienced increases of $237 million, $132 million, $117 million, and $117 million respectively, in net unrealized gains from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The fair value of the entire portfolio increased 11% for the period. Over the past year, oil and many other commodity prices have increased meaningfully to the benefit of our holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors. While a sustained period of low prices might lead to some downgrades in ratings, we do not currently anticipate any losses from defaults or write-downs in the foreseeable future.

For more information about our fixed maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2017 and 2016, including a discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see Note 4—Investments.

An analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by a composite rating at December 31, 2017 is shown in the following table. The composite rating for each security, other than private-placement securities managed by third parties, is the average of the security’s ratings as assigned by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. The composite quality rating is created using a methodology developed by Torchmark Corporation using ratings from the various rating agencies noted above. The composite quality rating is not a Standard & Poor's credit rating. Standard & Poor's does not sponsor, endorse or promote the composite quality rating and shall not be liable for any use of the composite quality rating. Included in the chart below are private placement fixed maturity holdings of $591 million at amortized cost ($613 million at fair value) for which the ratings were assigned by the third party managers.

Of the $15.0 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost as of December 31, 2017, $14.3 billion or 95% were investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below-investment-grade bonds were $702 million with an average rating of B+. Below-investment-grade bonds at amortized cost were 15% of our shareholders’ equity, excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities as of December 31, 2017. Overall, the total portfolio had a weighted average quality rating of BBB+ based on amortized cost, the same as at the end of 2016.

An analysis of changes in our portfolio of below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows:

Below-Investment Grade Fixed Maturities

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings. We are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending, we have no off-balance sheet investments, and we do not have any exposure to European sovereign debt at December 31, 2017. Our exposure to Puerto Rican obligations is insignificant. 

Market Risk Sensitivity. Torchmark’s investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio. Since 95% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, as is permitted by GAAP, these liabilities are not recorded at fair value.

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016. This table measures the effect of a parallel shift in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity. Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity. The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income.

Parent Company Liquidity. Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, operating expenses of the Parent, and Parent Company dividends to Torchmark shareholders. In 2017, the Parent received $454 million of cash dividends from its subsidiaries, compared with $438 million in 2016 and $466 million in 2015. Including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), the Parent Company had excess cash flow in 2017 of approximately $330 million, compared with $311 million in 2016 and $358 million in 2015. 

Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs, strategic acquisitions, additional shareholder dividends, or share repurchases. In 2018, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive approximately $450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately $320 to $330 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the Restrictions section of Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity. Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company. 

Short-Term Borrowings. An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million, which could be extended up to $1 billion. While Torchmark can request the extension, it is not guaranteed. In May 2016, Torchmark amended the facility to extend the maturity date to May 2021. The amendment also allowed for an additional $100 million term loan as discussed under the caption Credit Facility in Note 11—Debt. The facility is further designated as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the stand-by letters of credit as discussed below. As of December 31, 2017, we had available $249 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, compared with $310 million a year earlier. There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended December 31, 2017.

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2018 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, additional borrowings on our short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.

Consolidated Liquidity. Consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were $1.4 billion in 2017, compared with $1.2 billion in 2016 and $1.1 billion in 2015. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies received proceeds from maturities, calls, and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of $489 million in 2017, compared with $236 million in 2016 and $376 million in 2015. 

Our cash and short-term investments were $246 million at year-end 2017 and $148 million at year-end 2016. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These 

41

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
securities had a fair value of $17.0 billion at December 31, 2017. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As a part of its aforementioned credit facility, Torchmark had outstanding $177 million in stand-by letters of credit at December 31, 2017 and 2016. These letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. Any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require Torchmark to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs.

As of December 31, 2017, we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities. All of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies.

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of December 31, 2017.

(3)Purchase obligations include various long-term non-cancelable purchase commitments as well as commitments to provide capital for low-income housing tax credit interests.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital Resources. Torchmark’s capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in Note 11—Debt and the current maturity of funded debt), long-term funded debt, and shareholders’ equity. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in Note 11.

Debt: The carrying value of the long-term debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, the same as a year earlier.

On November 17, 2017, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $125 million in aggregate principal of Torchmark’s 5.275% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2057. The debentures were sold in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The initial purchaser of the 

42

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
debentures was outside the United States. The net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were $123.3 million, after giving effect to the discount payable to the initial purchaser and expenses of the offering of the debentures. Torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the $125 million outstanding principal of the 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures that were due December 15, 2052 and that were callable beginning December 15, 2017.

On April 5, 2016, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Torchmark’s 6.125% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2056. The debentures were sold pursuant to Torchmark’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed September 25, 2015. The net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were $290 million, after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering of the debentures. Torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the $250 million outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest of $8 million on its 6.375% Senior Notes that were due June 15, 2016. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

Subsidiary Capital: For the past several years, our insurance subsidiaries have targeted a capital ratio of approximately 325% of Company Action Level regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC) standards, a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. At December 31, 2017, our insurance subsidiaries had an aggregate RBC ratio of 314%, a decrease in the ratio from the prior year of 324% due to the reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Legislation previously discussed in the Results of Operations in this report. Should the NAIC adjust the RBC factors in 2018, as expected, to take into account the lower tax rate, we would expect a further reduction in our consolidated RBC ratio for the year ending December 31, 2018. At this time, target RBC levels for 2018 are yet to be determined pending discussion with regulators and rating agencies. Management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio.

Shareholder's Equity: As noted under the caption Analysis of Share Repurchases in this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program. Under this program, we acquired 4 million shares at a cost of $325 million in 2017, 5 million shares at a cost of $311 million in 2016, and 6 million shares for $359 million in 2015. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption Summary of Operations in this report.

Torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years. In the first quarter of 2015, it was increased to $0.135 per share from $0.1267 per share. In the first quarter of 2016, it was raised to $0.14 per share. Finally, in the first quarter of 2017, dividends were raised to $0.15 per share.

Shareholders’ equity was $6.2 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $4.6 billion at December 31, 2016, a $1.7 billion or 36% increase. During the twelve months since December 31, 2016, shareholders’ equity was reduced by $325 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and $88 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. However, it was increased by $1.5 billion of net income, $874 million of which was attributed to a tax adjustment as a result of the Tax Legislation and $870 million of after-tax unrealized gains, of which $275 million was attributed to a tax adjustment as a result of the Tax Legislation.

We plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to, share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in securities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our companies. If market conditions are favorable, we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity. 

Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner 

43

TMK 2017 FORM 10-K
as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders’ equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. From time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios. 

The following table presents selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the table presents the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmark’s capital structure. Excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on the fixed maturity portfolio from shareholders' equity is considered non-GAAP. Below we include the reconciliation to GAAP.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Amount added to (deducted from) comprehensive income to produce the stated GAAP item.

(2)Includes the value of insurance purchased.

(3)Torchmark’s debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting guidance requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity.

Torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 10.8 times in 2017, compared with 10.3 times in 2016 and 11.0 times in 2015 based on continuing operations. This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption Investments in this report.

Financial Strength Ratings. The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poor’s and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highest-rated insurers only to a small degree. An insurer rated A has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higher-rated categories. The plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, S&P reviewed our operations and financial outlook. Based on their review, they confirmed our "AA-" financial strength ratings at our insurance subsidiaries and Torchmark Corporation's senior debt "A" credit rating.

OTHER ITEMS

Litigation. Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since Torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Future Policy Benefits: Due to the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies.

Approximately 87% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2017 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Future Policy Benefits. Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. Torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended December 31, 2017.

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.

Deferred Acquisition Costs: Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Deferred Acquisition Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance purchased, is included in deferred acquisition costs. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies.

Over 99% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2017 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are “locked-in” at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2017.

Less than 1% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2017.

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable: This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities: We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk.

We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption Market Risk Sensitivity in this report. However, as discussed under the caption Financial Condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.

At times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies and in Note 4—Investments under the captions Fair Value Measurements in both notes.

Impairment of Investments: We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies and the discussions under the captions Investments and Realized Gains and Losses in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.

Defined benefit pension plans: We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2017, our gross liability under these plans was $603 million, but was offset by assets of $378 million.

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. For example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2017 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017.

(2)The expected return rate assumed was 6.96%.

The Company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broad-based studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales.

The criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in Note 9—Postretirement Benefits. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. Note 9—Postretirement Benefits also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.
