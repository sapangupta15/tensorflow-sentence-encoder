Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2010 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 The challenging global economic environment continues to provide headwinds for our business. This results in pricing pressures across our Risk and HR Solutions businesses. We continue to operate in a soft insurance pricing market, as property and casualty rates continue to decline, however, the level of exposure units, or volume, appears to be stabilizing. Exposure units have been negatively impacted by the global economy, which places pressure on our business in three primary ways:    

declining insurable risks due to decreasing asset values, including property values, payroll, number of active employees, and corporate revenues,   

client cost-driven behavior, where clients are actively looking to reduce spending in order to meet budget reductions, and increase risk retention, as a result of prioritizing their total spending, and   

sector specific weakness, including financial services, construction, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions, all of which have been particularly impacted by the current economic downturn.   

 Our revenue for 2010 increased as a result of acquisitions, including Hewitt's results from the date of the acquisition, new products and services, such as GRIP Solutions, and from improvement and stabilization in the market. We also continue to demonstrate expense discipline, while we invest in our businesses.  

 We have committed to our stockholders that we will focus on three key metrics: grow organically, expand margins, and increase earnings per share. The following is our measure of performance against these three metrics for 2010:    

Organic revenue growth, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was flat in 2010, however, this was an improvement compared to the prior year's organic revenue decline, as global economic conditions begin to stabilize following the economic slowdown that has impacted the global markets since 2008.   

Adjusted operating margin, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was 17.6% for Aon overall, 20.4% for the Risk Solutions segment, and 14.9% for the HR Solutions segment. Adjusted operating margins expanded in the Risk Solutions segment, but declined in the HR Solutions segment and for the Company overall.   

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Aon's stockholders, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results  General" below, was $3.12 per share in 2010, similar to 2009, demonstrating solid operational performance and effective capital management despite a difficult business environment.   

Additionally, the following is a summary of our 2010 financial results:    

Revenue increased $917 million, or 12%, to $8.5 billion due primarily to an increase from acquisitions, primarily Hewitt, net of dispositions and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, which was partially offset by lower fiduciary investment income of $19 million due to the decline in global interest rates. Organic revenue growth was flat in the Risk Solutions segment and 1% in the HR Solutions segment.   

Operating expenses increased $712 million from the prior year to $7.3 billion, primarily as a result of the inclusion of expenses from Hewitt and our smaller acquisitions, a $49 million non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets, $40 million of Hewitt related acquisition and integration costs,   

30 

unfavorable foreign currency translation, and the net pension curtailment gain recognized in 2009 of $78 million related to our U.S. and Canada defined benefit pension plans. These increases were partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $240 million, lower incentive costs, and restructuring and other operational expense savings.    

Our consolidated operating margin from continuing operations for the year improved to 14.4% in 2010 from 13.4% in 2009. The improvement in operating margin reflects lower costs and increased benefits related to our restructuring initiatives, partially offset by the pension curtailment gain and pension adjustment described above.   

Net income from continuing operations attributable to Aon stockholders increased $97 million, or 15%, from 2009 to $733 million.   

 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

 General  

 In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted pretax margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results.  

 Organic Revenue  

 We use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, reimbursable expenses, and unusual items. Supplemental information related to organic growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Statements of Income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages to the reported Commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages, has been provided in the "Review by Segment" caption, below.  

 Adjusted Operating Margins  

 We use adjusted operating margin as a measure of core operating performance of our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions businesses. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of noteworthy items, including restructuring charges, the pension adjustment, Hewitt related costs, and costs for anti-bribery and compliance initiatives. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to,  

31 

not instead of, our Consolidated Statements of Income. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported operating margin is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1)Includes unallocated expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenue.   

 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations  

 We also use adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as a measure of Aon's core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of restructuring charges, the pension adjustment, Hewitt related costs, and costs for anti-bribery and compliance initiatives, along with related income taxes. Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure to the reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions except per share data):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations  

 Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations, we have provided a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in  

32 

currencies between periods by translating last year's revenue, expenses and net income at this year's foreign exchange rates.  

 Summary of Results  

 The consolidated results of continuing operations follow (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consolidated Results for 2010 Compared to 2009  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $917 million, or 12%, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase principally reflects an $844 million, or 67%, increase in the HR Solutions segment, a $118 million, or 2%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment, partially offset by a $49 million decline in unallocated revenue. The 67% increase in the HR Solutions segment was principally driven by acquisitions, primarily Hewitt, net of dispositions, 1% organic revenue growth, and a 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation. The 2% increase in the Risk Solutions segment was primarily driven by a 1% increase from acquisitions, primarily Allied North America, net of dispositions, and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth was flat, an improvement from the declines experienced in the prior year, as a result of global economic conditions slowly improving. A $19 million decline in fiduciary investment income was due to a decline in global interest rates. In 2009, $49 million in unallocated revenue was related to our ownership in certain insurance investment funds acquired with Benfield. In 2010, this investment is no longer consolidated in our financial statements.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased $500 million, or 11%, over 2009. The increase reflects a $562 million, or 75%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $51 million increase in unallocated expenses, which was partially offset by a $113 million, or 3%, decrease in the Risk Solutions segment.  

33 

In total, the increase for the year was driven by the inclusion of Hewitt's operating expenses from the date of the acquisition, a net pension curtailment gain recognized in 2009 of $78 million related to our U.S. and Canada defined benefit pension plans, a $49 million non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets, and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, which more than offset lower restructuring costs, restructuring savings and other operational improvements.  

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses increased by $212 million, or 11%, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase reflects a $251 million, or 81%, increase in the HR Solutions segment and a $24 million increase in unallocated expenses, which was partially offset by a $63 million, or 4%, decrease in the Risk Solutions segment. The overall increase was due largely to the impact of the Hewitt acquisition, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses and intangible amortization from the acquisition date; higher E&O expenses as a result of the higher level of insurance recoveries in the prior year; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation; costs associated with the Manchester United Sponsorship, which commenced during the year; and other Hewitt related transaction and integration costs. These increased costs were partially offset by lower restructuring charges, restructuring savings, operational expense management, and Benfield integration costs in 2009.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income decreased $1 million, or 6%, from 2009, due to lower global interest rates.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $60 million, or 49%, from 2009 due mainly to an increase in the amount of debt outstanding related to the Hewitt acquisition, including $1.5 billion in notes and a $1.0 billion term loan, and $14 million in deferred financing costs attributable to a $1.5 billion Bridge Loan Facility that was put in place to finance the Hewitt acquisition, but was cancelled following the issuance of the notes.  

 Other Income  

 There was no Other income in 2010 versus $34 million in 2009. This decrease is primarily due to $4 million in losses in 2010 compared to $13 million in gains in 2009 related to the disposal of several small businesses, an $8 million loss related to the early extinguishment of debt primarily acquired in the Hewitt acquisition in 2010, and a $5 million gain in 2009 from the extinguishment of $15 million of junior subordinated debentures.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.1 billion, a 12% increase from $949 million in 2009. The increase in income was driven by the inclusion of Hewitt's operating results from the date of the acquisition, lower costs and increased benefits from restructuring initiatives, favorable foreign currency translation and operational improvement, which was partially offset by the pension curtailment gain recognized last year, Hewitt related transaction and integration costs, the 2010 pension adjustment related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and costs related to the Manchester United sponsorship.  

34 

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.4% in 2010 and 28.2% in 2009. The 2010 rate reflects the impact of the Hewitt acquisition in the fourth quarter, a favorable U.S. pension expense adjustment, which had a tax rate of 40%, and deferred tax adjustments. The 2009 tax rate was negatively impacted by a non-cash deferred tax expense on the U.S. pension curtailment gain, which had a tax rate of 40%. The underlying tax rate for continuing operations was 28.5% in 2010 and is estimated to be approximately 30% for 2011, reflecting changes in geographical mix of income following the Hewitt acquisition.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations increased to $759 million ($2.46 diluted net income per share) in 2010 from $681 million ($2.19 diluted net income per share) in 2009. Currency fluctuations positively impacted income from continuing operations in 2010 by $0.11 per diluted share, when the 2009 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2010 foreign exchange rates.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 In 2010, an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $27 million ($0.09 diluted net loss per share) was recorded compared to after-tax income from discontinued operations of $111 million ($0.38 diluted net income per share) in 2009. The loss in 2010 was driven by the settlement of legacy litigation related to the Buckner vs. Resource Life case. The 2009 results include the recognition of a $55 million foreign tax carryback related to the sale of CICA, a $43 million after-tax gain on the sale of AIS and a curtailment gain on the post-retirement benefit plan related to the CICA disposal.  

 Consolidated Results for 2009 Compared to 2008  

 Revenue  

 Revenue increased by $67 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase reflects a $108 million, or 2%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment and a $49 million increase associated with corporate ownership in insurance investments obtained as part of the acquisition of Benfield in November 2008, partially offset by an $89 million, or 7%, decrease in the HR Solutions segment. This 2% increase in the Risk Solutions segment was primarily driven by increased commissions and fees attributable to Benfield, partially offset by a $95 million decrease in fiduciary investment income due to declines in global interest rates, the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decline in organic revenue reflecting the weak economic conditions globally. The 7% decrease in the HR Solutions segment was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a 2% decline in organic revenue reflecting the impact of the economic downturn, and the impact of the previously announced termination of an outsourcing contract with AT&T.  

 Compensation and Benefits  

 Compensation and benefits increased by $16 million, essentially even with 2008. This increase reflects a $70 million, or 2%, increase in the Risk Solutions segment and a $7 million, or 12%, increase in unallocated expenses, partially offset by a $61 million, or 7%, decrease in the HR Solutions segment. The slight increase overall from last year was driven by the impact of Benfield and higher restructuring costs, which were offset by favorable foreign currency translation, restructuring savings, gains related to the pension curtailments and lower incentive compensation.  

35 

 Other General Expenses  

 Other general expenses decreased by $30 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease reflects a $16 million, or 1%, decline in the Risk Solutions segment and a $23 million, or 7%, decrease in the HR Solutions segment, partially offset by a $9 million increase in unallocated expenses. The overall decline was driven by favorable foreign exchange, lower E&O expenses due to insurance recoveries, restructuring savings, operational expense management, and reduced costs related to our FCPA and anti-corruption reviews and related compliance initiatives. These items exceeded the impact of Benfield, including increased intangible amortization related to the merger, and higher restructuring charges.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income, which represents income earned on operating cash balances and miscellaneous income-producing securities, decreased $48 million from 2008 and was driven mainly by lower investment balances and the global decline in interest rates in 2009.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense declined $4 million, due primarily to the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates, which was mostly offset by higher interest rates following the third quarter issuance of €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of long-term debt at a 6.25% coupon, which replaced debt borrowed at lower rates under our Euro credit facility.  

 Other Income  

 Other income increased $33 million to $34 million in 2009. This increase in income is primarily a result of hedging losses associated with the Benfield acquisition in 2008, partially offset by lower equity income recognized in 2008.  

 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes  

 Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $949 million, an 8% increase from $879 million in 2008. The improvement was driven by the additional earnings from Benfield and other acquisitions, restructuring and other operational expense savings, and the net pension curtailment gain, which more than offset the impact of higher restructuring costs, lower fiduciary investment and interest income and unfavorable foreign currency translation.  

 Income Taxes  

 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.2% and 27.5% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase reflects changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income.  

 Income from Continuing Operations  

 Income from continuing operations increased to $681 million ($2.19 diluted net income per share) from $637 million ($2.04 diluted net income per share) in 2008. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted income from continuing operations in 2009 by $0.02 per diluted share when the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income is translated using 2009 foreign exchange rates.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 Income from discontinued operations decreased $730 million to $111 million ($0.38 diluted net income per share) in 2009 from $841 million ($2.76 diluted net income per share) in 2008. The 2009  

36 

results include the recognition of a $55 million foreign tax credit carryback related to the sale of CICA, the gain on the sale of AIS, results from our P&C operations through the date of disposal, a curtailment gain on the post-retirement benefit plan related to the CICA disposal, and residual tax settlements related to our Aon Warranty Group disposal. The 2008 results include the gain on the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries ($935 million) and the operations of CICA and Sterling for the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by a loss recognized on our remaining P&C operations.  

 Restructuring Initiatives  

 Aon Hewitt Restructuring Plan  

 On October 14, 2010, we announced a global restructuring plan (the "Aon Hewitt Plan") in connection with our acquisition of Hewitt. The Aon Hewitt Plan, which will continue into 2013, is intended to streamline operations across the combined Aon Hewitt organization. The restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $325 million through the end of the plan, consisting of approximately $180 million in employee termination costs and approximately $145 million in real estate lease rationalization costs. An estimated 1,500 to 1,800 positions globally, predominately non-client facing, are expected to be eliminated as part of the plan.  

 As of December 31, 2010, approximately 360 jobs have been eliminated under the Aon Hewitt Plan and total expenses of $52 million have been incurred. All costs associated with the Aon Hewitt Plan are included in the HR Solutions segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 The following summarizes the restructuring and related costs, by type, that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Hewitt Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause the Company to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.   

 The restructuring plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver approximately $280 million of annual savings in 2013. We expect to achieve approximately $355 million in annual cost savings across Aon Hewitt in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to the restructuring plan, and additional savings in areas such as information technology, procurement and public company costs. All of the components of the restructuring and integration plan are not finalized and actual total savings, costs and timing may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the plan.  

37 

           Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan  

 We announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with our 2008 merger with Benfield. The restructuring plan is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 700 job eliminations. Additionally, duplicate space and assets will be abandoned. We originally estimated that this plan would result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, of which $104 million was recorded as part of the Benfield purchase price allocation and $81 million of which was expected to result in future charges to earnings. During 2009, we reduced the Benfield purchase price allocation by $49 million to reflect actual severance costs being lower than originally estimated. We currently estimate the Aon Benfield Plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $155 million, of which $55 million was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation, $26 million and $55 million has been recorded in earnings during 2010 and 2009, respectively, and an estimated additional $19 million will be recorded in future earnings.  

 As of December 31, 2010, approximately 690 jobs have been eliminated under the Aon Benfield Plan. Total payments of $105 million have been made under this plan to date.  

 The following is a summary of the restructuring and related expenses by type that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative related to the Aon Benfield Plan (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Actual costs, when incurred, will vary due to changes in the assumptions built into this plan. Significant assumptions likely to change when plans are finalized and implemented include, but are not limited to, changes in severance calculations, changes in the assumptions underlying sublease loss calculations due to changing market conditions, and changes in the overall analysis that might cause us to add or cancel component initiatives. 

(2)Other costs associated with restructuring initiatives, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees, are recognized when incurred.   

 All costs associated with the Aon Benfield Plan are included in the Risk Solutions segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations into 2011.  

 The Aon Benfield Plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver cumulative cost savings of approximately $122 million in 2011. We estimate that we realized approximately $100 million, and $45 million, of cost savings in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The actual savings, total costs and timing of the restructuring plan may vary from those estimated due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions of the plan, and foreign exchange rates.  

38 

 2007 Restructuring Plan  

 In 2007, the Company announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth to better serve clients (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan resulted in approximately 4,700 job eliminations and the Company has closed or consolidated several offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. The total cumulative pretax charges for the 2007 Plan were $748 million. The Company does not expect any further expenses to be incurred in the 2007 Plan. Costs related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 We estimate that we realized cost savings, before any reinvestment of savings, of approximately $476 million and $269 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and expect annual cost savings of approximately $536 million in 2011.  

 The following summarizes the restructuring and related expenses by type that have been incurred related to the 2007 Plan (in millions):

 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  

 Liquidity  

 Executive Summary  

 Our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with financial flexibility to create long-term value for our stockholders. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, restructuring, pension obligations and stockholder dividends.  

 Cash and short-term investments increased $492 million to $1.1 billion in 2010, demonstrating our strong balance sheet which provides us with significant financial flexibility. During 2010, cash flow from operating activities, excluding client held funds, increased $271 million to $768 million. Uses of funds in 2010 included the acquisition of Hewitt and the repurchase of $250 million of common stock. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Hewitt for a total purchase price of $4.9 billion with 50% cash and 50%  

39 

equity in order to maintain our investment grade rating. We used the proceeds from a $1.5 billion senior notes offering and $1.0 billion term loan to fund the cash component and issued 61 million shares to fund the equity component of the purchase price. The $1.5 billion in financing includes three traunches of unsecured notes at attractive rates with staggered maturities of 5 years, 10 years and 30 years. The term loan facility is a $1 billion 3-year facility. We chose these maturities to help manage our liquidity risk by ensuring a material amount of debt does not become due in any one year.  

 Our investment grade rating is important to us for a number of reasons, the most important of which is preserving our financial flexibility. If our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, the interest expense on any outstanding balances on our credit facilities would increase and we could incur additional requests for pension contributions. To manage unforeseen situations, we have committed credit lines of approximately $1.3 billion and we manage our business to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings as evidenced by the equity component of the purchase price for Hewitt.  

 Summary Cash Flow table  

 The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes Hewitt activity from the date of acquisition, October 1, 2010.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Activities  

 Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased $380 million compared with 2009, with $109 million due to the change in funds held on behalf of clients. Excluding the change in client held funds, cash provided from operating activities increased $271 million compared to 2009. The primary contributors to cash flow from operations in 2010, excluding the change in funds held on behalf of clients, were net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1.4 billion, partially offset by a $280 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $130 million decrease related to our pension and other post employment plans. The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily related to post-acquisition Hewitt incentive compensation payments. Cash contributions to our major defined pension plans in excess of pension expense were $130 million in 2010 and $404 million in 2009. Pension contributions during 2010 were $288 million and $437 million in 2009. In 2011, we expect to contribute $403 million to our major pension plans.  

40 

 Investing Activities  

 Cash used for investing activities in 2010 was $2.6 billion. Acquisitions used $2.0 billion, primarily related to the acquisition of Hewitt. Net purchases of non-fiduciary short-term investments used $337 million, and capital expenditures used $180 million. The sale of businesses used $30 million, consisting of proceeds from several small dispositions which were more than offset by a $38 million use of cash for a litigation settlement related to a previously disposed of business. Sales, net of purchases, of long-term investments provided $56 million.  

 Cash used for investing activities was $139 million in 2009, primarily comprised of $274 million paid to acquire 14 businesses, including Allied North America and FCC Global Insurance Services, $158 million paid to purchase long-term investments, and $140 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $332 million of net proceeds from the sales of non-fiduciary short- and long-term investments.  

 Cash provided by investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2008. During 2008, we received $2.8 billion in proceeds from the sale of CICA and Sterling, partially offset by $1.1 billion paid for Benfield and other acquisitions.  

 Financing Activities  

 Cash provided by financing activities during 2010 was $1.8 billion. During 2010 we received $2.9 billion from the issuance of debt, primarily a $600 million 3.5% note due in 2015, a $600 million 5% note due in 2020, a $300 million 6.25% note due 2040, and a $1 billion three-year term note due in 2013, all associated with the acquisition of Hewitt. Additionally, we borrowed $308 million from our Euro credit facility and $100 million of commercial paper during the year, which were repaid as of year end. We also repaid $299 million of debt assumed in the Hewitt acquisition. Other uses of cash include $250 million for share repurchases and $175 million for dividends to shareholders. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan were $194 million.  

 Cash used for financing activities in 2009 was $649 million. We purchased $590 million of treasury shares, and received $163 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan. During 2009, we issued €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures. These funds were primarily used to pay off our Euro credit facility borrowings. We also used $100 million for the repayment of short-term debt related to a variable interest entity ("VIE") for which we were the primary beneficiary. Cash dividends of $165 million were paid to shareholders.  

 Cash used for financing activities in 2008 was $2.2 billion. This was primarily comprised of $1.9 billion of share repurchase activity, less the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $246 million; the net repayment of debt of $386 million, almost entirely related to our Euro credit facility; and dividends of $171 million.  

 Cash and Investments  

 At December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.1 billion, an increase of $492 million from December 31, 2009. Of the total balance recorded at December 31, 2010, approximately $60 million was restricted as to its use. At December 31, 2010, $521 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and $610 million was held by our subsidiaries in other countries. Due to differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have an unfavorable tax impact.  

 In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds.

Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly, depending on when we collect the premiums, claims and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are required to be invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of $3.5 billion and fiduciary receivables of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2010. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments are not owned by us, and cannot be used for general corporate purposes.  

 As disclosed in Note 17 "Fair Value and Financial Instruments," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. Money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Based on market convention, we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We do not believe that there are any market liquidity issues affecting the fair value of these investments.  

 As of December 31, 2010, our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of $2.6 billion and are reported as cash equivalents, short-term investments or fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature and initial maturity.  

 The following table summarizes our fiduciary assets and non-fiduciary cash and investments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Share Repurchase Program  

 In 2007, our Board of Directors increased the authorized share repurchase program to $4.6 billion of our outstanding common stock. Shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. Any repurchased shares will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2010, we repurchased 6.1 million shares at a cost of $250 million. In 2009, we repurchased 15.1 million shares at a cost of $590 million. In 2008, we repurchased 42.6 million shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2005, we have repurchased a total of 111.9 million shares for an aggregate cost of $4.6 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we were authorized to purchase up to $15 million of additional shares under this share repurchase program. The timing and amount of future purchases will be based on market and other conditions.  

42 

 In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which up to $2 billion of common stock may be repurchased from time to time depending on market conditions or other factors through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will commence under the new share repurchase program upon conclusion of the active program.  

 In December 2010, Aon retired 40 million shares of treasury stock.  

 For information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2010, see Item 5  "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" above.  

 Shelf Registration Statement  

 On June 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt, preferred stock, common stock and convertible securities. Our $1.5 billion in unsecured notes, sold on September 7, 2010 to finance the Hewitt acquisition, were issued under this registration statement. The availability of any further potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. There can be no assurance regarding when, or if, we will issue any additional securities under the registration statement.  

 Credit Facilities  

 We have a three-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. ("U.S. Facility"). Sixteen banks are participating in the U.S. Facility, which is for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support. Additionally, we have a five-year €650 million ($853 million at December 31, 2010 exchange rates) multi-currency foreign credit facility ("Euro Facility") available, which was entered into in October 2010 and expires in October 2015. The Euro Facility replaces a €650 million multi-currency revolving loan credit facility which was entered into in 2005 and expired in October 2010. At December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings under either of the credit facilities. We can access these facilities on a same-day basis.  

 For both our U.S. and Euro Facilities, the two most significant covenants require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted for Hewitt related transaction costs and up to $50 million in non-recurring cash charges ("Adjusted EBITDA") to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to Adjusted EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. We were in compliance with these and all other covenants as of December 31, 2010.  

 As noted above, in connection with the Hewitt acquisition, we obtained a Term Loan Credit Facility which provided up to $1 billion of unsecured borrowings. Concurrent with this term loan, we also obtained a Bridge Loan Facility which provided unsecured bridge financing of up to $1.5 billion. In lieu of drawing under the Bridge Loan Facility, on September 7, 2010 we issued $1.5 billion in unsecured senior notes and terminated the Bridge Loan Facility. On the acquisition date, October 1, 2010, we drew down the $1.0 billion Term Loan Credit Facility.

 Rating Agency Ratings  

 The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt at February 25, 2011 appear in the table below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether.  

 Letters of Credit  

 We have outstanding letters of credit ("LOCs") totaling $71 million at December 31, 2010. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to our Canadian pension plan scheme, cover deductible retentions for our workers compensation program, secure a sublease agreement for office space, secure one of our U.S. pension plans, and cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. In addition, we have a contingent LOC for up to $85 million that is in support of a potential acquisition, which is expected to close in 2011.  

 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources  

 We believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditures, pension contributions, cash restructuring costs, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1, "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors."  

 Contractual Obligations  

 Summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and minimum funding   

44 

requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.    

(2)In 2007, our principal U.K subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £9.4 million ($15 million) per year to that pension plan for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by approximately 5% on each April 1. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated winding-up deficit was £270 million ($421 million). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the winding-up deficit be paid. 

(3)Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including what is to be purchased, at what price and the approximate timing of the transaction. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or for claims outsourcing in the U.K. 

(4)Excludes $70 million of unfunded commitments related to an investment in a limited partnership due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when the limited partnership will request funding. 

(5)Excludes $85 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements will be made.   

 Financial Condition  

 At December 31, 2010, our net assets of $8.3 billion, representing total assets minus total liabilities, were $2.9 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2009. Working capital increased $221 million to $1.6 billion.  

 Balance sheet categories that reflected large variances from last year included the following:    

Cash and short-term investments increased $492 million, resulting primarily from cash from operations including Hewitt, partially offset by cash used for our ongoing share repurchase program, funding of our various pension plans, and the acquisition of businesses.   

Total Receivables increased $649 million due primarily to the inclusion of Hewitt.   

Goodwill and Other Intangibles increased $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, due principally to the acquisition of Hewitt as well as other smaller acquisitions during 2010.   

Short-term debt increased $482 million, due principally to the reclassification of our 5.05% CAD 375 million ($372 million at December 31, 2010 exchange rates) debt securities from long-term, as the due date of the securities is April 2011, and the inclusion of $100 million of our $1 billion Senior Term Loan Credit Facility which is due within one year from the balance sheet date.   

Long-term debt increased by $2.0 billion, principally reflecting the draw down of $1.0 billion under the Term Loan Credit Facility, of which $25 million has been repaid and $100 million has been included in Short-term debt, and the issuance of $1.5 billion in notes to fund the Hewitt acquisition, partially offset by the early extinguishment of $299 million in debt assumed in the Hewitt acquisition, and the repayment of $47 million of debt held by PEPS I, a consolidated VIE.   

45 

           Borrowings  

 Total debt at December 31, 2010 was $4.5 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion from December 31, 2009, due principally to the draw down of the $1.0 billion Term Credit Loan Facility and the issuance of $1.5 billion in unsecured senior notes related to the Hewitt acquisition (see Note 9 "Debt").  

 In December 2010, we prepaid $299 million of debt assumed in the Hewitt acquisition and used a portion of PEPS I restricted cash to repurchase $47 million of debt held by PEPS I, a consolidated VIE.  

 In October 2010, we replaced our five-year €650 million ($853 million at December 31, 2010 exchange rates) multi-currency foreign credit facility, which expired in October 2010, with a new five-year €650 million Euro Facility which expires in 2015.  

 In 2010, we reclassified our indirect wholly owned subsidiary's 5.05% CAD 375 million ($372 million at December 31, 2010 exchange rates) debt securities, which are guaranteed by Aon, to Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as the due date of the securities, April 2011, is less than one year from the current balance sheet date. We are exploring alternatives to refinance this obligation, and how we proceed will depend upon our liquidity profile and debt market conditions, among other considerations.  

 Our total debt as a percentage of total capital attributable to Aon stockholders was 35.3% and 27.2% at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The increase in the debt to capital ratio at December 31, 2010 is attributable to the $2.5 billion in debt financing issued to fund the Hewitt acquisition.  

 In 1997, we created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust ("Trust"), for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities ("Capital Securities"). We received cash and 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the "Debentures") to Aon Capital A. These transactions were structured such that the net cash flows from Aon to Aon Capital A matched the cash flows from Aon Capital A to the third party investors. We determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and, thus reflected the Debentures as long-term debt. During the first half of 2009, we repurchased $15 million face value of the Capital Securities for approximately $10 million, resulting in a $5 million gain, which is reported in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. To facilitate the legal release of the obligation created through the Debentures associated with this repurchase and future repurchases, we dissolved the Trust effective June 25, 2009. This dissolution resulted in the exchange of the Capital Securities held by third parties for the Debentures. Also in connection with the dissolution of the Trust, the $24 million of common equity of Aon Capital A held by us was exchanged for $24 million of Debentures, which were then cancelled. Following these actions, $687 million of Debentures remain outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The Debentures are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027 or are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at our option upon the occurrence of certain events.  

 Equity  

 Equity at December 31, 2010 was $8.3 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion from December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from $2.5 billion in shares issued in connection with the Hewitt acquisition, net income of $732 million and stock-based compensation of $221 million, which was partially offset by share repurchases of $250 million and $175 million of dividends to shareholders.  

 Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $242 million since December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting the following:    

a decline in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $133 million, which was attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,   

46 

reclassification of $44 million to Retained earnings due to the adoption, effective January 1, 2010, of new accounting guidance which resulted in the consolidation of PEPS I,   

an increase of $41 million in net post-retirement benefit obligations, and   

net derivative losses of $24 million.   

 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  

 Consolidated Variable Interest Entities  

 In 2001, we sold the vast majority of our limited partnership ("LP") portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. In accordance with the recently issued VIE guidance, former QSPEs must now be assessed to determine if they are VIEs. We concluded that PEPS I is a VIE and that we hold a variable interest in PEPS I. We also concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of PEPS I, as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance and we have the obligation or right to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to PEPS I. As a result of adopting this new guidance, we consolidated PEPS I effective January 1, 2010. The financial statement impact of consolidating PEPS I resulted in:    

the removal of the $87 million PEPS I preferred stock, previously reported in investments, and   

the addition of $77 million of equity method investments in LP's; cash of $57 million, of which $52 million was restricted; long-term debt of $47 million; a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax of $44 million; and an increase in retained earnings of $44 million.   

 In December 2010, the majority of PEPS I restricted cash was used to repurchase $47 million in PEPS I debt, with the remaining cash now available for general use.  

 As part of the original transaction, we were required to purchase from PEPS I additional below investment grade securities equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they were requested. As of December 31, 2010, we are no longer required to purchase additional securities as a result of the repayment of the $47 million in long-term debt; however, we will continue to fund any unfunded equity commitments. The commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments. We funded $1 million in 2010, did not fund any commitments in 2009, and funded $2 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, the unfunded commitments decreased to $13 million as some of the commitment periods have expired.  

 Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities  

 At December 31, 2008 and continuing through December 18, 2009, we consolidated the following VIEs:    

Juniperus Insurance Opportunity Fund Limited ("Juniperus"), which is an investment vehicle that invests in an actively managed and diversified portfolio of insurance risks, and   

Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited ("JCHL"), which provides investment management and related services to Juniperus.   

 Prior to December 18, 2009, based on our percentage equity interest in the Juniperus Class A shares, we bore a majority of the expected residual return and losses. Similarly, our voting and economic interest percentage in JCHL required us to absorb a majority of JCHL's expected residual returns and losses. We were considered the primary beneficiary of both companies, and as such, these entities were consolidated. As of December 18, 2009, our equity interest in Juniperus declined to 38%, and we held a 39% voting and economic interest in JCHL. Based on our holdings, we no longer are  

47 

considered to be the primary beneficiary of either entity and have therefore deconsolidated both entities.  

 At December 31, 2010, we held a 36% interest in Juniperus which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Our potential loss at December 31, 2010 is limited to our investment of $73 million in Juniperus, which is recorded in Investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have not provided any financing to Juniperus other than previously contractually required amounts.  

 Juniperus and JCHL had combined assets and liabilities of $121 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $36 million of pretax income from Juniperus and JCHL. We recognized $16 million of after-tax income, after allocating the appropriate share of net income to the non-controlling interests.  

 We previously owned an 85% economic equity interest in Globe Re Limited ("Globe Re"), a VIE, which provided reinsurance coverage for a defined portfolio of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts underwritten by a third party for a limited period which ended June 1, 2009. We consolidated Globe Re as we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. In connection with the winding up of its operations, Globe Re repaid its $100 million of short-term debt and our equity investment from available cash in 2009. We recognized $2 million of after-tax income from Globe Re in 2009, taking into account the share of net income attributable to non-controlling interests. Globe Re was fully liquidated in the third quarter of 2009.  

 REVIEW BY SEGMENT  

 General  

 We serve clients through the following segments:    

Risk Solutions (formerly Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services) acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, via consultation, as well as negotiation and placement of insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.   

HR Solutions (formerly Consulting) partners with organizations to solve their most complex benefits, talent and related financial challenges, and improve business performance by designing, implementing, communicating and administering a wide range of human capital, retirement, investment management, health care, compensation and talent management strategies.   

 Risk Solutions  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. During 2010 we continued to see a "soft market", which began in 2007, in our retail brokerage product line. In a soft market, premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the  

48 

premiums paid by insureds. In 2010, pricing decreased in both our retail and reinsurance brokerage product lines and we expect similar pricing declines to continue into 2011.  

 Additionally, beginning in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2010, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. Weak global economic conditions have reduced our customers' demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products, which have had a negative impact on our operational results.  

 Risk Solutions generated approximately 75% of our consolidated total revenues in 2010. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients' policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.  

 We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage. Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, health care providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide products and services via GRIP Solutions; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide risk consulting, actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.  

 In February 2009, we completed the sale of the U.S. operations of Cananwill, our premium finance business. In June and July of 2009, we entered into agreements with third parties with respect to our international premium finance businesses, whereby these third parties began originating, financing, and servicing premium finance loans generated by referrals from our brokerage operations.  

 In November 2008 we expanded our product offerings through the merger with Benfield, a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. Benfield products were integrated with our existing reinsurance products in 2009.  

 Revenue  

 Risk Solutions commissions, fees and other revenue was as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

49 

 In 2010, commissions, fees and other revenue increased $137 million or 2% from 2009 driven primarily by the increase from acquisitions, primarily Allied North America, net of dispositions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth was flat in 2010.  

 Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other revenue growth for 2010 versus 2009 is as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The 6% increase in Americas reflects the impact of the Allied acquisition, net of small dispositions, and favorable foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth was flat as strong growth in Latin America and benefits related to GRIP were partially offset by declines in the US Retail and Canadian operations.  

 United Kingdom commissions, fees and other revenue declined 3% driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 2% organic revenue decline reflecting weak market conditions and lower exposure units.  

 Europe, Middle East & Africa commissions, fees and other revenue increased 1% driven primarily by the net favorable impact of acquisitions offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The flat organic revenue growth was principally due to weak economic conditions and lower exposure units in Continental Europe, partially offset by strong growth in the emerging markets of Middle East and Africa.  

 Asia Pacific commissions, fees and other revenue increased 14%, due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and 3% organic revenue growth, which was driven largely by growth in Australia, New Zealand and certain emerging markets, partially offset by declines in Japan and Hong Kong.  

 Reinsurance commissions, fees and other revenue decreased 3%. Organic revenue decreased 3% primarily resulting from decreases in pricing and higher retentions by insurers, primarily in treaty placements, partially offset by revenue growth in capital markets transaction and advisory services. Favorable foreign currency translation offset the unfavorable impact related to net dispositions.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased $294 million or 33% from 2009 to $1.2 billion in 2010. In 2010, operating income margins in this segment were 18.6%, up 430 basis points from 14.3% in 2009. Contributing to increased operating income and margins were lower restructuring costs of $267 million, savings related to the restructuring plan and other cost savings initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, and a $15 million reduction related to the 2009 Benfield integration costs. The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher E&O expenses as a result of insurance recoveries in the prior year, the 2009 net pension curtailment gain of $54 million, and a $19 million reduction in investment income.

 HR Solutions  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of Hewitt, one of the world's leading human resource consulting and outsourcing companies. Hewitt operates globally together with Aon's existing consulting and outsourcing operations under the newly created Aon Hewitt brand. Hewitt's operating results are included in Aon's results of operations beginning October 1, 2010.  

 Our HR Solutions segment generated approximately 25% of our consolidated total revenues in 2010 and provides a broad range of human capital services, as follows:  

 Consulting Services:    

Health and Benefits advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs that attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence management, benefits administration, data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory and elective benefits services.   

Retirement specializes in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration.   

Compensation focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.   

Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change management.   

 Outsourcing Services:    

Benefits Outsourcing applies our HR expertise primarily through defined benefit (pension), defined contribution (401(k)), and health and welfare administrative services. Our model replaces the resource-intensive processes once required to administer benefit plans with more efficient, effective, and less costly solutions.   

Human Resource Business Processing Outsourcing ("HR BPO") provides market-leading solutions to manage employee data; administer benefits, payroll and other human resources processes; and record and manage talent, workforce and other core HR process transactions as well as other complementary services such as absence management, flexible spending, dependent audit and participant advocacy.   

 Beginning in late 2008, the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets created significant uncertainty in the marketplace. Weak economic conditions globally continued throughout 2010. The prolonged economic downturn is adversely impacting our clients' financial condition and therefore the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. While we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time, these challenges are reducing demand for some of our services and putting  

51 

continued pressure on pricing of those services, which is having an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.  

 Revenue  

 In 2010, Commissions, fees and other revenue of $2.1 billion was 67% higher than 2009, reflecting the impact of the Hewitt acquisition. Commissions, fees and other revenue were as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Organic revenue growth was 1% in 2010, as detailed in the following reconciliation:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consulting services increased $312 million or 29%, reflecting the inclusion of Hewitt revenue from the date of acquisition, organic revenue growth of 1%, driven mainly by solid growth in global compensation consulting, and favorable foreign currency translation.  

 Outsourcing revenue increased $540 million, or 283%, driven by the inclusion of Hewitt from the date of acquisition and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 1% decrease in organic revenue due primarily to a decline in project-related revenue and price compression in benefits administration.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income was $234 million, an increase of $31 million, or 15%, from 2009. This increase was principally driven by the inclusion of Hewitt's operating results and expense savings driven by operational improvement, partially offset by higher restructuring costs, Hewitt related transaction and integration costs, and the net pension curtailment gain in 2009 of $20 million. Operating margins in this segment for 2010 were 11.1%, a decrease of 490 basis points from 16.0% in 2009, driven largely by the mix of businesses following the acquisition of Hewitt and the impact of higher amortization of intangibles expense associated with the Hewitt acquisition.  

52 

           Unallocated Income and Expense  

 A reconciliation of our operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows (in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Unallocated operating loss includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments. In 2009, it also included revenue and expenses from our equity ownership in insurance investments obtained as part of the Benfield acquisition. Net unallocated expenses increased $120 million to $202 million for 2010. The increase was driven mainly by the $49 million non-cash U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense resulting from an adjustment to the market-related value of plan assets, Hewitt transaction costs of $21 million and the net impact of the insurance investments in 2009.  

 Interest income consists primarily of income earned on our operating cash balances and other income-producing securities. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $15 million in 2010, a decrease of $1 million from 2009 reflecting the overall impact of lower interest rates.  

 Interest expense, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, increased $60 million primarily as a result of the $2.5 billion in debt issued in connection with the Hewitt acquisition and costs associated with the cancellation of a $1.5 billion bridge loan commitment, which was replaced by the issuance of $1.5 billion in notes prior to the acquisition being completed.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  

 In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements.

 Restructuring  

 Workforce reduction costs  

 The method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are one-time costs. We account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula.  

 We estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated. We recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.  

 Lease consolidation costs  

 Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it, we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement. To determine the loss, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes.  

 Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses  

 Accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value.  

 Most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. However, we may discount the severance arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. Accretion of the discount occurs over the remaining life of the liability.  

 For the remaining lease term or severance payout, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount, if material. The discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded.  

 Other associated costs of exit and disposal activities  

 We recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and legal fees.  

 Asset impairments may result from large-scale restructurings and we account for these impairments in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life.  

 Pensions  

 We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada.  

54 

 Significant changes to pension plans  

 Our U.S., U.K. and Canadian pension plans were previously closed to new entrants. Effective January 1, 2009, our Netherlands plan was also closed to new entrants. In 2007, future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in our U.K. plans. Effective April 1, 2009, we ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our two U.S. plans. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain of $83 million in 2009. In 2010, we ceased crediting future benefits relating to service in our Canadian defined benefit pension plans. We recognized a curtailment loss of $5 million related to the Canadian pension plans in 2009.  

 Recognition of gains and losses and prior service  

 We defer the recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience and asset performance.  

 Unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the Netherlands and Canada, or the average life expectancy of the U.S. and U.K. plan members. After the effective date of the plan amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service, unrecognized gains and losses will also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the Canadian plans. We amortize any prior service costs or credits which arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.  

 As of December 31, 2010, the pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.  

 The following table discloses our combined experience loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2011 amortization of loss by country (amounts in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The unrecognized prior service cost at December 31, 2010 was $17 million in the U.K.  

 For the U.S. pension plans we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year's value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2010, the market-related value of assets was $1.4 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position which is based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of plan assets was $1.2 billion.  

55 

 Our plans in the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada use fair value to determine expected return on assets.  

 Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation  

 The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Includes investments in infrastructure, real estate, limited partnerships and hedge funds. 

 In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.  

 The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The actual asset allocation at December 31, 2010 was 61% equity and 39% fixed income securities for the qualified plan.  

 The investment policy for each U.K. pension plan is generally determined by the plans' trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation represents a weighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change. In total, as of December 31, 2010, the U.K. plans were invested 49% in equity and 51% in fixed income securities. The Netherlands' plan was invested 43% in equity and 57% in fixed income securities. The Canadian plan was invested 71% in equity and 29% in fixed income securities.  

 Impact of changing economic assumptions  

 Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.  

 Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated 2011 pension expense (in millions):

 Estimated future contributions  

 We estimate contributions of approximately $403 million in 2011 as compared with $288 million in 2010.  

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either trademarks, customer relationships, technology, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles. Our goodwill and other intangible balances at December 31, 2010 increased to $8.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, compared to $6.1 billion and $791 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the Hewitt acquisition.  

 Although goodwill is not amortized, we test it for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also test acquired trademarks (which also are not amortized) for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2010 or 2009 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or trademarks.  

 We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.  

 The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.  

57 

 In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2010 and 2009, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.  

 We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations.  

 Contingencies  

 We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlement strategy. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved.  

 Share-based Payments  

 Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest during that period based on the achievement of service or performance conditions. Thus, we have reduced expense for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. When the terms of an award require no additional service, the award is fully expensed at the grant date. When awards are modified, we account for the incremental shares at the fair market value at the date of modification. Expense recognition begins on the date the service period begins, which can precede or be after the grant date, depending on the provisions of the award.  

 Option accounting  

 We use a lattice-binomial option-pricing model to value stock options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options, and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on our stock.  

58 

 In terms of the assumptions used in the lattice-based model, we:    

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model. In 2008 and prior years, we stratified between executives and key employees. Beginning in 2009, after reviewing additional historical data, we changed the valuation model to stratify employees between those receiving Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP") options, Special Stock Plan options, and all other option grants. We believe that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns.   

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate, and   

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   

 The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.  

 Restricted stock unit awards  

 Employees may either receive service-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") or performance-based awards, which ultimately result in the receipt of RSUs, if the employee achieves his or her objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We account for service-based awards by expensing the total award value over the service period. We calculate the total award value by multiplying the estimated total number of shares to be delivered by the fair value on the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures based on our actual historical experience and consider dividend discounts when determining the fair value of the RSUs. Performance-based RSUs may be immediately vested at the end of the performance period or may have a future additional service period. Generally, our performance awards are fixed, which means we determine the fair value of the award at the grant date, estimate the number of shares to be delivered at the end of the performance period, and recognize the expense over the performance or vesting period, whichever is longer. These estimates take into account performance to date as well as an assessment of future performance. These assessments are made by management using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the expense recognized.  

 The largest performance-based stock plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. The 2008 to 2010 performance period ended on December 31, 2010, and the 2007 to 2009 performance period ended on December 31, 2009. The LPP currently has two ongoing performance periods: from 2009 to 2011 and 2010 to 2012. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both LPP plans would have increased our 2010 expense by approximately $4 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $4 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as well as U.S. federal and state tax laws. The estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item. We consider the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items.  

 The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management's assumptions and estimates about  

59 

future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.  

 We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a "more likely than not" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations to the extent they are considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according to the Internal Revenue Code, and could materially affect our future effective tax rate.  

 We base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those which deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.  

 We operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:    

the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this trend will continue,   

to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities,   

we may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed, and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance, and   

tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes.
