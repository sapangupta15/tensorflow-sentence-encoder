Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

(Amounts in millions)  

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain Balance Sheet items. From time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.  

Interest Rates   

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations as the majority of our debt (approximately 84% as of December 31, 2008) bore interest at fixed rates. We do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. The fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and for 2008 this fair market value would decrease by approximately $22.0 if interest rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $23.0 if interest rates were to decrease by 10%. For 2007, the fair market value of our debt would decrease by approximately $18.0 if interest rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $19.0 if interest rates were to decrease by 10%. We have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and variable rate debt obligations, but currently have none outstanding as we terminated our interest rate swap agreement on the 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes in September 2008.  

Foreign Currencies  

We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Since we report revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign operations. Based on 2008 exchange rates and operating results, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease between 3% and 5%. This assumes that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant from current levels. As the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency, our foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period presented for revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholdersÂ’ equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. However, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. Currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. We have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  

Credit and Market Risks  

Certain Balance Sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. We invest our excess cash in investment-grade, short-term securities with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Concentrations of credit risk with accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographical areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable.

As of December 31, 2008, we held $12.5 in par value of asset-backed auction rate securities. With the liquidity issues experienced in the credit and capital markets worldwide, the auctions have failed due to insufficient bids from buyers and as a result we adjusted these securities to a new book value of $6.7 during 2007. We believe we have the ability and currently intend to hold our auction rate securities until we can recover the full principal. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

As a result of the market decline in 2008, the fair value of our pension plan assets have declined by approximately 12% (excluding foreign currency impacts), resulting in higher pension expense and funding requirements in 2009, and, if unchanged, could result in higher pension expense and funding requirements in periods beyond 2009.
