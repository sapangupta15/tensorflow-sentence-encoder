ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our MD&A discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our financial statements are affected by our judgments, assumptions and estimates. The notes to our December 31, 2013 financial statements, primarily Note 2, summarize our significant accounting policies.   

 We believe the following are our critical accounting policies, because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  

 Income Tax Expense: We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules. We believe we have met these REIT requirements for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income.   

 Our evaluation that we have met the REIT requirements could be incorrect, because compliance with the tax rules requires factual determinations, and circumstances we have not identified could result in noncompliance with the tax requirements in current or prior years. For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years, we could be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income would be materially different from the amounts estimated in our financial statements.   

 In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as regular corporations. To the extent that amounts paid to us by our taxable REIT subsidiaries are determined by the taxing authorities to be in excess of amounts that would be paid under similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments. Such a penalty tax could have a material adverse impact on our net income.  

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. Others could come to materially different conclusions. In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment. Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.  

 Accrual for Uncertain and Contingent Liabilities: We accrue for certain contingent and other liabilities that have significant uncertain elements, such as property taxes, workers compensation claims, tenant reinsurance claims, as well as other legal claims and disputes involving customers, employees, governmental agencies and other third parties. Such liabilities we are aware of are estimated based upon many factors such as assumptions of past and future trends and our evaluation of likely outcomes. However, the estimates of known liabilities could be incorrect or we may not be aware of all such liabilities, in which case our accrued liabilities and net income could be misstated.   

 24  

Recording the fair value of acquired real estate facilities: In accounting for facilities acquired from third parties, we estimate the fair values of the land, buildings and intangible assets acquired. Such estimates are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including i) expected rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate assets, ii) estimated costs to replace acquired buildings and equipment in their current state, iii) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions, and iv) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base. Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.  

 MD&A Overview  

 Our domestic self-storage facilities generated 93% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, and also generated most of our net income and cash flow from operations. A significant portion of management time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities, as well as seeking additional investments in self-storage facilities.   

 Most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends. We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name “Public Storage,” and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively.   

 During 2013, we acquired 121 self-storage facilities for approximately $1.2 billion, substantially more than we had acquired in total in 2010, 2011 and 2012 (an aggregate of 77 facilities for $546 million). In 2013, we took advantage of a significant increase in properties being marketed for sale, which we believe was primarily driven by easier access to capital in the current low interest rate environment and improved property valuations. We expect to continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties. There is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional facilities at prices we will find attractive.   

 As of December 31 2013, we had development and expansion projects which will add approximately 1.8 million net rentable square feet of storage space at $196 million. We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

 We also have equity investments in Shurgard Europe and PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”). During the year ended December 31, 2013, we increased our ownership interest in PSB by acquiring 1,356,748 shares of PSB common stock in open-market transactions and directly from PSB, for an aggregate cost of $105.0 million. We may invest further in these entities in the future.   

 As of December 31, 2013, our capital commitments for 2014 exceed our expected capital resources. As of December 31, 2013, our capital resources consist of (i) approximately $250 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (ii) $216.2 million of cash proceeds from the sale of 51% of a loan we have provided to Shurgard Europe which we received in January 2014, and (iii) $250 million of expected 2014 retained operating cash flow. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected 2014 cash flow provided by operating activities, after deducting estimated 2014 distributions to our common and preferred shareholders, and estimated 2014 capital expenditure requirements.  

 At December 31, 2013, we had estimated 2014 capital commitments of $726.2 million of debt maturities, and approximately $145 million of remaining spend on our development pipeline. In addition, we expect that our capital commitments will continue to grow during 2014 as we continue to seek additional development and acquisition opportunities.  

 25  

We believe we have a variety of possibilities to bridge the gap between our capital resources and commitments which may include raising capital through the issuance of common or preferred securities, issuing debt, expanding the borrowing capacity of our credit facility, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information regarding our 2014 capital requirements.   

 Results of Operations   

 Operating results for 2013 as compared to 2012   

 For the year ended December 31, 2013, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $844.7 million or $4.89 per diluted common share, compared to $669.7 million or $3.90 per diluted common share for the same period in 2012, representing an increase of $175.0 million or $0.99 per diluted common share. This increase is due primarily to (i) a $124.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income, (ii) a $68.9 million reduction in income allocated to preferred shareholders due to redemptions, including our equity share of PSB, (iii) an $8.2 million increase from foreign currency exchange gains, offset partially by (iv) a $29.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization associated with acquired real estate facilities.   

 Operating results for 2012 as compared to 2011   

 For the year ended December 31, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $669.7 million or $3.90 per diluted common share, compared to $561.7 million or $3.29 per diluted common share for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of $108.0 million or $0.61 per diluted common share. This increase is due to (i) a $102.5 million increase in self-storage net operating income, (ii) a $19.6 million reduction in distributions to preferred shareholders due primarily to lower average coupon rates, and (iii) a $16.2 million increase resulting from foreign currency exchange gains and losses in translating our Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe into U.S. Dollars, offset partially by (iv) a $36.3 million decrease due to the application of EITF D-42 to our, and our equity share of PSB’s, redemptions of preferred securities.  

 Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations  

 Funds from Operations (“FFO”) is a non-GAAP term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses, and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets. We present FFO and FFO per share because we consider FFO to be an important measure of the performance of real estate companies, as do many analysts in evaluating our Company. We believe that FFO is a helpful measure of a REIT’s performance since FFO excludes depreciation, which is included in computing net income and assumes the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company. FFO and FFO per share is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income per share as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Because other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner, FFO may not be comparable among REITs.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2013, FFO was $7.53 per diluted common share, as compared to $6.31 for the same period in 2012, representing an increase of $1.22 per diluted common share.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2012, FFO was $6.31 per diluted common share, as compared to $5.67 for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of $0.64 per diluted common share.  

 The following table reconciles net income to FFO and FFO per diluted common share:  

 26  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In addition to FFO, we often discuss “Core FFO” per share which is also a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, representing gains of $17.1 million and $8.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a loss of $7.3 million for 2011, (ii) the impact of EITF D-42, including our equity share from PSB, representing charges totaling $68.9 million and $32.6 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively, (none for 2013) and (iii) other items. We believe Core FFO is a helpful measure in understanding our ongoing earnings and cash flow. We also believe that the analyst community, likewise, reviews our Core FFO and Core FFO per share (or similar measures using different terminology). Core FFO is not a substitute for net income, earnings per share or cash flow from operations. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Core FFO may not be comparable among REITs.   

 The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share:

 Real Estate Operations  

 Self-Storage Operations: Our self-storage operations represent 93% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our self-storage operations are analyzed in two groups: (i) the Same Store Facilities, representing the facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2011, and (ii) all other facilities, which are newly acquired, newly developed, or recently expanded facilities (the “Non Same Store Facilities”).   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (a)    See “Net Operating Income” below for further information regarding this non-GAAP measure. 

 Net income from our Self-Storage operations has increased 11.2% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 13.8% in 2012 as compared to 2011. These increases are due to improvements in our Same Store Facilities, as well as the acquisitions of new facilities and the fill-up of unstabilized facilities.  

 28  

 Same Store Facilities  

 The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2011 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2011, 2012 and 2013. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,949 facilities (122.8 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 88% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2013.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (c)   

 Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.   

 29  

   (d)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income. 

   (e)    Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our customers, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges, and administrative fees. 

 Analysis of Same Store Revenue  

 Revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 5.3% in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a 1.5% increase in average occupancy and a 3.8% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot. Revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 4.7% in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to a 0.7% increase in average occupancy and a 4.2% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot. The increase in realized rent per occupied square foot in both periods was due primarily to annual rent increases given to customers that have been renting with us longer than one year, and to a lesser extent, reduced promotional discounts given to new customers.   

 Same Store average occupancy increased from 91.3% in 2011, to 91.9% in 2012, and to 93.3% in 2013, representing increases of 0.7% in 2012 and 1.5% in 2013. The year over year increases began primarily late in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we implemented more aggressive pricing strategies in the seasonally slow first and fourth quarters. The occupancy spread narrowed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and is expected to continue to narrow in 2014, due to more difficult comparisons.   

 Our future rental growth will be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including demand for self-storage space, the level of competitor supply of self-storage space, our ability to increase rental rates to new and existing customers, the level of promotional activities required, and the average length of stay of our customers.   

 Increasing rental rates to existing customers, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. We expect to pass similar rent increases to long-term customers in 2014, as we did in 2013.   

 We believe that high occupancies help maximize our rental revenue. We seek to maintain an average occupancy level of at least 90%, by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new customers as well as adjusting our marketing efforts on both television and the Internet in order to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace customers that vacate. Demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand is higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new customers are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months.   

 During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the average annualized contractual rates per occupied square foot for customers that moved in were $12.97, $12.76 and $12.89, respectively, and for customers that vacated were $13.76, $13.54 and $13.24, respectively. Promotional discounts, generally representing a one-month reduction in contractual rents, given in the first month of tenancy, were $79.3 million, $87.9 million and $96.6 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Promotional discounts have declined due to higher occupancies.   

 We believe that the current trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents and occupancy levels are consistent with our expectation of continued revenue growth in 2014. However, such trends, when viewed in the short-run, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they are subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include initial move-in rates, seasonal   

 30  

factors, the unit size and geographical mix of the specific customers moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the customers moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing customers.  

 Analysis of Same Store Cost of Operations   

 Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 1.3% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and decreased 2.2% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in 2013 was due primarily to reduced advertising and selling expense, offset partially by increased property taxes. The decrease in 2012 was due to reduced repairs and maintenance, advertising and selling expense, and on-site property manager payroll, offset partially by increased property taxes.   

 Property tax expense increased 5.1% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and increased 3.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The increase in 2013 was due primarily to higher assessed values and tax rates, while the increase in 2012 was due primarily to higher assessed values. We expect property tax growth of approximately 4.5% to 5% in 2014.  

 On-site property manager payroll expense decreased 0.8% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 3.1% in 2012 as compared to 2011. These decreases were due to reductions in incentive compensation, offset partially in 2013 by higher claims expense with respect to employee health benefits. We expect on-site property manager payroll expense to increase modestly in 2014 due to higher health care costs.   

 Supervisory payroll expense, which represents compensation paid to the management personnel who directly and indirectly supervise the on-site property managers, increased 1.4% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and increased 3.5% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The increase in 2013 was due primarily to increases in compensation rates, while the increase in 2012 was due primarily to increased headcount.  We expect inflationary increases in compensation rates and flat headcount in 2014.  

 Repairs and maintenance expense decreased 1.7% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and decreased 11.7% in 2012 as compared to 2011. Repair and maintenance costs include snow removal expense totaling $5.3 million, $2.7 million and $4.3 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding snow removal costs, repairs and maintenance decreased 8.7% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 9.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011.   

 Repairs and maintenance expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact repair and maintenance needs, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events. We expect inflationary increases in repairs and maintenance expense in 2014 excluding snow removal expense. Snow removal expense is expected to be higher in the three months ending March 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 due to high levels of snowfall.  

 Our utility expenses are comprised primarily of electricity costs, which are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature.  Utility expense was flat in 2013 as compared to 2012 and down 4.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in 2012 was due to reduced usage caused by milder weather. It is difficult to estimate future utility cost levels, because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and not predictable. We do, however, expect utility expense to be higher in the first three months of 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 due to severe winter weather in many of the markets we operate in.   

 Advertising and selling expense is comprised principally of Internet advertising, media advertising and the operating costs of our telephone reservation center. Advertising and selling expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors; media and Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short run in response to these factors. These costs declined 30.3% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and declined 9.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in 2013 is due to the phase-out of our yellow page advertising program as of December 31, 2012, as well as reduced television advertising and Internet search costs as a result of high occupancies. The decrease in 2012 is   

 31  

due primarily to reduced media advertising. Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies, we expect advertising and selling expense to be approximately flat in 2014.  

 Other direct property costs include administrative expenses incurred at the self-storage facilities, such as property insurance, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the properties’ cash receipts, credit card fees, and the cost of operating each property’s rental office including supplies and telephone data communication lines. These costs decreased 2.0% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 6.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in 2013 is due to lower property insurance costs and certain administrative cost-saving efforts, offset partially by an increase in credit card fees due primarily to an increase in credit card collections. The decrease in 2012 is due principally to lower credit card fee rates. We expect moderate increases in other direct property costs in 2014.   

 Allocated overhead represents administrative expenses for shared general corporate functions, which are allocated to self-storage property operations to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations. Such functions include data processing, human resources, operational accounting and finance, marketing, and costs of senior executives (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are included in general and administrative expense). Allocated overhead decreased 1.5% in 2013 as compared to 2012, and increased 1.9% in 2012 as compared to 2011. We expect inflationary growth in allocated overhead in 2014 as compared to the 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 34  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 35  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows. It is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results. Over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics.   

 Non Same Store Facilities  

 The Non Same Store Facilities at December 31, 2013 represent 238 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since January 1, 2011, or that we did not own as of January 1, 2011. As a result of the stabilization process and timing of when the facilities were acquired, year-over-year changes can be significant. In the following table, “Other facilities” includes all facilities that we have owned, but were not yet stabilized as of January 1, 2011, three facilities that we obtained control of and began consolidating in 2012 and a newly developed facility opened in 2013.  

 The following table summarizes operating data with respect to the Non Same Store Facilities:

(a)See “Net Operating Income” below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our net income in our statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

 During 2013, we acquired 121 operating self-storage facilities from third parties (8,036,000 net rentable square feet of storage space) for approximately $1.16 billion. During 2012, we acquired 24 operating self-storage facilities from third parties (1,908,000 net rentable square feet of storage space and unfinished space that was converted to 209,000 net rentable square feet of self-storage space in 2013 for $20.3 million in additional development cost) for $225.5 million in cash. During 2011, we acquired eleven operating self-storage facilities from third parties (896,000 net rentable square feet) for an aggregate cost of $80.4 million.   

 For 2013, the weighted average annualized yield for the facilities acquired in 2011 and 2012 (excluding the facility that was acquired in 2012 and expanded in 2013) was 10.5% and 6.8%, respectively. The weighted average annualized yield with respect to the 2013 acquisitions is not meaningful due to our limited ownership period.  

 During 2013, we completed expansions to the Other Facilities, adding 300,000 net rentable square feet of self-storage space, for an aggregate cost of $19.9 million and we opened a newly developed facility for an aggregate cost of $16.6 million with 105,000 net rentable square feet of storage space.   

 We expect to increase the number of Non Same Storage Facilities over at least the next twelve months through development of additional self-storage space and acquisitions of existing facilities from third parties. As of December 31, 2013, we had development and expansion projects which will add approximately 1.8 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $196 million. A total of $52 million in costs were incurred through December 31, 2013, with the remaining costs expected to be incurred in 2014. Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities. There is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional facilities at prices we will find attractive.   

 We believe that our management and operating infrastructure will result in newly acquired facilities stabilizing at a higher level of net operating income than was achieved by the previous owners. However, it can take 24 or more months for these newly acquired facilities to reach stabilization, and the ultimate levels of net operating income to be achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions. As a result, there can be no assurance that our expectations with respect to these facilities will be achieved. However, we expect the Non Same Store Facilities to continue to provide earnings growth during 2014 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels and the earnings of the 2013 acquisitions are reflected in our operations for a longer period in 2014 as compared to 2013.   

 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities  

 At December 31, 2013, we have equity investments in PSB, Shurgard Europe and various limited partnerships. We account for such investments using the equity method.   

 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities for 2013, 2012 and 2011 consists of our pro-rata share of the net income of these unconsolidated real estate entities for each period. The following table sets forth the significant components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities.  

 38  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Investment in PSB: At December 31, 2013, we have an approximate 42% common equity interest in PSB, comprised of our ownership of 7,158,354 shares of PSB’s common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in an operating partnership controlled by PSB (41% as of December 31, 2012, comprised of our ownership of 5,801,606 shares of PSB’s common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units at December 31, 2012).  The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into PSB common stock.   

 During 2013, we purchased 406,748 shares of PSB common stock in open-market transactions at an average cost of $73.15 per share.  

 On November 7, 2013, we purchased 950,000 shares of PSB common stock from PSB at $79.25 per share, concurrent with PSB’s sale of 1,495,000 additional shares to the public at the same price per share.   

 At December 31, 2013, PSB owned and operated 29.7 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in eight states. PSB also manages commercial space that we own pursuant to property management agreements.  

 Equity in earnings from PSB increased to $23.2 million in 2013 from $10.6 million in 2012. This increase was due primarily to EITF D-42 charges from PSB’s redemptions of preferred securities recorded in 2012, combined with increases in operating income for its newly acquired and same-park facilities. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for selected financial information on PSB, as well as PSB’s filings and selected financial information that can be accessed through the SEC, and on PSB’s website, www.psbusinessparks.com.  

 Equity in earnings from PSB decreased to $10.6 million in 2012, as compared to $27.8 million in 2011. This decrease was principally due to (i) the impact of PSB’s redemptions of preferred securities in 2011 and 2012, which reduced income allocated to the common equity holders in 2012, and increased income allocable to the common equity holders in 2011, (ii) increased depreciation and interest expense as a result of the properties PSB acquired in 2011 and 2012, partially offset by (iii) incremental income generated by the properties PSB acquired in 2011 and 2012.   

 Our investment in PSB provides us with some diversification.   

 Investment in Shurgard Europe: Equity in earnings of Shurgard Europe represents our 49% equity share of Shurgard Europe’s net income. At December 31, 2013, Shurgard Europe’s operations are comprised of 187 wholly-owned facilities with 10 million net rentable square feet. Selected financial data for Shurgard Europe for 2013, 2012 and 2011 is included in Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements. As described in more detail in Note 4, we receive interest income and trademark license fees from Shurgard Europe.   

 Equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe decreased to $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $33.2 million for the same period in 2012.   

 39  

Equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe increased to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $29.2 million for the same period in 2011. The increase is due to our equity share of (i) improved property operations, (ii) reduced interest expense due to a reduction in interest rates and repayment of principal on third-party debt (iii) the impact of Shurgard Europe’s March 2, 2011 acquisition of the remaining 80% interest it did not own in two joint ventures that owned 72 self-storage facilities, partially offset by (iv) a reduction in foreign currency exchange rates when converting Euros into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes.   

 Shurgard Europe has no development pipeline and no expectations in the short-term of acquiring any facilities from third parties. Accordingly, at least in the short-term, our future earnings from Shurgard Europe will be affected primarily by the operating results of its existing facilities, as well as the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and currencies in the countries Shurgard Europe conducts its business, principally the Euro.   

 European Same Store Facilities: The Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool represents the 163 facilities (8.7 million net rentable square feet, representing 86% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of Shurgard Europe’s self-storage portfolio) that have been consolidated and operated by Shurgard Europe on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2011 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2011, 2012 and 2013. We evaluate the performance of these facilities because Shurgard Europe’s ability to effectively manage stabilized facilities represents an important measure of its ability to grow its earnings over the long-term.   

 The following table reflects 100% of the operating results of those 163 facilities. We restate the exchange rates used in prior year’s presentation to the actual exchange rates for 2013. However, only our pro rata share of the operating results for these facilities, based upon the actual exchange rates for each period, is included in “equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities” on our statements of income.   

 In Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements, we disclose Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results include 24 additional facilities that are not Same Store Facilities, and are based upon historical exchange rates rather than constant exchange rates for each of the respective periods.  

 40  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)In order to isolate changes in the underlying operations from the impact of exchange rates, the amounts in this table are presented on a constant exchange rate basis. The amounts for years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 have been restated using the actual exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2013.   

 (b)We present Shurgard Europe’s same-store net operating income or “NOI,” which is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, in evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating Shurgard Europe’s operating results.   

 (c)Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.  

 (d)Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.  

 Net operating income decreased 3.4% in 2013 as compared to 2012, principally due to a reduction in revenue of 1.9% and relatively flat cost of operations. Net operating income increased 1.6% in 2012 as compared to 2011, due to decreases in expenses offset by lower revenues. While revenue declined in 2013, the most recent trends in the fourth quarter of 2013 have improved. Due to the limited number of facilities in this portfolio and lack of geographic diversification, as well as recent volatile economic conditions in   

 41  

Western Europe, it is difficult to estimate revenue growth. However, based upon current trends, it appears that revenue should increase modestly in at least the first quarter of 2014.   

 See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Shurgard Europe” for additional information on Shurgard Europe’s liquidity.  

 Other Investments: The “Other Investments” at December 31, 2013 are comprised primarily of our equity in earnings from various limited partnerships that own an aggregate of 14 self-storage facilities (792,000 net rentable square feet). Our future earnings with respect to the Other Investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the facilities these entities own. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements under the “Other Investments” for certain condensed combined financial information of these entities.  

 Ancillary Operations  

 Ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with (i) the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by customers in our self-storage facilities in the U.S., (ii) merchandise sales, (iii) commercial property operations and (iv) management of 42 facilities owned by third parties and the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.   

 Commercial property operations are included in our commercial segment and all other ancillary revenues and costs of operations are not allocated to any segment. See Note 11 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for further information regarding our segments and for a reconciliation of these ancillary revenues and cost of operations to our net income.   

 The following table sets forth our ancillary operations as presented on our income statements:  

 42  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Tenant reinsurance operations: We reinsure policies offered through a non-affiliated insurance company against losses to goods stored by customers in the domestic self-storage facilities we operate. The level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon the level of premiums charged for such insurance and the number of customers that participate in the insurance program. Cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses. These costs are dependent primarily upon the level of losses incurred, including the level of catastrophic events that occur and affect our properties thereby increasing tenant insurance claims.   

 The increase in tenant insurance revenues in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the respective prior years is due to (i) an increased number of customers due to higher occupancy levels, including the fill-up of non-Same Store facilities, (ii) an increase in the percentage of such customers having policies from 61% in 2011, to 63% in 2012 and 65% in 2013, (iii) an increase in average premium rates and (iv) the impact of the acquisition of 145 self-storage facilities from third parties in 2012 and 2013. Tenant insurance revenues with respect to customers in our Same Store Facilities totaled $76.5 million, $71.4 million and $66.0 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   

 We expect continued increases in tenant insurance revenues in 2014 as the tenant insurance revenues with respect to the facilities we acquired in 2013 are reflected for a full year and Non-Same Store facilities continue to add customers. We expect stable participation rates and flat premium rates in 2014.   

 Commercial operations: We also own and operate commercial facilities, primarily the leasing of small retail storefronts and office space located on or near our existing self-storage facilities. We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our commercial operations.   

 Merchandise sales and other: We sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities, and the level of sales of these items is primarily impacted by the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities. These amounts include, to a much lesser extent, the results of our management of 42 self-storage facilities in the U.S. for third party owners and other partnerships that we account for on the equity method. In 2012 our merchandise sales and margins improved primarily as a   

 43  

result of higher retail prices for our locks. We do not expect any significant changes in revenues our profitability from our merchandise sales and other in 2014.  

 Other Income and Expense Items  

 Interest and other income: Interest and other income was $22.6 million in 2013, $22.1 million in 2012 and $32.3 million in 2011, respectively. Interest and other income primarily includes interest income on loans receivable from Shurgard Europe, as well as trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe for the use of the “Shurgard” trade name. We record 51% of the aggregate interest income and trademark license fees as interest and other income, while the remaining 49% is presented as additional equity in earnings on our income statement.   

 Aggregate interest income and trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe was $20.6 million, $20.0 million and $26.7 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   

 The loan receivable from Shurgard Europe (the “Shareholder Loan”) is denominated in Euros and has a balance of €311.0 million ($428.1 million) as of December 31, 2013. On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019. As a result, the 51% of the interest received on the Shareholder Loan that we previously recorded as interest income will cease as of January 28, 2014. We will continue to record interest received with respect to our remaining 49% ownership of the Shareholder Loan as additional equity in earnings on our income statement.   

 The terms of a loan payable by Shurgard Europe to a bank (the “Bank Loan”), with a principal amount of €107.5 million at December 31, 2013, requires significant principal repayments through the maturity date in November 2014. As a result, in 2013 and 2012 there were no principal repayments on the Shareholder Loan. All interest on the Shareholder Loan has been paid currently when due and we expect the interest to continue to be paid when due with Shurgard Europe’s operating cash flow.   

 The remainder of our interest and other income is comprised primarily of interest earned on cash balances as well as sundry other income items that are received from time to time in varying amounts. Interest income on cash balances has been minimal, because rates have been at historic lows of 0.1% or less, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Future earnings from sundry other income items are not predictable.   

 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization increased to $387.4 million for 2013 as compared to $357.8 million for 2012 and $358.0 million for 2011, due principally to newly acquired facilities. Included in depreciation and amortization is amortization expense of tenant intangibles for facilities acquired from third parties, which is being amortized relative to the expected future benefit of the customers in place for each period. Such amortization expense totaled $24.1 million, $10.5 million and $11.9 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Based upon the facilities we own at December 31, 2013, amortization expense with respect to such intangibles is estimated at $36.6 million in 2014. The level of future depreciation and amortization will primarily depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities and the level of capital expenditures we incur on our facilities.   

 General and administrative expense: The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense:   

 44  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Share-based compensation expense includes the amortization of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and stock options granted to employees, as well as employer taxes incurred upon vesting of RSUs and upon exercise of employee stock options. The level of share-based compensation expense varies based upon the level of grants and forfeitures. The increase in share-based compensation costs in 2013 as compared to 2012 is due primarily to additional share-based grants. The increase in share-based compensation costs in 2012 as compared to 2011 is due primarily to additional share-based grants, offset partially by a reduction of $5.5 million with respect to certain RSUs granted in 2011 under a performance-based plan. We expect share-based compensation expense to remain flat in 2014 as compared to 2013. See Note 10 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for further information on our share-based compensation.   

 Costs of senior executives represent the cash compensation paid to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. The increases in 2013 as compared to 2012 and in 2012 as compared to 2011 are due to increases in incentive compensation.   

 Development and acquisition costs represent internal and external expenses related to our acquisition and development activities and varies primarily based upon the level of development and acquisition activities undertaken. Incremental legal, transfer tax, and other related costs of approximately $5.0 million, $1.8 million and $0.8 million were incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate facilities in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The level of such costs to be incurred in 2014 will depend upon the level of acquisition activities, which is not determinable.  

 Tax compliance costs and taxes paid include taxes paid to various state and local authorities, the internal and external costs of filing tax returns, costs associated with complying with federal and state tax laws, and maintaining our compliance with Internal Revenue Service REIT rules. Such costs vary primarily based upon the tax rates of the various states in which we do business.   

 Legal costs include internal personnel as well as fees paid to legal firms and other third parties with respect to general corporate legal matters and risk management, and varies based upon the level of litigation.   

 Public company costs represent the incremental costs of operating as a publicly-traded company, such as internal and external investor relations expenses, stock listing and transfer agent fees, board of directors’ costs, and costs associated with maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   

 Our future general and administrative expenses are difficult to estimate, due to their dependence upon many factors, including those noted above.   

 Interest expense: Interest expense was $6.4 million, $19.8 million and $24.2 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

 45  

The decreases in 2013 as compared to 2012, and 2012 as compared to 2011, are due primarily to repayments on our unsecured senior notes in 2013 and 2011, along with principal repayments on our secured mortgage debt. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we capitalized interest of $2.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, associated with our development activities. See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for a schedule of our notes payable balances, principal repayment requirements and average interest rates. The level of interest expense that we incur in 2014 will be dependent upon the source of funds used to refinance our term loan that matures on December 2, 2014, and when such refinance is expected to occur.   

 Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss): We recorded foreign currency translation gains of $17.1 million and $8.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a loss $7.3 million in 2011, representing primarily the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-based Shareholder Loan due to fluctuations in exchange rates. We have not entered into any agreements to mitigate the impact of currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, therefore the amount of U.S. Dollars we will receive on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at that time. We record the exchange gains or losses into net income each period because of our continued expectation of repayment of the Shareholder Loan in the foreseeable future. The U.S. Dollar exchange rate relative to the Euro was approximately 1.377, 1.322 and 1.295 at December 31, 2013, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.   

 Future foreign exchange gains or losses will be dependent primarily upon the movement of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, the amount of the Shareholder Loan and our continued expectation of collecting the principal on the loan in the foreseeable future. As noted above, On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019.   

 Net Income Allocable to Preferred Shareholders: Allocations of net income to our preferred shareholders generally consists of allocations (i) based on distributions and (ii) in applying EITF D-42 when we redeem preferred shares. During 2012 and 2011, we redeemed certain existing series of preferred shares and issued additional preferred shares at lower coupon rates. Net income allocable to preferred shareholders in applying EITF D-42 totaled $61.7 million and $35.6 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, (there were no redemptions of preferred securities and as a result, no EITF D-42 allocations in 2013). Net income allocable to preferred shareholders associated with distributions decreased during 2013 as compared to 2012, and 2012 as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower average dividend rates and lower average outstanding preferred shares. Based upon our preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2013, our quarterly distribution to our preferred shareholders is expected to be approximately $51.9 million.   

 Net Operating Income   

 In our discussions above, we refer to net operating income or “NOI,” which is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, in evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. The following table reconciles NOI generated by our self-storage facilities to our operating income:  

 46  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 47  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Financial Strategy: Our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt-to-total-capitalization. In general, we seek to finance our investment activities and debt obligations with retained operating cash flow, and when not sufficient, capital raised through the issuance of preferred and common securities. When market conditions are not favorable to issue either preferred or common securities, we will use bank debt as bridge financing.   

 Unlike most REITs, we have elected to use predominantly preferred securities in our capital structure as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt. We have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons: (i) under the REIT structure, a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders, making it difficult, relative to a traditional taxable corporation, to repay debt with operating cash flow alone, (ii) our perpetual preferred shares have no sinking fund requirement or maturity date and do not require redemption, all of which eliminate future refinancing risks, (iii) after the end of a non-call period, we have the option to redeem the preferred shares at any time, which enables us to refinance higher coupon preferred shares with new preferred shares at lower rates if appropriate, (iv) preferred shares do not contain covenants, thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility, and (v) dividends on the preferred shares can be applied to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.   

 We have generally been able to raise preferred capital at an attractive cost relative to the issuance of our common shares, and as a result, our issuances of common shares for cash have been minimal over the past several years. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we issued approximately $725.0 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, of preferred securities. Currently, market conditions are much less favorable, with market coupon rates for our most recently issued series of preferred securities trading at approximately 6.5% (as compared to 5.2% for the preferred securities we issued in the first quarter of 2013). We believe that market coupon rates for a new issuance of our preferred securities would need to be in the area of 6.5% and the amount of capital we could raise would most likely be much lower than what we raised in the first quarter of 2013. The market coupon rate on our preferred securities is influenced by long-term interest rates.   

 Due to poor capital market conditions for the issuance of either preferred or common securities, during the last three months of 2013, we borrowed approximately $750.1 million from banks to bridge finance our acquisition activities during that timeframe. See discussion on this debt below.  

  Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “A3” by Moody’s, “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A” by Fitch Ratings. In recent years, we have been one of the largest and most frequent issuers of preferred equity in the U.S.   

 Liquidity and Capital Resource Analysis: We believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for operating expenses, capital improvements and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.   

 As of December 31, 2013, our capital commitments for 2014 exceed our expected capital resources. As of December 31, 2013, our capital resources consist of (i) approximately $250 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (ii) $216.2 million of cash proceeds from the sale of 51% of a loan we have provided to Shurgard Europe which we received in January 2014, and (iii) $250 million of expected 2014 retained operating cash flow. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected 2014 cash flow provided by operating activities, after deducting estimated 2014 distributions to our common and preferred shareholders, and estimated 2014 capital expenditure requirements.  

 At December 31, 2013, we had estimated 2014 capital commitments of $726.2 million of debt maturities, and approximately $145 million of remaining spend on our development pipeline. In addition, we expect that our capital commitments will continue to grow during 2014 as we continue to seek additional development and acquisition opportunities.  

 48  

We believe we have a variety of possibilities to bridge the gap between our capital resources and commitments which may include raising capital through the issuance of common or preferred securities, issuing debt, expanding the borrowing capacity of our credit facility, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.  

 At February 25, 2014, we have no outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and outstanding borrowings of $600 million on our term loan.   

 Debt Service Requirements: As of December 31, 2013, our outstanding debt totaled approximately $839.1 million. Approximate principal maturities of our outstanding debt are as follows (amounts in thousands):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The remaining maturities on our secured debt are nominal compared to our annual cash from operations. We intend to repay the secure debt at maturity and not seek to refinance it with additional debt.   

 Virtually all of the book value of our real estate facilities are unencumbered at December 31, 2013.  

 Capital Expenditure Requirements: Capital expenditures include major repairs or replacements to elements of our facilities, which keep the facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal to the customer, which totaled $71.3 million in 2013. Capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or the expansion of net rentable square footage of existing facilities. During 2014, we expect to incur approximately $70 million for capital expenditures and fund such amounts with cash provided by operating activities. For the last four years, such capital expenditures have ranged between approximately $0.55 and $0.60 per net rentable square foot per year.  

 Requirement to Pay Distributions: For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.   

 Distributions paid during 2013 totaled $1.1 billion, consisting of $204.3 million to preferred shareholders and $887.1 million to common shareholders and restricted share unitholders. All of these distributions were REIT qualifying distributions.  

 We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2013 to be approximately $207.6 million per year.   

 On February 20, 2014, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $1.40 per common share. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash provided by operating activities.   

 49  

We are obligated to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries based upon the cash provided by operating activities of the respective subsidiary. Such distributions are estimated at approximately $6.4 million in 2014, with respect to such noncontrolling interests outstanding at December 31, 2013.   

 Real Estate Investment Activities:  As of February 25, 2014, we were under contract to acquire a self-storage facility for approximately $10.8 million in cash. During 2014, we will continue to seek to acquire self-storage facilities from third parties; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake.   

 As of December 31, 2013, we had development and expansion projects which will add approximately 1.8 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $196 million. A total of $52 million in costs were incurred through December 31, 2013, with the remaining costs expected to be incurred primarily in 2014. Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites for building that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as the challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.  

 Shurgard Europe: Shurgard Europe has a term loan from a bank (the “Bank Loan”) with a balance of approximately €107.5 million ($148.0 million) at December 31, 2013 maturing in November 2014 and the Shareholder Loan totaling €311.0 million ($428.1 million) at December 31, 2013. On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash, and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019. Shurgard Europe is exploring various financing alternatives.  

 Redemption of Preferred Securities: We have no series of preferred shares that are redeemable before April 2015 and none of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.   

 Repurchases of Company’s Common Shares: Our Board of Trustees has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2013, we did not repurchase any of our common shares. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 25, 2014, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. We have no current plans to repurchase shares; however, future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.   

 50  

 Contractual Obligations   

 Our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending December 31 (amounts in thousands):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)Amounts include principal and interest payments (all of which are fixed-rate) on our notes payable based on their contractual terms. See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for additional information on our notes payable.   

 (2)Amounts represent borrowings under our $700 million term loan, of which $100 million was repaid on January 30, 2014. See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for additional information on our term loan.  

 (3)Amounts represent borrowings under our $300 million revolving line of credit, which were repaid on January 8, 2014. See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for additional information on our line of credit.  

 (4)We lease land, equipment and office space under various operating leases. Certain leases are cancelable; however, significant penalties would be incurred upon cancellation. Amounts reflected above consider continuance of the lease without cancellation.   

 (5) Amounts exclude an additional $100.6 million in future expected development spending that was not under contract at December 31, 2013.  

 We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2013, to be approximately $207.6 million per year. Dividends are paid when and if declared by our Board of Trustees and accumulate if not paid. We have no series of preferred shares that are redeemable before April 2015 and none of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.   

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: At December 31, 2013, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under Regulation S-K 303(a)(4) and the instructions thereto.
