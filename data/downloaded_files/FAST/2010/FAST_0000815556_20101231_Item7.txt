BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW:  

Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2,500 company owned stores. Most of our customers are in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and maintenance and repair operations (MRO). The non-residential construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. Other users of our product include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our stores and customers are primarily located in North America.  

Like most industrial and construction centric organizations, we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years. The third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices (approximately 50% of our sales consist of some type of fastener  nuts, bolts, screws, etc.  most of which are made of steel) and energy prices (a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across North America in one of our over 5,000 vehicles on the road).  

In the fourth quarter of 2008, and throughout much of 2009, this inflation turned to deflation. When the swings are dramatic, this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices. This hurt our gross margins in 2009. The drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief, but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation. The deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to partially recover in 2010. (See later discussion on gross margins.)  

The discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2010. This information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year. However, we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes, sequential trends, and end market information that follow  they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty.  

As always, the pathway to profit is the cornerstone of our business evolution, and it influences everything we do. Remember, our business centers on our 2,500 stores  their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time. As you read the balance of this discussion you will see our stores were able to make great strides in their endeavor to dig out of the economic hole known as 2009. We will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of Growth through Customer Service.  

SALES GROWTH:  

Net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in net sales in 2010 came primarily from higher unit sales. Our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services. The higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document) and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years. The growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment, an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008. The increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the Canadian currency relative to the United States dollar and from our Holo-Krome business, which we acquired in December 2009. These two items added approximately 0.7 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, to our growth in 2010.  

The decrease in net sales in 2009 came primarily from lower unit sales, the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes, particularly in our steel based products. Our sales change in 2009 was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services. The lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document); this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years. The decrease in sales at older store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in 2008 and the first part of 2009.

The impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago (store sites opened as follows: 2010 group  opened 2000 and earlier, 2009 group  opened 1999 and earlier, and 2008 group  opened 1998 and earlier) and opened greater than five years ago (store sites opened as follows: 2010 group  opened 2005 and earlier, 2009 group  opened 2004 and earlier, and 2008 group  opened 2003 and earlier). These two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. The stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent same store view of our business (store sites opened as follows: 2010 group  opened 2008 and earlier, 2009 group  opened 2007 and earlier, and 2008 group  opened 2006 and earlier). The daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: The age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year.  

Stores opened in 2010 contributed approximately $22,040 (or 1.0%) to 2010 net sales. Stores opened in 2009 contributed approximately $52,737 (or 2.3%) to 2010 net sales and approximately $15,172 (or 0.8%) to 2009 net sales. The rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years, and, as stated earlier, the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores.  

SALES BY PRODUCT LINE:  

The approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows:

COMMENTS REGARDING MONTHLY SALES CHANGES, SEQUENTIAL TRENDS, AND END MARKET PERFORMANCE  

Note  Daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period.  

This section focuses on three distinct views of our business  monthly sales changes, sequential trends, and end market performance. The discussion of monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores. The discussion of sales trends provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends (that is, comparing a period to the immediately preceding period) in our business since the market deteriorated late in 2008. Finally, we believe the discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.  

MONTHLY SALES CHANGES:  

Stores opened greater than five years  The impact of the economy, over time, is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years (store sites opened as follows: 2010 group  opened 2005 and earlier, 2009 group  opened 2004 and earlier, and 2008 group  opened 2003 and earlier). This store group is more cyclical due to the increased market share these stores enjoy in their local markets. During each of the twelve months in 2010, 2009, and 2008, the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):

Stores opened greater than two years  Our stores opened greater than two years (store sites opened as follows: 2010 group  opened 2008 and earlier, 2009 group  opened 2007 and earlier, and 2008 group  opened 2006 and earlier) represent a consistent same-store view of our business. During each of the twelve months in 2010, 2009, and 2008, the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

All company sales  During each of the twelve months in 2010, 2009, and 2008, all of our selling locations combined had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The improvement in 2010 generally continues the trend we saw in the latter half of 2009. The slow-down in the final three months of 2008 and all of 2009 relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace.  

Several additional factors positively impacted our sales growth in 2010: (1) the strengthening Canadian dollar (when compared to the United States dollar) added approximately 0.7 percentage points to our daily sales growth and (2) our Holo-Krome business, which we acquired in December 2009, added approximately 0.5 percentage points to our daily sales growth.  

SEQUENTIAL TRENDS:  

We find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway  This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.  

History has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months with impaired business days (certain holidays). The first landing centers on Easter, which alternates between March and April (Easter occurred in April in both 2009 and 2010), the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the Christmas / New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.

Table of Contents 

The table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled Past is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003. We chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics, a weaker industrial economy in North America, and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line. The 2009 and 2010 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The 09Delta line is the difference between the Past and 2009; similarly, the 10Delta is the difference between the Past and 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.  

The 18.3% drop from October 2008 to January 2009 represents the immediate impact of the economy on our business. During this time frame, our daily sales change, on a year-over-year basis, dropped from 11.9% growth in October to a contraction of 8.5% in January. After January, the trend continued downward as the Delta (or spread between the benchmark and the 2009 actual) in February, March, and April 2009 averaged a negative 4.9%. The daily sales contraction, on a year-over-year basis, was 21.0% in April. The Delta from May 2009 to July 2009 was not as significant, averaging a negative 1.0%. While this period was still painful, it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the drop. Finally, in the period from August 2009 to December 2009, the Delta improved, and averaged a positive 0.7%. During 2010, sales have been strong - our business exceeded the trend line in January, whereas February took a step back due to inclement weather, and March reestablished the trend of being at or above the trend line (see graph below).  

A graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above, starting with a base of 100 in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows:  

END MARKET PERFORMANCE:  

Fluctuations in end market business The sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. To place this in perspective  approximately 50% of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing. The daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (when compared to the same quarter in the previous year), and for the year, as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2010 growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business (this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers) and less pronounced in the maintenance

Table of Contents 

 portion of our manufacturing business (this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing). The 2009 contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business.  

Our non-residential construction customers have historically represented 20% to 25% of our business. The daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (when compared to the same quarter in the previous year), and for the year, as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On a sequential basis, the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in May 2009 and then started to demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms. This reversed the negative trend which began in October 2008. This stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our non-residential construction business which weakened dramatically in the first eight months of 2009, and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms.  

A graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2008, 2009, and 2010, starting with a base of 100 in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows:

PATHWAY TO PROFIT AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS:  

During April 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business  For most of the preceding ten years, we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business (our historical rate was approximately 14% new stores each year). As announced in April 2007, we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns. We funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7% to 10% per year (see our disclosure below regarding the temporary slowing of our store growth in 2009 and 2010). Our goal was four-fold: (1) to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model, (2) to grow the sales of our average store to $125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012, (3) to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow, resulting in a growth of our pre-tax earnings to 23% of net sales by 2012, and (4) to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital (primarily inventory) as our average sales volume per store increases. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the pathway to profit beginning in 2009. These changes centered on two aspects (1) temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of 2% to 5% per year, and (2) temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing. (See later discussion on future store openings.)  

One side benefit of the pathway to profit initiative, described above, is a slow altering of our cost structure over the last several years to increase the portion of our operating costs that are variable versus fixed. This dramatically improved our ability to manage through the economic environment of the last two years. As discussed in our third quarter 2009 earnings release, we began to stabilize our store headcount in October 2009. From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010 we grew our store average full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount from 7,007 to 7,611, or 8.6%. (See later discussion on store count and FTE numbers by quarter.)  

The pathway to profit initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business: (1) store headcount, (2) store (or unit) growth, and (3) average sales volume per store, which ultimately drive our level of profitability. Our original goal was to hit the $125 thousand per month store average, and grow our pre-tax earnings to 23% of net sales by 2012. We previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by 24-30 months. However, as described below, we have now modified our thinking regarding our pre-tax earnings goals.  

During 2010, we modified our thought process around the pathway to profit in two regards: (1) we have structurally lowered our cost structure and believe we can hit our profitability target in the pathway to profit initiative with average store sales of $100 - $110 thousand per month by 2013 (see evidence of this in our Store Size and Profitability table later in this document) and (2) we decided to hire fewer store-based people and instead added resources focused on specific opportunities, such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists (manufacturing, government, industry focused, and automated solutions).  

Future store openings  In July 2010, we indicated our intentions to open 80 to 95 new stores during the second half of 2010 (or an annualized rate of 6.8% to 8.0%). During the second half of 2010 we opened 82 stores. In 2011, we intend to open 150 to 200 new stores, or an annualized rate of 6.0% to 8.0%.

Table of Contents 

Store Count and Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Headcount  Because of our pathway to profit, we increased both our store count (opening 7.5% and 8.1% new stores in calendar 2008 and 2007, respectively) and our store FTE headcount in 2007 and 2008. However, the rate of increase in store locations slowed (we opened 5.4% and 3.0% new stores in calendar 2010 and 2009, respectively) and our FTE headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008. The number of stores at quarter end, the average headcount at our stores per quarter, the average FTE headcount per quarter, and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 (the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit), for the third quarter of 2008 (our peak quarter before the economy weakened), and for each of the last five quarters:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1  Note  The distribution and manufacturing headcount was impacted by the addition of 92 employees with the acquisition of Holo-Krome in December 2009.  

We have reduced our average FTE headcount at our store locations 8.1% since our peak of 8,280 average FTE headcount in the third quarter of 2008, much of this decrease relates to a reduction in part-time hours worked as our average absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel declined by 0.8% during this time period.

Store Size and Profitability  The store groups listed in the table below, when combined with our strategic account stores, represented approximately 88%, 87%, and 88% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market. Our remaining sales (approximately 12%, 13%, and 12%, respectively) relate to either: (1) our in-plant locations, (2) our direct Fastenal Cold Heading business (including our Holo-Krome business acquired in December 2009), or (3) our direct import business. Our average store had sales of $67,600, $58,100, and $70,200 per month in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. This average amount was $71,600 per month in the first quarter of 2007 (the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit). The average age, number of stores, and pre-tax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note  Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.  

Our original intent under the pathway to profit was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately $125,000 per month (see earlier discussion) in order to meet our pre-tax earnings profitability goal. This would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories ($0 to $30,000, $30,001 to $60,000, and $60,001 to $100,000) to the last three categories ($60,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $150,000, and over $150,000), and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity. Our goal today is to continue (1) to grow the business and (2) to grow our pre-tax earnings as a percent of net sales. As stated earlier, we now believe, based on the profitability improvements noted in the previous table, that we can hit our pre-tax earnings percent goal of 23% with average store sales of approximately $100,000  $110,000 per month.  

Note  Dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars, not thousands.

Note  Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.  

Gross profit percentage for 2010 increased from 2009, and the gross profit percentage for 2009 decreased from 2008.  

The gross profit percentage in the first, second, third and fourth quarters was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by: (1) transactional gross profit, (2) organizational gross profit, and (3) vendor incentive gross profit. The transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized due to the day-to-day fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs. This component was negatively influenced by the competitive landscape in 2009 which depressed the prices we could charge for our products. This component has generally improved since August 2009, except for customer mix which is discussed later. The organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains. This component was negatively influenced by deflationary impacts in 2009 as we were selling inventory sourced at peak costs late in 2008. This component was magnified in 2009 due to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year. However, this component improved in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2010 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The third component relates to vendor volume allowances. The gross profit dollars associated with this component dropped dramatically in the second half of 2009. However, this component improved in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2010 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. In our second quarter 2010 earnings release, we indicated our belief that the first two components would continue to improve as we progress into the remainder of 2010. This belief was based on (1) our focused effort to raise our transactional margin and (2) the bias which we believed existed for some inflation in 2010 rather than the significant deflation we experienced in 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, our assumptions about the latter half of the year were proven wrong and these two components had a negative impact on gross profit percentage. We continued to struggle with the first component in the fourth quarter, but did see some improvement in the second component due to the expansion of inventory depth which decreased the need for fill in (short-term purchases to fill in an empty shelf, because normal procurement lead times do not meet demand) buys which carry a cost premium. The decrease in gross profit percentage, from the second quarter of 2010 to the third and fourth quarters of 2010 was primarily caused by the strong growth of our industrial production business; which resulted in a change in our overall business mix. The industrial production business has a lower gross margin; therefore, the change in mix pulled our gross margin down. However, since the operating expenses of our industrial production business are lower, operating income produced by that business is similar to our overall business. The second cause was the relative lack of inflation in the third and fourth quarters. Finally, as we indicated in our second quarter 2010 earnings release, vendor volume allowances largely recovered during the second quarter to  

29  

Table of Contents 

 the levels in place in 2008 and in early 2009 due to the reset of vendor allowance programs which tend to be calendar based. However, the fourth quarter of 2010 did see some improvement in this category. Generally speaking, the decline in the gross margin percentage from 2008 to 2009 was evenly split between a deterioration in the three components discussed earlier. The improvement from 2009 to 2010 was primarily related to improvements in vendor incentive gross profit (about half of the improvement), and the balance primarily related to improvements in organizational gross profit and transactional gross profit.  

Operating and administrative expenses improved relative to sales in 2010 versus both 2009 and 2008.  

Historically, 65% to 70% of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs. The components are: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, and (3) education. During 2009, this range had reduced to 60% to 65% due to the factors noted below. During 2010, this range moved back to the historical level.  

The two largest components of employee related costs grew/contracted as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The two largest components of operating and administrative expenses, outside of the employee related costs, grew/contracted as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2010 disparity between the full-time equivalent headcount increase of 10.3% noted earlier and the 16.7% annual increase in payroll costs noted above is driven by several factors: (1) sales commissions earned grew (this increase was amplified by the sales growth and the gross margin expansion, both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned), (2) total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth, (3) hours worked per employee grew, and (4) our profit sharing contribution grew. These four items, when compared to 2009, all grew at a rate faster than the rate of sales growth.  

The 2009 disparity between the full-time equivalent headcount decrease of 15.2% noted earlier and the 18.3% annual decrease in payroll costs noted above is driven by several factors: (1) sales commissions earned contracted (this decrease was amplified by the sales contraction and the gross margin contraction, both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned), (2) total bonuses earned decreased due to our profit contraction, (3) hours worked per employee contracted, and (4) our profit sharing contribution was reduced to zero. These four items, when compared to 2008, all contracted at a rate faster than the rate of sales contraction.  

Our health care costs in 2010 decreased from the unusual peak in 2009. Health care costs in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 increased due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers, increases in COBRA costs due to changes in federal funding within COBRA, and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years. These conditions still exist in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2010; however, the spike in costs in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2009 changed the comparison. On a two year basis, our health care costs are still up significantly despite a decrease in headcount.

Table of Contents 

The two largest components of the remaining costs within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation. Occupancy expenses increased from 2009 to 2010 and increased from 2008 to 2009. The annual increase in occupancy expense was driven by (1) increases in utilities, (2) increases in taxes, (3) new store locations, (4) expansions to our Indianapolis and Dallas distribution centers, and (5) in the case of 2010, our new Holo-Krome facilities. The selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales. Selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses decreased in both years due to (1) fleet reductions, (2) moderating fuel costs, and (3) in the case of 2010, improvements in the resale market for used fleet (pickup) prices.  

The last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline  During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2010, our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately $6.4 million, $6.8 million, $6.6 million, and $7.1 million, respectively. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2009, our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately $5.2 million, $5.7 million, $6.2 million, and $6.1 million, respectively. The changes resulted from variations in fuel costs, variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers, and changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations. These fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles (semi-tractors, straight trucks, and sprinter trucks) which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses (the split in the last several years has been approximately 50:50 between distribution and store use).  

The average per gallon fuel costs (in actual dollars) and the percentage change (on a year-over-year basis) for the last three years was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loss on Sale of Property and Equipment  The loss on sale of property and equipment for 2010 and 2009 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles.  

Income taxes  Incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, were approximately 38.4%, 38.0%, and 38.0% for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. This rate fluctuates over time based on (1) the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, (2) the level of profits in those jurisdictions, and (3) changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions.

Net Earnings  Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2010, the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth. During 2009, the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion. During 2008, the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses. The EPS percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2007, 2008, and 2009.  

Working Capital  Two components of working capital, accounts receivable and inventories, are highlighted below. The annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital. These initiatives include (1) the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management (this facility became operational early in 2005) and (2) the disciplined management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory, new expanded inventory, inventory necessary for upcoming store openings, or inventory necessary for our master stocking hubs.  

The accounts receivable increase of 26.1% from 2009 to 2010 was created by a daily sales increase of 17.9% and 20.9% in November and December 2010, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was greater than the increase in daily sales. This was primarily driven by the significant growth in both our national account (large customer) business and in our international business, both of which typically pay slower than our remaining business. The accounts receivable decrease of 12.6% from 2008 to 2009 relates to a daily sales decrease of 12.0% and 8.6% in November and December 2009, respectively.  

A portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends; therefore, the drop in sales growth activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 and during the first two months of 2009 resulted in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product. The inventory decrease began in March 2009 and continued through most of 2009. Our inventory dropped approximately $9,000, $36,000, and $21,000 during the first, second, and third quarters of 2009, respectively. The inventory grew by approximately $10,000 in the

 fourth quarter of 2009; approximately half of this increase related to our December 2009 acquisition of Holo-Krome and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our distribution centers to support the improving sales trends seen since August 2009. During 2010, our inventory decreased approximately $1,000 in the first quarter, and increased approximately $15,000, $24,000, and $11,000 in the second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively, or a $49,000 increase year-to-date. This was disappointing to us; however, the expanding sales trends noted earlier in this discussion overshadowed the disappointment. In its most simplified view, our expanding inventories are directly related to (1) the expanding sales growth trends (with emphasis on our large account business  both OEM & MRO), (2) our confidence in their sustainability, and (3) an increase in the rate of store openings.  

As we indicated in earlier communications, our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory (Annual Sales: AR&I) back to a better than a 3.0:1 ratio. On December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a ratio of 2.7:1.  

Acquisition  On December 18, 2009, we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products (a type of fastener). The business had an established name, Holo-Krome, and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees. The business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results (there were some balance sheet impacts of the all cash acquisition, as noted in our cash flow statement). The acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in 2010.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Net cash provided by operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2010 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales. The 2009 and 2008 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above.  

The approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on December 31: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

New stores open with the standard store model, which consists of a core stocking level of approximately $50 thousand per location. This inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows.

Property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from 2009 to 2010. The net expenditures for property and equipment (purchases less proceeds of disposals) increased from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to increases for expansions at our Indianapolis, Indiana distribution center and related to increased spending for our Fastenal Automated Solutions Technology, which primarily consists of automated vending equipment. The 2009 decrease in investing activities from 2008 is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in 2009 of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center which occurred in 2008, and the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of short-term marketable securities in 2009. The 2008 increase in investing activities was primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center, the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center noted above.  

Property and equipment expenditures in 2010, 2009 and 2008 consist of: (1) purchase of software and hardware for Fastenals information processing systems, (2) addition of certain pickup trucks, (3) purchase of signage, shelving, and other fixed assets related to store openings, (4) addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment, (5) expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties, (6) expansion of Fastenals distribution/trucking fleet, (7) cost related to the relocation of our new Dallas, Texas distribution center (2008), (8) cost related to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center (2008, 2009, and 2010), (9) cost of a new manufacturing facility in Rockford, Illinois (2008), (10) cost of a new manufacturing facility for our Holo-Krome business in Wallingford, Connecticut (2010), and (11) purchases related to our Fastenal Automated Solutions Technology, which primarily consists of automated vending equipment (2009 and 2010). Disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick-up trucks, semi-tractors, and trailers in the normal course of business, the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and, in the case of 2008, the disposal of our former Dallas, Texas distribution center.  

An estimate of our 2011 net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2010 net capital expenditures is provided below. As of year end, we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures.  

We anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations, from available cash and cash equivalents, and, if necessary, from our borrowing capacity. In addition to opening new stores in the United States, we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years. These items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Stock Repurchase  In July 2009, our board of directors authorized purchases by us of up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. This authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors. During 2009, we purchased 1,100,000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately $37.37 per share. These purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. We did not purchase any stock in 2010. As of February 9, 2011, we have remaining authority to purchase up to 900,000 additional shares of our common stock.  

Dividends  We declared a dividend of $0.50 per share on January 17, 2011. We paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24, $0.72, and $0.79 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  

Line of Credit  We have an $8,000 line of credit under which $0 was outstanding at year end. The line bears interest at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.  

Effects of Inflation  We noted minimal price changes in 2010. Price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009. Price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008.  

Critical Accounting Policies  Our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts  This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. The analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable, the financial condition of a customer or industry, and general economic conditions. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers.  

Inventory reserve  This reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage. The reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends. The analysis includes inventory levels, sales information, physical inventory counts, cycle count adjustments, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

Health insurance reserve  This reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

General insurance reserve  This reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation, property and casualty losses, and other self-insured losses. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

Tax strategies  Our effective income tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We establish income tax reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit, when (i) there is a completion of a tax audit, (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods.  

Legal reserves  Occasionally we are involved in legal matters. The outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures. We record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation, the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded.

New Accounting Pronouncements  

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. This update requires entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements and provides clarification of existing disclosure requirements. For assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the ASU requires disclosure of significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2, and transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. Significant transfers into each level must be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level. Significance is judged with respect to earnings, total assets, total liabilities or total equity. An accounting policy must be determined and disclosed as to when transfers between levels are recognized: (1) actual date, (2) beginning of period or (3) end of period. The ASU amends the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of Level 3 recurring fair value measurements to present information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than as a net number. The ASU amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 to require fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and clarifies that a description of the valuation technique and inputs used to measure fair value is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This standard became effective in 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level activity of purchases, sales, issuances and settlement on a gross basis, which will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2011. Since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only, its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09, Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements. This update amends guidance on subsequent events. This amendment removes the requirement for SEC filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events. However, the date-disclosure exemption does not relieve management of an SEC filer from its responsibility to evaluate subsequent events through the date on which financial statements are issued. This standard became effective in the first quarter of 2010. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

Proposed Accounting Pronouncements  

In recent exposure drafts, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the FASB proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases. From a lessees perspective, the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and finance/capital leases. In its place, a right-of-use model would be used. This proposal, as currently written, would require the lessee to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments. This would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized. This exposure draft is not yet finalized; however, we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and many of our vehicles are currently leased, and those leases are accounted for as operating leases.  

Geographic Information  Information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading Certain Risks and Uncertainties and Item 1A. Risk Factors.
