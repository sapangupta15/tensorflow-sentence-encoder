PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 94.1% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2014. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Vornado” refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.  

On January 15, 2015, we completed the spin-off of substantially all of our retail segment comprised of 79 strip shopping centers, three malls, a warehouse park and $225 million of cash to Urban Edge Properties (“UE”) (NYSE: UE). As part of this transaction, we received 5,712,000 UE operating partnership units (5.4% ownership interest).

Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area 

· Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value 

· Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

Since January 1, 2014, we completed the following acquisitions: 

· A 74.3% interest in the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel, located on the Southeast corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue, for $700 million  

· The land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property, located on the Southeast corner of 58th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, for $63 million 

· We increased our ownership in One Park Avenue to 55.0% from 46.5% through a joint venture with an institutional investor  

· We increased our ownership in Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel to 33% from 11% by co-investing with our 25% owned Real Estate Fund and one of the Fund’s limited partners to buy out the Fund’s joint venture partner’s 57% interest

SEGMENT DATA 

We operate in the following business segments: New York, Washington, DC, Retail Properties, and Toys “R” Us (“Toys”). Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is set forth in Note 25 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal and substantially all of Toys’ net income is generated in its fourth quarter, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter. The New York and Washington, DC segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income. 

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Certain Activities 

We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately 4,503 employees, of which 329 are corporate staff. The New York segment has 3,400 employees, including 2,735 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York and Washington, DC properties and 508 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Washington, DC and Retail Properties segments have 457 and 77 employees, respectively and the Mart properties have 240 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities.
