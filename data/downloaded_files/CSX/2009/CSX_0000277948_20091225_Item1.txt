Item 1. Business by Segment 

CSX Corporation (“CSX”) together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation suppliers. The Company’s rail and intermodal businesses provide rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. 

Rail 

CSX Transportation, Inc. 

CSX’s principal operating company, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000 route mile rail network, which serves major population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It serves over 70 ocean, river and lake ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. 

Other Entities 

In addition to CSXT, the rail segment includes non-railroad subsidiaries Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations, while Transflo provides logistical solutions for transferring products from rail to trucks. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company. 

Intermodal 

CSX Intermodal, Inc. (“Intermodal”) is a stand-alone, integrated intermodal transportation provider linking customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. Containers and trailers are loaded and unloaded from trains, and trucks provide the link between intermodal terminals and the customer. 

Lines of Business 

Together, the rail and intermodal segments generated $9 billion of revenue during 2009 and served four primary lines of business: 

  ·    The merchandise business is the most diverse market with nearly 2.1 million carloads per year of aggregates (which includes crushed stone, sand and gravel), metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer (manufactured goods and appliances), agricultural, paper and chemical products. The merchandise business generated approximately 48% of the Company’s revenue in 2009 and 36% of volume.

  ·    Coal, which delivered approximately 1.6 million carloads of coal, coke and iron ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers and terminals, steel makers and industrial plants, accounted for approximately 30% of the Company’s revenue in 2009 and 27% of volume. The Company transports almost one-third of every ton of coal used for generating electricity in the areas it serves.    

  ·    Automotive, which delivers finished vehicles and auto parts, generated approximately 6% of the Company’s revenue and 4% of the Company’s volume in 2009. The Company delivers approximately 30% of North America’s light vehicles, serving both domestic manufacturers and the increasing number of global manufacturers that produce cars in the United States.    

  ·    Intermodal, which combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the short-haul flexibility of trucks, offers a competitive cost advantage over long-haul trucking. Through its network of more than 50 terminals, Intermodal serves all major markets east of the Mississippi and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments. For 2009, Intermodal accounted for approximately 13% of the Company’s total revenue and 33% of volume.    

Other revenue, which includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads, demurrage, switching and other incidental charges, accounted for 3% of the Company’s total 2009 revenue. Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held beyond a specified period of time. Switching revenue is generated when CSXT switches cars between trains for a customer or another railroad. 

Other Businesses 

CSX’s other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the Company’s real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. These activities are classified in other income – net because they are not considered by the Company to be operating activities. Results of these activities fluctuate with the timing of real estate sales. In 2009, CSX sold the stock of a subsidiary that indirectly owned Greenbrier Hotel Corporation, owner of The Greenbrier resort. These results are now classified as discontinued operations. For more information, see Note 14, Discontinued Operations.

Company History 

A leader in freight rail transportation for more than 180 years, the Company’s roots date back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”) – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. 

Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors. 

CSX was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System (“Chessie”) and Seaboard Coast Line Industries (“Seaboard”) into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. In 1986, the Chessie and Seaboard operating entities were transferred to the rail entity CSXT, which was created through the merger. Intermodal was originally formed in 1986 in order to provide nationwide, door-to-door intermodal service. 

In 1997, CSXT and Norfolk Southern Railway jointly acquired the rights to operate Conrail, Inc. (“Conrail”) and then in 2004, CSXT acquired an allocated portion of Conrail’s assets, which CSXT operated. Conrail was formed in 1976 from several financially troubled northeast railroads to restructure and revive the region’s railroads. The Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail allows CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago, midwest markets and the growing areas in the southeast that were already served by CSXT. This current rail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally friendly and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.

Regulatory Environment 

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, generally applicable to many businesses in the United States. The railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars and locomotives, and hazardous materials requirements. Additionally, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may include homeland security implications. 

Decisions and rulemaking by these and other agencies can significantly affect the Company’s operations and profitability. For example, in 2008, both DOT and TSA issued rules that apply to the transportation of certain kinds of highly hazardous materials. The DOT rules require railroads to analyze routes used to transport these products and to apply specific criteria in selecting routes to be used. The new TSA rules place significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems, and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. In some cases, state and local laws and regulations can be preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other federal authorities. 

Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the Company's subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision, the STB has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices, including some railroad rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. This includes jurisdiction over freight car charges, the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers. 

In 2008, Congress enacted the Rail Safety Improvement Act. The legislation includes a mandate that all Class I freight railroads implement a positive train control system (“PTC”) by December 31, 2015. PTC must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as those over which toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials (“TIH”) are transported. Implementation of a PTC system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work-zone limits, and a train from diverting off-course onto another set of tracks through a switch left in a wrong position. Significant capital costs are anticipated with the implementation of PTC as well as ongoing operating expenses. CSX estimates that the total cost of PTC implementation will likely exceed $750 million for the Company.

PART I 

In December 2009, a proposed bill called the “Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2009” (“STB Reauthorization Bill”) was introduced in the Senate. If adopted as proposed, this bill could have a material adverse effect on commercial practices and railroad operations. The current proposal in the Senate contains fundamental changes in laws that were designed to sustain the railroads. Some of the proposed changes in the STB Reauthorization Bill are not yet clearly defined, and others call for new and broad government involvement into railroad operations. CSX believes the bill, in its current form, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenue and operations, as well as the ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. CSX will continue to work diligently with the Senate staff, as well as with Senators, to forge a balanced regulatory approach. 

For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Competition 

The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation. 

CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
