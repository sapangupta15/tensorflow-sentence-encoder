PART I  

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

Overview  

American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (American), Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont), and PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American, which was founded in 1934. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11. Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAGs internal corporate structure and as part of the integration efforts following the business combination of AAG and US Airways Group, AAG caused US Airways Group to be merged with and into AAG, with AAG as the surviving corporation, and, immediately thereafter, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger of US Airways and American, US Airways transferred all of its assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments to American. For financial reporting purposes, this transaction constituted a transfer of assets between entities under common control and was accounted for at historical cost. Certain employees of American continue to work under the terms of separate collective bargaining agreements that were applicable to them as employees of US Airways. Virtually all of AAGs operations fall within the airline industry.  

AAGs and Americans principal executive offices are located at 4333 Amon Carter Boulevard, Fort Worth, Texas 76155. AAGs and Americans telephone number is 817-963-1234, and their Internet address is www.aa.com. Information contained on AAGs and Americans website is not and should not be deemed a part of this report or any other report or filing filed with or furnished to the SEC.  

Airline Operations  

As noted above, AAG is a holding company whose primary business activity is the operation of a major network carrier through its principal wholly-owned mainline operating subsidiary, American.  

Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries from our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Los Angeles (LAX), Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2015, approximately 201 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 946 mainline aircraft and are supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 587 regional aircraft.  

American is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, whose members and members-elect serve nearly 1,000 destinations with 14,250 daily flights to 150 countries.  

Our cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe.

Regional Operations  

Our wholly-owned regional carriers, Envoy, Piedmont and PSA, as well as certain third-party regional carriers have arrangements with us to provide regional feed under the trade name American Eagle. American Eagle carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on feeder traffic from these regional carriers, which carry passengers to our hubs from low-density markets that are uneconomical for us to serve with large jets. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in our existing mainline markets by operating flights during off-peak periods between mainline flights. During 2015, approximately 54 million passengers boarded our regional carriers planes, approximately 47% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. Of these passengers, approximately 24 million were enplaned by our wholly-owned regional carriers and approximately 30 million were enplaned by third-party regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements.  

The American Eagle arrangements are principally in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, mail and freight revenues, go to us. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that we will reimburse 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees and passenger liability insurance. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. A very small number of regional aircraft are operated for us under prorate agreements, under which the regional carriers receive a prorated share of ticket revenue and pay certain service fees to us. The prorate carriers are responsible for all costs incurred operating the applicable aircraft. All American Eagle carriers have logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to our mainline operations.  

Chapter 11 Reorganization  

On November 29, 2011 (the Petition Date), AMR Corporation, its principal subsidiary, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the Chapter 11 Cases) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order) approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan).  

On December 9, 2013 (the Effective Date), the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan, principally through the transactions contemplated by an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2013, by and among AMR, AMR Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub) and US Airways Group, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into US Airways Group (the Merger), with US Airways Group surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR following the Merger.  

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, trading in AMRs common stock and certain debt securities on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was suspended on January 5, 2012, and AMRs common stock and such debt securities were delisted from the NYSE on January 30, 2012. On January 5, 2012, AMRs common stock began trading under the symbol AAMRQ (CUSIP 001765106) on the OTCQB marketplace. Pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date (i) all existing shares of AAGs old common stock formerly traded under the symbol AAMRQ were canceled and (ii) the Company was authorized to issue up to approximately 544 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AAG (AAG Common Stock) by operation of the Plan (excluding shares of AAG Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement). On the Effective Date, the AAG Common Stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol AAL, and AAMRQ ceased trading on the OTCQB marketplace.

Table of Contents 

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, AAG issued approximately 53 million shares of AAG Common Stock to AMRs old equity holders and certain of the Debtors employees, and issued 168 million shares of AAG Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the AAG Series A Preferred Stock), which was mandatorily convertible into new AAG Common Stock during the 120-day period after the Effective Date, to certain creditors and employees of the Debtors (including shares deposited in the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined in the Plan)). In accordance with the terms of the Plan, former holders of AMR common stock (previously traded under the symbol AAMRQ) received, for each share of AMR common stock, an initial distribution of approximately 0.0665 shares of the AAG Common Stock as of the Effective Date. Following the Effective Date, former holders of AMR common stock and those deemed to be treated as such in connection with the elections made pursuant to the Plan have received through December 31, 2015, additional aggregate distributions of shares of AAG Common Stock of approximately 0.6776 shares of AAG Common Stock for each share of AMR common stock previously held, and may continue to receive additional distributions. As of the Effective Date, the adjusted total Double-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) were approximately $2.5 billion and the Allowed Single-Dip General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) were approximately $2.5 billion. The Disputed Claims Reserve established under the Plan was initially issued 30.4 million shares, which shares are reserved for distributions to holders of disputed Single-Dip Unsecured Claims (Single-Dip Equity Obligations) whose claims ultimately become allowed as well as to certain AMR labor groups and employees who received a deemed claim amount based upon a fixed percentage of the distributions to be made to general unsecured claimholders. As of December 31, 2015, the Disputed Claims Reserve held 25.3 million shares of AAG Common Stock pending distribution of those shares in accordance with the Plan.  

See Part II, Item 5. Market for American Airlines Groups Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Note 2 and Note 4 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 2 and Note 4 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases, the Merger and the Disputed Claims Reserve.  

Merger  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and consistent with the Plan, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of US Airways Group (the US Airways Group Common Stock) was converted into the right to receive one share of AAG Common Stock. The aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable in the Merger to holders of US Airways Group equity instruments (including stockholders, holders of convertible notes, optionees, and holders of restricted stock units (RSUs)) represented 28% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG. The remaining 72% diluted equity ownership in AAG (up to approximately 544 million shares) was or is distributable, pursuant to the Plan (see Chapter 11 Reorganization above), to stakeholders, labor unions, certain employees of AMR and the other Debtors, and former holders of AMR common stock (previously traded under the symbol AAMRQ) such that the aggregate number of shares of AAG Common Stock issuable under the Plan will not exceed 72% of the diluted equity ownership of AAG as of the time of the Merger.  

In connection with the completion of the Merger, the NYSE suspended trading in the US Airways Group Common Stock prior to the opening of the market on December 9, 2013. The US Airways Group Common Stock was delisted from the NYSE and registration of the US Airways Group Common Stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act was terminated.

The U.S. Airline Industry  

In 2015, the U.S. airline industry benefited significantly from lower fuel prices. However, this benefit was offset in part by a decline in revenues driven by reduced yields.  

Jet fuel prices closely follow the price of Brent crude oil. Oil prices declined significantly throughout 2015, and in December, the price of Brent crude oil fell below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009. On average, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel was approximately 47% lower in 2015 as compared to 2014. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during 2015 was $52 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $99 per barrel during 2014. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during 2015 between a high of $66 per barrel to a low of $35 per barrel, and closed the year on December 31, 2015 at $37 per barrel.  

With respect to revenue, in its most recent data available through the third quarter of 2015, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields declined as compared to 2014. Additionally, domestic markets outperformed international markets (Atlantic, Pacific and Latin America) in both yield and overall revenue performance.  

While jet fuel prices have declined year-over-year as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these declines. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business and Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.  

Competition  

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and loyalty program initiatives. On most of our domestic non-stop routes, we currently face competing service from at least one, and sometimes more than one, domestic airline, including: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.  

On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile (ASM) and to establish, increase or preserve market share. Discount and promotional fares are generally non-refundable and may be subject to various restrictions such as minimum stay requirements, advance ticketing, limited seating and change fees. We have often elected to match discount or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market. In addition, low-fare, low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and Jet Blue Airways, and so-called ultra low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing. For example, at our DFW hub and in a number of other markets we face more competition (as measured by ASMs) from ultra low-cost carriers than from major network carriers.  

In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines which provide similar services at their hubs and other locations.

Table of Contents 

 We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, markets served and other services. We compete with both major network airlines and low-cost carriers throughout our network.  

In addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Central and South America, Asia, Europe and Australia. Revenues from foreign operations (flights serving international destinations) were approximately 30% of our total operating revenues in 2015. In 2015, we expanded our global footprint by adding 38 new routes, including 20 international and 18 domestic. Notable new routes include DFW to Beijing, LAX to Sydney and LAX to Mexico City. In providing international air transportation, we compete with U.S. airlines to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations, foreign investor-owned airlines, and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines, including carriers based in the Middle East, the three largest of which we believe benefit from significant government subsidies.  

Agreements with Other Airlines  

In general, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets beyond the nonstop city pair have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers rights to carry passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each others markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers, including American, have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Air Berlin, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, EL AL, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hainan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Interjet, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, Jetstar Group (includes Jetstar Airways and Jetstar Japan), Korean Air, LATAM (includes LAN Airlines, LAN Argentina, LAN Colombia, LAN Ecuador, LAN Peru, TAM Airlines and TAM Mercosur), Malaysia Airlines, Niki Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines and WestJet.  

American is also a founding member of the oneworld alliance, which includes Air Berlin, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, SriLankan Airlines and TAM Airlines. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers loyalty programs and access to the carriers airport lounge facilities. Together, oneworld members and members-elect serve nearly 1,000 destinations with 14,250 daily flights to 150 countries.  

American is party to antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Royal Jordanian, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines and LAN Peru. American has also established joint business agreements (JBAs) with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair and separately Japan Airlines that enable the carriers to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs. In addition, American applied for regulatory approval to enter into a JBA with Qantas Airways and has or will be applying for regulatory approval of a JBA with LATAM Airlines Group air carriers in the relevant jurisdictions affected by the JBA.  

Industry Regulation and Airport Access  

General  

Our airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. The DOT maintains jurisdiction over the  

9  

Table of Contents 

 approval of domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, and consumer protection and competition matters, such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.  

The FAA regulates significant aspects of our business, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance, and other operational and safety areas. Pursuant to these regulations, our airline subsidiaries have FAA-approved maintenance programs for each type of aircraft they operate. The programs provide for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from routine inspections to unscheduled repairs and comprehensive scheduled overhauls. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment, systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft, safety measures and equipment, advanced navigation and communication gear, advanced collision avoidance and position reporting systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement standards, other environmental concerns, fuel tank inerting, crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements, and many other technical aspects of airline operations. We are also obligated to comply with various airworthiness directives, service bulletins and other requirements designed to safely correct known issues with aircraft or major components that are discovered after original type certification or manufacture. Some of these directives require us to perform significant maintenance and engineering work and to incur substantial additional expenses. Based on the current known requirements and implementation schedules, we expect to remain in full compliance with these ongoing airworthiness requirements. Our failure to timely comply with these requirements has in the past, and could in the future, result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. The FAA also operates the air traffic control (ATC) system in the United States.  

The FAA imposes stringent and complicated mandatory rest requirements for pilots, which are in addition to other limitations on allowable pilot duty times. The FAA also recently implemented rules that increase minimum qualifications for pilots to operate commercial aircraft. These requirements and rules have increased our costs and added complication to our crew scheduling.  

Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the ticket tax, on domestic and international air transportation. Airlines collect the ticket tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation, and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Agricultures Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service very recently increased the fees we must pay for arriving international flights, and for certain other related government services, which will increase our incremental costs of providing cargo services. See Industry Regulation and Airport Access  Security, below for a discussion of passenger fees.  

Most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge (PFC). The ability of airports to increase this charge (and the ability of airlines to contest such increases) is restricted by federal legislation, DOT regulations and judicial decisions. We and other airlines may be unable to recover all of these additional charges from passengers through increased fares. The current cap on the PFC is $4.50 per passenger, but the industry has faced repeated efforts in Congress to raise the cap to a higher level.  

DOT consumer rules that took effect in 2010 require procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, including additional reporting requirements for airlines, that have increased the cost of airline operations and reduced revenues. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these rules. In addition, the DOT finalized a second set of rules that further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. These rules require airlines to display all fares in an all in basis, with the price of the air travel and all taxes and government imposed fees rolled into the displayed fare. Enhanced disclosure of ancillary fees such as baggage fees is also required. Other rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international carriers. A third rulemaking that would further regulate consumer interaction with airlines is pending before the DOT, with a final rule expected in 2016.  

10  

Table of Contents 

The DOT has continued its efforts to further regulate airlines through increased data reporting requirements, expansion of the Air Carrier Access Act and greater oversight of the methods airlines use to describe and sell air transportation and other products and services. Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to our operation. In this environment, no assurance can be given that compliance with these new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FAA or other regulatory bodies, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Among its regulatory responsibilities, the DOT also enforces equal access to air transportation for disabled passengers. Over time, a number of carriers, including American, have entered into consent orders with the DOT over their handling of disabled passengers. The DOT has been aggressive in prosecuting disability violations and seeks large penalties. We expect to see continued DOT emphasis in this area through both regulation and enforcement.  

The DOT and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). In addition, as a result of heightened levels of concern regarding data privacy, we are subject to an increasing number of domestic and foreign laws regarding the privacy and security of passenger and employee data.  

International  

International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the European Union (EU), and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve are periodically subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. The U.S. government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of important markets to us do not have open skies agreements, including China, Hong Kong and Mexico. In addition, at some foreign airports, an air carrier needs slots and other facilities before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service. The availability of slots is not assured, and our inability to obtain and retain needed slots and facilities could therefore inhibit our efforts to compete in certain international markets. See Industry Regulation and Airport Access  Airport Access and Operations, below and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations for additional information.  

Security  

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Aviation Security Act) was enacted in November 2001. Under the Aviation Security Act, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security screening were federalized and a new Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created under the DOT. The TSA was then transferred to the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Aviation Security Act, among other matters, mandates; improved flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors;  

11  

Table of Contents 

 enhanced security training; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports pursuant to regulations issued in connection with the Aviation Security Act; and the provision of certain passenger data to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer monies. To help finance the cost of aviation security, air carriers are required to collect and remit to the TSA a passenger security fee of $5.60 per one-way trip and not more than $11.20 per round trip on qualifying air transportation sold.  

Implementation of and compliance with the requirements of the Aviation Security Act have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers and have resulted and will likely continue to result in service disruptions and delays. As a result of competitive pressure, we and other airlines may be unable to recover all of these additional security costs from passengers through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security and safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the costs or financial impact of complying with any such requirements.  

Airline Fares  

Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, fare overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets.  

Airport Access and Operations  

Domestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) are also limited based on the stage length of the flight.  

In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at DCA in Washington, D.C. and three New York City airports: Newark Liberty International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LGA. There is currently an open Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the management and use of slots at the three New York City airports. Our operations at DCA and those New York City airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities. Similarly, our operations at Frankfurt, London, Paris and other international airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the International Air Transport Associations Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines (WSG) and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental policies.  

In connection with the settlement of litigation relating to the Merger brought by the DOJ and certain states, we entered into settlement agreements that provided for certain asset divestitures, including 52 slot pairs at DCA, 17 slot pairs at LGA and gates and related ground facilities necessary to operate those slot pairs, and two gates at each of Boston Logan International Airport, Chicago OHare International Airport (ORD), Dallas Love Field  

12  

Table of Contents 

 Airport (DAL), LAX and Miami International Airport. The settlement agreements also require us to maintain certain hub operations and continue to provide service to certain specified communities for limited periods of time. In addition, we entered into a related settlement with the DOT related to small community service from DCA. Further, as a consequence of the Merger clearance process in the EU, we made one pair of London Heathrow slots available for use by another carrier and, along with our JBA partners, we made one pair of London Heathrow slots available to competitors for use for up to six years in different markets.  

Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as ORD and LAX, where the airport gate and other facilities are inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide.  

The DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. Certain locales, including Boston, Washington D.C., Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco, among others, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of these operations. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs, and these restrictions could limit the ability of our airline subsidiaries to expand their operations at the affected airports. Authorities at other airports may adopt similar noise regulations. We are continuing to see an increase in these issues throughout the country. See Industry Regulation and Airport Access  Environmental Matters, below.  

Civil Reserve Air Fleet  

We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, which is a voluntary program administered by the U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command. The General Services Administration of the U.S. Government requires that airlines participate in the CRAF program in order to receive U.S. Government business. We are reimbursed at compensatory rates if aircraft are activated under the CRAF program or when participating in Department of Defense business. If a substantial number of our aircraft are activated for operation under the CRAF program at a time of war or other national emergency, our business operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In January 2014, the U.S. Air Force proposed significant changes to the CRAF program which have not yet taken effect. Together with other industry participants, we are working with the U.S. Air Force to address our concerns with the new proposals.  

Environmental Matters  

Environmental and noise regulation. The airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.  

The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs; we anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.  

Climate change regulation. Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate GHG emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive in 2008 under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. This directive would have required us, beginning in 2012, to annually submit emission allowances in order to operate flights to and from airports in the European Economic Area (EEA), including flights between the U.S. and EU member states. However, in an effort to allow the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) time to propose an alternate scheme to manage global aviation emissions, in April 2013, the EU suspended for one year the ETS application to flights entering and departing the EEA, limiting its application, for flights flown in 2012, to intra-EEA flights only. In October 2013, the ICAO Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the development through ICAO of a global, market-based scheme for aviation GHG emissions, to be finalized in 2016 and implemented in 2020. Subsequently, the EU has amended the EU ETS so that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for aviation GHG emissions will continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights through 2016, at which time the EU will evaluate the progress made by ICAO and determine what, if any, measures to take related to aviation GHG emissions from 2017 onwards. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 which encourages the DOT to seek an international solution through ICAO and that will allow the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. The effort currently underway through ICAO to reach a global agreement on measures to manage international aviation GHG emission growth could significantly impact our business, particularly to the extent that any final agreement may emphasize a collective cost sharing approach for industry emissions growth over a cost approach based on individual carrier contribution to emission growth.  

In addition, in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCCs COP21), over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions. While there is no express reference to aviation in this international agreement, to the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement, either with respect to the aviation industry or with respect to related industries such as the aviation fuel industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.  

Within the U.S., there is an increasing trend toward regulating GHG emissions directly under the CAA. In response to a 2012 ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the EPA announced in June 2015 a proposed endangerment finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. If the EPA finalizes the endangerment finding, the EPA is obligated under the CAA to set aircraft engine GHG emission standards. It is anticipated that any such standards established by EPA would closely align with emission standards currently being developed by ICAO. In February 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) recommended that ICAO adopt carbon dioxide certification standards that would apply to new type aircraft certified beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023.  

In addition, several states have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs.  

These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the U.S., the EU or in

 other areas in which we do business. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations, or the operations of our suppliers, may be subject to additional operating and other permit requirements, potentially resulting in increased operating costs.  

Future Regulatory Developments  

Future regulatory developments and actions could affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry, including our airline subsidiaries. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations, Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages and We are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result for additional information.  

Employees and Labor Relations  

The airline business is labor intensive. In 2015, salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expenses and represented approximately 31% of our operating expenses.  

The table below presents our approximate number of active full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2015.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 82% of AAGs total active employees were represented by various labor unions and covered by CBAs as detailed in the table below.

Relations with such labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, the National Mediation Board (NMB) is responsible for determining which union, if any, is designated to represent employees. In an airline merger, when different unions represent the employees at the merging carrier, a union may file an application with the NMB to represent the combined group of post-merger employees. The application is reviewed by the NMB, which considers whether the operations of the merging carriers have been sufficiently integrated to constitute a single transportation system. After the integration process is found to have created a single transportation system, the NMB then conducts an investigation to determine which union, if any, is to be the representative of the post-merger employees. That union then negotiates a joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) covering the combined group of post-merger employees.  

When an RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached, either party may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months and even for several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare under the RLA at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to binding arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, an initial 30-day cooling off period commences. Following the conclusion of that 30-day cooling off period, if no agreement has been reached, self-help (as described below) can begin unless a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) is established. A PEB examines the parties positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and (if no resolution is reached) is followed by another cooling off period of 30 days. At the end of a cooling off period (unless an agreement is reached, a PEB is established, or action is taken by Congress), the labor organization may exercise self-help, such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own self-help, including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.  

In 2014 and 2015, we reached agreements with several labor unions. On December 18, 2014, we reached a JCBA with the APFA. The new agreement did not require ratification and was effective immediately with the wage increases under the JCBA becoming effective January 1, 2015.  

On January 3, 2015, we reached a tentative agreement with the APA on a five-year JCBA, which was ratified on January 30, 2015. The new, higher pay rates were implemented retroactive to December 2, 2014.  

In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the CWA-IBT for a new JCBA applicable to passenger service employees, which was ratified in November 2015 and provided significant pay increases for combined passenger service employees, effective immediately.  

Most of the other mainline American ground employees are covered by existing TWU agreements that will not become amendable until 2018. The approximate 10,000 US Airways mechanics, fleet service agents and stores employees are covered by IAM agreements that also become amendable in 2018. In August 2014, the TWU and the IAM together filed single transportation system applications to jointly represent the combined groups of mainline US Airways and mainline American mechanics, fleet service and stores employees. The NMB certified the TWU-IAM alliance as the representative of the American mechanics, fleet service and stores employees, and JCBA negotiations for those combined groups are now underway.  

The TWU represented both the mainline American and the mainline US Airways dispatchers, flight simulator engineers and flight crew training instructors prior to the merger, and the NMB has certified the TWU as the representative of each of those employee groups post-merger.  

The Merger had no impact on the CBAs that cover the employees of our wholly-owned subsidiary airlines which are not being merged (Envoy, Piedmont and PSA).

Table of Contents 

Certain union-represented American mainline employees are covered by agreements that are not currently amendable. Until those agreements become amendable, negotiations for JCBAs will be conducted outside the traditional RLA bargaining process described above, and, in the meantime, no self-help will be permissible. The Piedmont mechanics and stock clerks and the PSA dispatchers have agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations.  

None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted refusals to work, such as strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance.  

For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.  

Aircraft Fuel  

Our operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel. Based on our 2016 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2015, a one cent per gallon increase in aviation fuel price would increase our 2016 annual fuel expense by $44 million.  

The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline operations for 2015 and 2014 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total fuel expenses for our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements of American were $1.2 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.  

Fuel prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.  

Insurance  

We maintain insurance of the types that we believe are customary in the airline industry, including insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage, and all-risk coverage for damage to our aircraft. Principal coverage includes liability for injury to members of the public, including passengers, damage to  

18  

Table of Contents 

 property of AAG, its subsidiaries and others, and loss of or damage to flight equipment, whether on the ground or in flight. We also maintain other types of insurance such as workers compensation and employers liability, with limits and deductibles that we believe are standard within the industry.  

In addition, insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general following September 11, 2001. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the period immediately after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, if commercial insurance carriers reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to us or significantly increase its cost, we would be materially adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.  

Customer Service  

We are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. The table below summarizes the operating statistics we reported to the DOT for our mainline operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We are working to improve these metrics by making investments in our operations, which include the hiring of additional maintenance personnel to reduce the time aircraft are out of service. We are also making capital investments in new baggage handling technology.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Percentage of reported flight operations arriving less than 15 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.  

 (b)  Percentage of scheduled flight operations completed.  

 (c)  Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.  

 (d)  Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.  

Loyalty Program  

Our loyalty program, AAdvantage® was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, the American Eagle carriers, the third-party regional carriers and other participating airlines or by using services of other participants in these programs. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on American, the American Eagle carriers or other participating airlines, or for other awards. Once a member accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the member may book award travel. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A members mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months.  

In 2015, we completed the integration of the US Airways Dividend Miles program into Americans AAdvantage program. Also, to ensure we are rewarding our most loyal customers, we announced a program change to occur in the second half of 2016, whereby customers will earn award miles based on dollars spent rather than distance flown.  

American sells mileage credits and related services to other partners in the AAdvantage program primarily with the purpose of awarding qualifying members based on their usage of our co-branded credit cards or the usage of other services, hotels and rental cars provided by partners. There are over 1,000 program partners, including leading credit card issuers (Citibank and BarclaycardUS), hotels, car rental companies and other  

19  

Table of Contents 

 products and services companies. We believe that program partners benefit from the sustained purchasing behavior of their members, which translates into incremental and recurring streams of revenues for us. Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the AAdvantage program at any time without notice, and may end the program with six months notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change. As of December 31, 2015, AAdvantage had approximately 853.6 billion outstanding award miles. During 2015, AAdvantage issued approximately 315 billion miles, of which approximately 58% were sold to program partners.  

We and other participating airline partners limit the number of seats per flight that are available for redemption by award recipients by using various inventory management techniques. We charge various fees for issuing awards dependent upon destination and booking method and for issuing awards within 21 days of the travel date.  

All travel on eligible tickets will count toward qualification for elite status in the AAdvantage program. Elite members can enjoy additional benefits of the AAdvantage program, including First and Business Class check-in, priority security and priority boarding, complimentary access to Preferred Seats, priority baggage delivery, and checked bags at no charge.  

See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for more information on AAdvantage.  

Ticket Distribution  

Passengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels including their direct websites (www.aa.com), our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity). To remain competitive, we will need to successfully manage our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.  

Seasonality and Other Factors  

Due to the greater demand for air and leisure travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.  

Unaudited quarterly financial data for the two-year period ended December 31, 2015 is included in Note 20 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 18 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.
