Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“IPG,” “we,” “us” or “our”). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. Our MD&A includes the following sections:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds and debt credit ratings.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2013 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During 2013, our organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth in our domestic market, which was a result of net new business with clients won during the year and growth with existing clients. Our international organic increase was primarily in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, across our marketing disciplines. The Continental Europe region weighed on our international growth, mainly due to a challenging economic climate. Across most regional markets, we continued to have strong growth in demand for our digital, media and marketing services. Increased operating expenses reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio and growing disciplines, as well as to service our existing clients. We incurred expenses for restructuring in order to better align our cost structure with our revenue, primarily in Continental Europe. 

With challenging economic conditions in many markets around the world, particularly in Europe, marketers continue to show a degree of caution in their marketing investment. We continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base, our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. We continued to enhance our businesses during 2013 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities: fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions and strategic world markets. We believe our continued investment in tools, technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services. 

We continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends, share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet. During 2013, average diluted shares decreased by 11% primarily due to share repurchases. Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $0.62, $1.01 and $1.12 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $0.61, $0.94 and $0.99 per share, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013 included a negative impact of $0.12 and $0.11 per share, respectively, from the effects of restructuring and related costs, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013 included a negative impact of $0.06 per share from a loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 included $0.14 and $0.12 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $0.27 and $0.23 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, net of tax.

The following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared with the same periods in 2012 and 2011.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. The performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector, where we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitutes approximately 55% to 60% of our annual consolidated revenues. We also analyze revenue by geographic region.

The change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk. Our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency. Both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. The primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2013 include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Japanese Yen and the South African Rand. During 2013, the U.S. Dollar was stronger relative to several foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prior-year period, which had a net negative impact on our 2013 consolidated results of operations. For 2013, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 1% in revenues and operating expenses, which had a minimal impact on our operating margin percentage. For 2012, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 2% in revenues and operating expenses, which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage.

For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. During the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. For 2013 and 2012, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the prior-year period. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results of Operations 

REVENUE

Our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. In the events marketing business, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. We generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2013, our revenue increased by $166.1, or 2.4%, compared to 2012, due to an organic revenue increase of $196.2, or 2.8%, and the effect of net acquisitions of $50.3, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $80.4. We had growth in the domestic market, with our organic revenue increase primarily attributable to net client wins, most notably in the auto and transportation sector, and net higher spending from existing clients, primarily in the healthcare sector, partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom sector. In addition, our organic revenue increase in the domestic market was mainly driven by our events marketing and public relations businesses. In our international market, the organic revenue increase was primarily in the Asia Pacific region, led by Australia and China, and in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil. Also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in the Continental Europe region, across most countries in the market, due to a continued challenging economic climate.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012, our revenue decreased by $58.4, or 0.8%, compared to 2011, due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $147.6, partially offset by an organic revenue increase of $47.4, or 0.7%, and the effect of net acquisitions of $41.8. Our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to new client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in our international markets. We had strong growth in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Australia, Singapore, India and China, and in the Latin America region, predominantly in Brazil. Also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was an

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

increase in the United Kingdom, predominately due to our events marketing business, which benefited from work performed in connection with the London Olympics in the third quarter of 2012. The organic revenue increase in our international markets was throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the retail and technology and telecom sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector due to net client losses in the prior year. Our revenue decreased in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Spain and Italy, due to a continued challenging economic climate. This was partially offset by growth in Germany. In our domestic market, our organic revenue decrease was due to net client losses in the prior year, most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors, and a decline in spending from existing clients, primarily in the retail and health care sectors. Partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market was an organic revenue increase in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors. 

Refer to the segment discussion later in this MD&A for information on changes in revenue by segment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Salaries and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, costs for temporary workers, severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards. Additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership. Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. Factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, the change in our stock price, actual results, and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our staff cost ratio, defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, increased in 2013 to 63.8% from 63.1% in 2012. Salaries and related expenses in 2013 increased by $153.6 compared to 2012, due to an organic increase of $165.7 and the effect of net acquisitions of $28.2, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $40.3. The organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $150.1, primarily due to increases in our workforce in international markets, predominantly in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, as well as in our domestic market at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins, and to a lesser extent, modest wage increases. 

Our staff cost ratio increased in 2012 to 63.1% from 62.8% in 2011. Salaries and related expenses in 2012 decreased by $10.2 compared to 2011, due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $85.6, partially offset by an organic increase of $40.9 and the effect of net acquisitions of $34.5. The organic increase was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $96.4, primarily attributable to increases in our workforce in international regions, most notably in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, and businesses where we had revenue growth, as well as modest wage increases. Our workforce decreased in regions and businesses where we had revenue declines as we were disciplined in managing our workforce. 

17
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

Partially offsetting this organic increase was a reduction in incentive award expense of $51.1, resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets.

The following table details our staff cost ratio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Office and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff, and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our office and general expense ratio, defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, decreased in 2013 to 26.9% from 27.1% in 2012. Office and general expenses in 2013 increased by $30.7 compared to 2012, due to an organic increase of $47.8 and the effect of net acquisitions of $10.2, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $27.3. The organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in occupancy costs and higher production expenses in our domestic market related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2013, partially offset by certain adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations.

Our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2012 to 27.1% from 27.4% in 2011. Office and general expenses in 2012 decreased by $37.1 compared to 2011, due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $40.7 and an organic decrease of $4.8, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of $8.4. The organic decrease was primarily attributable to lower occupancy costs, as we continue to find efficiencies in our real estate portfolio, and professional fees. The organic decrease was partially offset by higher production expenses in our international markets, most notably in the Asia Pacific region and in the United Kingdom, related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2012.

The following table details our office and general expense ratio. All other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses, and, to a lesser extent, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, adjustments for contingent acquisition obligations, foreign currency gains (losses), long-lived asset impairments and other expenses.

Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals), net

The components of the restructuring and other reorganization-related charges, net for 2013 and prior restructuring plans are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we implemented a cost savings initiative (the “2013 Plan”) to better align our cost structure with our revenue, primarily in Continental Europe. In connection with this initiative, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $61.2 comprised of severance and termination costs of $55.9, lease terminations costs of $4.8, and other exit costs of $0.5. All restructuring actions were identified and initiated by the end of 2013, with all actions expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.

The following table presents the 2013 Plan restructuring and other reorganization-related charges, net, and employee headcount reduction for the year ended December 31, 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 2013 Plan includes a planned reduction in workforce of 541 employees across all levels and functions and costs associated with offices that were vacated. We expect these initiatives to generate an estimated annual pre-tax savings of approximately $40 in 2014. 

Net restructuring and other reorganization-related (reversals) charges related to the 2007, 2003 and 2001 restructuring plans for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $(0.6), $(1.2) and $1.0, respectively. 

EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Interest Expense

For 2013, net interest expense decreased by $6.0 as compared to 2012, primarily due to a decrease in cash interest on debt obligations. Cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.75% Notes") in the first quarter of 2013 and redemption of our 10.00% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 (the "10.00% Notes") in July 2013, which were refinanced with debt issued at lower rates in 2012. Non-cash interest expense increased primarily as a result of the retirement of our 4.75% Notes and our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.25% Notes") in the first quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2012, respectively. At retirement, the premiums associated with these Notes, which had reduced interest expense in prior periods, were fully amortized.

19
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

For 2012, net interest expense increased by $5.0 as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in non-cash interest expense. Non-cash interest expense increased since the premium associated with our 4.25% Notes, which we retired in March 2012, which had reduced interest expense in prior periods, was fully amortized. Cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 4.25% Notes, which was offset by lower interest income, primarily in the United States due to lower cash balances.

Other (Expense) Income, net 

Results of operations include certain items that are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt – During 2013, we recorded a charge of $45.2 related to the redemption of our 10.00% Notes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Sales of Businesses and Investments – During 2013, we recognized gains from the sale of marketable securities in the Asia Pacific region within our IAN segment and the sale of investments in our Rabbi Trusts, which was partially offset by a loss from the sale of a business in the United Kingdom within our IAN segment. During 2012, we recognized gains from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook and a business in an international market within our CMG segment, which were partially offset by losses from the sale of businesses within our IAN segment, as well as an adjustment relating to a reserve for a change in estimate in connection with a business disposed of in a prior year. During 2011, we recognized a gain from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, which was partially offset by a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our IAN segment.

Vendor Discounts and Credit Adjustments – In connection with the liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities primarily where the statute of limitations has lapsed, or as a result of differences resulting from settlements with clients or vendors.

Other Income (Expense), net – During 2013, other income (expense), net primarily included a non-cash gain on re-measurement to fair value of an equity interest in an affiliate, located in the Asia Pacific region within our CMG segment, upon acquiring a controlling interest.

INCOME TAXES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income. In 2013, our effective income tax rate of 38.7% was positively impacted by the recognition of losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the settlement of the 2002-2006 New York State audit cycle. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. 

In 2012, our effective income tax rate of 31.6% was positively impacted by the reversals of valuation allowances associated with the Asia Pacific and Continental Europe regions, of $26.2 and $21.8, respectively, as well as by a benefit derived from the deduction of foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment of $19.5 associated with the establishment of a previously unrecorded reserve for a tax contingency for the years 2007 through 2010, losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit. 

20
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

In 2011, our effective income tax rate of 25.8% was positively impacted primarily from the utilization of capital losses to offset nearly all of the $132.2 capital gain realized from the Facebook transaction. The capital gain enabled us to use capital loss carryforwards, on which a 100% valuation allowance had been previously established, and capital losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the 2007-2008 IRS audit cycle, a lower effective income tax rate on non-U.S. operations and the net reversal of valuation allowances, primarily in Europe. The effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by state and local taxes and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. The settlement of the 2007-2008 audit cycle resulted in no cash payment.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $0.62, $1.01 and $1.12 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $0.61, $0.94 and $0.99 per share, respectively.

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013 included a negative impact of $0.12 and $0.11 per share, respectively, from the effects of restructuring and related costs, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013 included a negative impact of $0.06 per share from a loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 included $0.14 and $0.12 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $0.27 and $0.23 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, net of tax. 

Segment Results of Operations 

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2013: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the "Corporate and other" group. 

IAN

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2013, IAN revenue increased by $67.1 compared to 2012, due to an organic revenue increase of $99.9 and the effect of net acquisitions of $40.4, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $73.2. The organic revenue increase in our domestic market was primarily attributable to net client wins, most notably in the auto and transportation sector, and net higher spending from existing clients, primarily in the healthcare sector, partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom and retail sectors. In our international markets, the organic revenue increase was primarily due to net higher spending from existing clients across most client sectors, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, led by Australia, and in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in the Continental Europe region across most countries in the market.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012, IAN revenue decreased by $163.3 compared to 2011, due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $138.7 and an organic revenue decrease of $44.4, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of $19.8. The organic revenue decrease 

21
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

was attributable to a decline in our domestic market due to net client losses in the prior year, most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors, and a decline in spending from existing clients, primarily in the health care and retail sectors. Partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market were increases in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors. In our international markets, our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Australia and India, and in the Latin America region, predominantly in Brazil. The sectors primarily contributing to the international organic revenue increase were the retail and technology and telecom sectors, which was partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, primarily due to a continued challenging economic climate.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1Segment operating income and operating margin exclude approximately $56 of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges. See "Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals), net" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income decreased during 2013 when compared to 2012 due to an increase in salaries and related expenses of $109.5, partially offset by an increase in revenue of $67.1 and a decrease in office and general expenses of $4.3. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help, primarily attributable to an increase in our workforce in certain businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins during 2013. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not occur during 2013, certain adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs.

Operating income decreased during 2012 when compared to 2011 due to a decrease in revenue of $163.3, partially offset by decreases in salaries and related expenses of $69.9 and office and general expenses of $64.8. The decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to a reduction in incentive award expense resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets and, to a lesser extent, lower severance expense. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not occur during 2012, lower occupancy costs and, to a lesser extent, lower professional fees. 

CMG

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2013, CMG revenue increased by $99.0 compared to 2012, primarily due to an organic revenue increase of $96.3. We had growth in the domestic market, with our organic revenue increase primarily due to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients across all disciplines, most notably in our events marketing and public relations businesses. The international organic revenue increase occurred primarily in our public relations business and was predominantly in the Latin America region, mostly notably in Brazil, and in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China. Mostly offsetting the international organic revenue increase was an organic revenue decrease in the United Kingdom, due to a decrease in our events marketing business which in the prior-year included work performed for the London Olympics, and in the Continental Europe region due to a continued challenging economic climate. 

22
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2012, CMG revenue increased by $104.9 compared to 2011, due principally to an organic revenue increase of $91.8. The organic revenue increase was primarily due to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients across all disciplines, primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses. The international organic revenue increase occurred throughout nearly all regions, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, most notably in Australia, Singapore and China, and in the United Kingdom, where our events marketing business benefited from work performed for the London Olympics in the third quarter of 2012. Revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects where we act as principal, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to growth in our public relations and sports marketing businesses.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Segment operating income and operating margin exclude approximately $5 of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges. See "Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals), net" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income increased during 2013 when compared to 2012 due to an increase in revenue of $99.0, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $38.8 and office and general expenses of $36.8. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce across most disciplines, primarily at our public relations business to support business growth. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2013. 

Operating income increased during 2012 when compared to 2011 due to an increase in revenue of $104.9, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $51.2 and office and general expenses of $40.9. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce across all disciplines to support business growth, which resulted in an increase in base salaries and benefits. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2012.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses, as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition, office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. 

Corporate and other expenses increased during 2013 by $3.5 to $140.8 compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses, mainly attributable to higher base salaries, benefits and temporary help, partially offset by lower severance expenses and a decrease in office and general expenses. 

Corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during 2012 by $4.7 to $137.3 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower office and general expenses, partially offset by an increase in temporary help to support our information-technology system-upgrade initiatives.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, non-cash loss related to early extinguishment of debt, and deferred income taxes.

2 Reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2013 was $592.9, which was an increase of $235.7 as compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of $283.6, offset by a decrease in net income. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year, with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters. The improvement in working capital in 2013 was impacted by our media businesses and an ongoing focus on working capital management at our agencies. 

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2012 was $357.2, which was an increase of $83.7 as compared to 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in working capital usage of $66.2. The net working capital usage in 2012 was primarily impacted by our media businesses. 

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. 

Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures of $173.0 relate primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements. We made payments of $61.5 related to acquisitions completed during 2013.

Net cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by the net proceeds of $94.8 received from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook. Capital expenditures of $169.2 primarily related to computer hardware and software, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures increased in 2012 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year. Payments for acquisitions of $145.5 primarily related to payments for new acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2013 primarily related to the purchase of long-term debt, the repurchase of our common stock, and payment of dividends. We redeemed all $600.0 in aggregate principal amount of our 10.00% Notes. In addition, we repurchased 31.8 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $481.8, including fees, and made dividend payments of $126.0 on our common stock.

24
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

Net cash provided by financing activities during 2012 primarily reflected net proceeds from our debt transactions. We issued $300.0 in aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2.25% Notes"), $500.0 in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "3.75% Notes") and $250.0 in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "4.00% Notes"). The proceeds from the issuance of the 4.00% Notes were applied towards the repurchase and redemption of $399.6 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Notes. Offsetting the net proceeds from our debt transactions was the repurchase of 32.7 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $350.5, including fees, and dividend payments of $103.4 on our common stock. 

Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of $94.1 in 2013. The decrease was primarily a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and South African Rand as of December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012.

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of $6.2 in 2012. The decrease was a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Brazilian Real and South African Rand, offset by the U.S. Dollar being weaker than other foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, as of as of December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK

We expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends. 

From time to time, we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

Funding Requirements 

Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock dividends, taxes, debt service, restructuring, and contributions to pension and postretirement plans. Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests. 

Notable funding requirements include: 

•Debt service – Our $350.0 in aggregate principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014 mature on November 15, 2014. The remainder of our debt is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled through 2023. See the table below for the maturity schedule of our long-term debt. 

•Acquisitions – We paid cash of $60.6, which was net of cash acquired of $7.1, for acquisitions completed in 2013. We also paid cash of $30.5 related to acquisitions made in prior years. In addition to potential cash expenditures for new 

25

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately $10.0 in 2014 related to prior-year acquisitions. We may also be required to pay approximately $21.0 in 2014 related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our position, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Restructuring – We paid cash of approximately $11 in connection with restructuring actions we have taken through December 31, 2013. We expect to make cash payments of approximately $45, in 2014, with remaining cash payments to be made through 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements.

3 We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations based on the future performance of the acquired entity. See Note 5 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

4The amounts presented are an estimate due to inherent uncertainty of tax settlements, including the ability to offset liabilities with tax loss carryforwards.

Share Repurchase Program

In February 2012, our Board authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2012 share repurchase program"). In November 2012, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2012 share repurchase program up to $400.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, as a result of the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook. In February 2013, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2013 share repurchase program"). In March 2013, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2013 share repurchase program up to $500.0, excluding fees, of our common stock to be used towards the repurchase of shares resulting from the conversion to common stock of the 4.75% Notes. We fully utilized the 2012 share repurchase program as of the second quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2013, $118.6 remained available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program. 

26
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

On February 14, 2014, we announced that our Board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. The new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program.

We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means. We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods, although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs.

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries. Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. These letters of credit historically have not been drawn upon.

At December 31, 2013, we held $871.4 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries. We have not provided U.S. federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. If in the future we distribute these amounts to the United States, an additional provision for the U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, net of foreign tax credits, could be necessary. 

Credit Agreements

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility. On December 12, 2013, we amended and restated our credit agreement, originally dated as of July 18, 2008 (as amended and restated as of December 12, 2013, the "Credit Agreement"). The amendment extended the Credit Agreement's expiration to December 12, 2018, reduced costs and provides additional flexibility with respect to certain covenants such as restrictions on acquisitions, liens, and subsidiary debt. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,000.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company continues to have the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $200.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. We use our Credit Agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. 

Under the Credit Agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the Eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2013, the applicable margin is 0.275% for base rate advances and 1.275% for Eurocurrency rate advances. Letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0.250%. We also pay a facility fee at an annual rate of 0.225% on the aggregate lending commitment under the Credit Agreement.

The table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of December 31, 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 EBITDA is calculated as defined in the Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement. If we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. If we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility. 

We also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2013, there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was approximately 4.0%.

Cash Pooling 

We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 the amounts netted were $1,415.3 and $1,166.3, respectively.

CAPPED CALL

 In November 2010 we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 4.75% Notes were convertible. In March 2013, we exercised our capped call options and elected net share settlement. We received a total of 1.5 settlement shares from the option counterparties as a result of exercising these options. Our capped call transaction met the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement per Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 14, 2014 are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We are rated investment-grade by both Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings. The most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in February 2013, when Standard & Poor's changed our outlook from positive to stable. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, including, among other things, because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise. For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. 

The majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs. We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses. In general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions. 

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as “out-of-pocket” expenses. These expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges. We record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.

29
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change.

We are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings. A valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance. Conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings. In 2013 we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of $3.2. In 2012 and 2011 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of $57.3 and $32.9, respectively. 

The authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 13 reporting units that were subject to the 2013 annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2013 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units. 

During 2011 and 2012, we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. Qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as pending litigation. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is required to determine the fair value and 

30
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value. Otherwise, no additional testing is required.

For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed. For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value, excluding goodwill. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.

For our 2013 and 2012 annual impairment tests, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for six and nine reporting units and performed the first step of a two-step quantitative impairment test for seven and two reporting units, respectively. In 2013, we performed a quantitative impairment test for three of the seven reporting units due to a reorganization of their reporting unit structure. For the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, macroeconomic conditions and entity-specific factors such as client wins and losses. Based on this assessment, we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment, it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value; therefore, no additional testing was required.

The 2013 and 2012 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.

These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For the 2013 test, the discount rates we used for our reporting units tested were between 10.0% and 13.5%, and the terminal value growth rate for all seven of our reporting units tested was 3.0%. The terminal value growth rate represents the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy. For the 2013 test, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 4.0% and 5.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

We also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 0.25% and increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 0.25% and decreases discount rates by 0.5%. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test. 

The table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the 2013 and 2012 annual impairment tests. Our results of the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that for the 2013 test there was one reporting unit and for the 2012 test there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range. The table below displays the range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the 2013 and 2012 annual impairment tests. For the 2013 test, using the low of the valuation range, there were two reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%, but not less that 0%. For the 2012 test, using the low of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%.

 Based on the analysis described above, for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of October 1, 2013, because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values.

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. These assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. Management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. We determine our discount rates for our domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond yield curve approach. Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. In countries where

markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate. 

For the year ended December 31, 2013, a discount rate of 4.00% was used for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weighted-average discount rate of 4.32% for the significant foreign pension plans to calculate 2013 net pension and postretirement benefit costs. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2013 net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately $1.0, respectively.

As of December 31, 2013, we used a discount rate of 4.85% for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weighted-average discount rate of 4.29% for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2013 benefit obligation by approximately $26.0 and $27.0, respectively. 

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.

For 2013, the weighted-average expected rates of return of 7.00% and 5.24% were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2014, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 7.00% and 6.18% for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. Changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. A lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2013 net pension cost by approximately $1.0, respectively.
