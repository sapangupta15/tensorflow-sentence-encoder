General

Equity Residential (“EQR”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. ERP Operating Limited Partnership (“ERPOP”), an Illinois limited partnership, was formed in May 1993 to conduct the multifamily residential property business of Equity Residential. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT. References to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean collectively EQR, ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EQR and/or ERPOP. References to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ERPOP.

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2012 owned an approximate 95.9% ownership interest in ERPOP. All of the Company's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR issues public equity from time to time but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. 

As of December 31, 2012, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 403 properties located in 13 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 115,370 apartment units.

Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies

The Company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital. 

We seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets (our core markets) that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation. We are focused primarily on the six core coastal, high barrier to entry markets of Boston, New York, Washington DC, Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. These markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents:

▪High barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is difficult or costly to build new apartment properties, creating limits on new supply; 

▪High home ownership costs;

▪Strong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth, which in turn leads to high demand 

7
for our apartments;

▪Urban core locations with an attractive quality of life and higher wage job categories leading to high resident demand and retention; and

▪Favorable demographics contributing to a larger pool of target residents with a high propensity to rent apartments. 

Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. Revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties, cost-effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration. While we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends. 

We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to sign their leases, review their accounts and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line.

Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt, sales of properties and joint venture agreements. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. The Company may acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities. The Company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings. The Company has also, in the past, converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business.

Over the past several years, the Company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entry/non-core markets to high barrier to entry/core markets. Since 2005, the Company has sold over 133,000 apartment units primarily in its non-core markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately $11.1 billion, acquired over 44,000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately $10.3 billion and began approximately $3.0 billion of development projects in its core markets. We are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas (our core markets): Boston, New York, Washington DC, Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. We also have investments (in the aggregate about 15.8% of our NOI at December 31, 2012) in other markets including South Florida, Denver and New England (excluding Boston) but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets. Further, we are in the process of exiting Atlanta, Phoenix, Orlando and Jacksonville as we raise capital to complete the Archstone transaction. 

As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets. As of December 31, 2012, no single metropolitan area accounted for more than 15.9% of our NOI, though no guarantee can be made that NOI concentration may not increase in the future. 

We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. We provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the property and its improvements, equipment and appliances. We actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. We monitor our employees' engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores. 

We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. We have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including investment activities, development, property operations and property management activities. With its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation. When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting, HVAC and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption.

Competition

All of the Company's properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company's ability to lease apartment 

8
units at its properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Company's managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to competition.

Debt and Equity Activity

EQR issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of ERPOP. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. In addition, ERPOP issues OP Units and preference interests ("Preference Units") from time to time.

Credit Facilities

EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. EQR guarantees the Operating Partnership's revolving credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

In July 2011, the Company replaced its then existing $1.425 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in February 2012 with a new $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on July 13, 2014, subject to a one-year extension option exercisable by the Company. The Company had the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. On January 6, 2012, the Company amended this credit facility to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million to $1.75 billion with all other terms, including the July 13, 2014 maturity date, remaining the same. The interest rate on advances under the credit facility was generally LIBOR plus a spread (1.15%) and the Company paid an annual facility fee of 0.2%. Both the spread and the facility fee were dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long-term debt. On January 11, 2013, the Company replaced its existing $1.75 billion credit facility with a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing April 1, 2018. The interest rate on advances under the new credit facility will be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 1.05%) and an annual facility fee (currently 15 basis points). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the Company's long-term debt.

As of February 15, 2012, the amount available on the $2.5 billion credit facility was $2.47 billion (net of $30.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit) and there was no amount outstanding. As of December 31, 2012, the amount available on the $1.75 billion credit facility was $1.72 billion (net of $30.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit) and there was no amount outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the weighted average interest rate was 1.35%. As of December 31, 2011, the amount available on the $1.25 billion credit facility was $1.22 billion (net of $31.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit) and there was no amount outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate was 1.42%.

Archstone Transaction

On November 26, 2012, the Company and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. ("AvalonBay" or "AVB") (NYSE:AVB) entered into a contract with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") to acquire the assets and liabilities of Archstone Enterprise LP ("Archstone"), which consists principally of a portfolio of high-quality apartment properties in major markets in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will acquire approximately 60% of Archstone's assets and liabilities and AvalonBay will acquire approximately 40% of Archstone's assets and liabilities. The Company will acquire approximately 75 operating properties, four properties under development and several land parcels to be held for future development for approximately $8.9 billion which will consist of cash of approximately $2.0 billion, 34,468,085 Common Shares and the assumption of the Company's portion of the liabilities related to the Archstone assets (other than certain liabilities owed to Lehman and certain transaction expenses).
