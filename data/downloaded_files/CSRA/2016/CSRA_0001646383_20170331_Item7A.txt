Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of funds invested in U.S. government insured money-market accounts and prime money-market funds. As of March 31, 2017 and April 1, 2016, we had $126 million and $130 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. Although we have hedged a significant portion of our interest rate exposure as of March 2017, the interest expense associated with our term loans and any loans under our revolving credit facility will vary with market rates.

Our exposure to financial risk from changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt will impact our senior secured loan facilities. A hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would have increased the interest expense incurred under our senior secured loan facilities by approximately $13 million in fiscal year 2017 and likewise decreased our income from continuing operations before taxes and cash flows.

The return on our cash and cash equivalents balance as of both March 31, 2017 and April 1, 2016 was less than 1%. Therefore, although investment interest rates may continue to decrease in the future, the corresponding impact to our interest income, and likewise to our income and cash flow, would not be material.

We have not entered into any hedging transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
