MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi reported balanced operating results for full-year 2017, reflecting continued momentum across businesses and geographies, notably many of those where Citi has been making investments. 

During 2017, Citi had revenue and loan growth and positive operating leverage as well as operating margin expansion in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and every region in Global Consumer Banking (GCB). Citi also continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting in an operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2017. Results in 2017 also included an updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which impacted the tax line within Corporate/Other, as well as the tax lines in North America GCB and ICG (for additional information on this updated estimate, see “Impact of Tax Reform” below).

In 2017, Citi increased the amount of capital returned to shareholders, while each of its key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see “Capital” below). During the year, Citi returned approximately $17.1 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends and repurchased approximately 214 million common shares as outstanding common shares declined 7% from the prior year. 

Going into 2018, while economic sentiment has improved and the macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses and future results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2018, see each respective business’s results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below. Despite these risks and uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2017 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders.

2017 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, compared to net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per share, in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while earnings per share increased 13%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average shares outstanding. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of Tax Reform are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of Tax Reform provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) For additional information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform,” “Risk Factors,” 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citigroup revenues of $71.4 billion in 2017 increased 2%, driven by 6% aggregate growth in ICG and GCB, partially offset by a 40% decrease in Corporate/Other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans increased 7% to $667 billion versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period loans grew 5%, as 9% growth in ICG and 4% growth in GCB was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses). Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 3% to $960 billion versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s deposits were up 1%, as a 2% increase in ICG deposits was partially offset by a decline in Corporate/ Other deposits, and GCB deposits were largely unchanged.

Expenses

Citigroup operating expenses were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. Year-over-year, ICG operating expenses were up 3% and GCB operating expenses increased 2%, while Corporate/Other operating expenses declined 24%, all versus the prior year.

Cost of Credit

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.5 billion increased 7% from the prior year. The increase was mostly driven by a $515 million increase in net credit losses, primarily in North America GCB, partially offset by a lower provision for benefits and claims due to continued legacy asset divestitures within Corporate/Other. The net loan loss reserve build of $266 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $217 million in the prior year. The increase was mostly due to volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of loan loss reserve builds related to forward-looking net credit loss expectations, all in the North America cards portfolios, partially offset by a higher net reserve release in ICG.

Net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. Consumer net credit losses increased 11% to

$6.7 billion, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the North America cards portfolios and the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio. The increase in consumer net credit losses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other. Corporate net credit losses 

6

decreased 26% to $379 million, largely driven by improvement in the energy sector.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital

Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 12.4% and 14.1% as of December 31, 2017 (based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets), respectively, compared to 12.6% and 14.2% as of December 31, 2016 (based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). The decline in regulatory capital reflected the return of capital to common shareholders and an approximately $6 billion reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital due to the impact of Tax Reform, partially offset by earnings growth. Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, on a fully implemented basis, was 6.7%, compared to 7.2% as of December 31, 2016. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, including the impact of Tax Reform on its capital ratios, see “Capital Resources” below. 

Global Consumer Banking

GCB net income decreased 21%. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, GCB net income decreased 6%, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Operating expenses were $17.8 billion, up 2%, as higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings. 

GCB revenues of $32.7 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, driven by growth across all regions. North America GCB revenues increased 3% to $20.3 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. Citi-branded cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as a higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given higher interest rates. Citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion increased 1% versus the prior year, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. Retail banking revenues increased 1% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. Excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion were up 9% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.

North America GCB average deposits of $184 billion increased 1% year-over-year, average retail loans of $56 billion grew 3% and assets under management of $60 billion grew 14%. Average Citi-branded card loans of $85 billion increased 15%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $320 billion increased 28% versus the prior year. Average Citi retail services loans of $46 billion increased 4% versus the prior 

year, while retail services purchase sales of $81 billion were up 2%. For additional information on the results of operations of North America GCB for 2017, see “Global Consumer Banking—North America GCB” below.

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations in certain EMEA countries)) increased 6% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB revenues increased 5% versus the prior year. Latin America GCB revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by growth in loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads. Asia GCB revenues increased 5% (4% excluding modest gains on the sales of merchant acquiring businesses in the second and fourth quarters of 2017) versus the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in cards revenues and wealth management revenues, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. For additional information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB for 2017, including the impact of FX translation, see “Global Consumer Banking—Latin America GCB” and “Global Consumer Banking—Asia GCB” below. 

Year-over-year, international GCB average deposits of $122 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $87 billion were largely unchanged, assets under management of $101 billion increased 14%, average card loans of $24 billion increased 5% and card purchase sales of $98 billion increased 7%, all excluding the impact of FX translation.

Institutional Clients Group

ICG net income decreased 5%. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, ICG net income increased 16%, driven by higher revenues and a small benefit to cost of credit (compared to a $486 million cost of credit in the prior year), partially offset by higher operating expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 3% to $19.6 billion, as higher compensation, investments and volume-related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.

ICG revenues were $35.7 billion in 2017, up 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 16% increase in Banking revenues. Markets and securities services were largely unchanged versus the prior year. The increase in Banking revenues included the impact of $133 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $594 million in the prior year.

Banking revenues of $18.7 billion (excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 12%, driven by solid growth across all products. Investment banking revenues of $5.2 billion increased 20% versus the prior year, reflecting wallet share gains across all products. Advisory revenues increased 11% to $1.1 billion, equity underwriting revenues increased 68% to $1.1 billion and debt underwriting revenues increased 13% to $3.0 billion, all versus the prior year.

Private bank revenues increased 14% from the prior year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved spreads. Corporate lending revenues increased 59% to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower hedging costs, 

7

as well as the prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.5 billion increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved spreads, with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.

Markets and securities services revenues of $17.1 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in fixed income markets and equity markets revenues was offset by an increase in securities services revenues as well as a $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. Fixed income markets revenues of $12.1 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, reflecting low volatility, as well as the comparison to higher revenues from a more robust trading environment in the prior year following the vote in the U.K. in favor of its withdrawal from the European Union, as well as the U.S. election. Equity markets revenues of $2.7 billion decreased 2% from the prior year, driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event. Excluding this item, equity markets revenues increased 2% from the prior year, driven by growth in client balances and higher investor client revenue. Securities services revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for 2017, see “Institutional Clients Group” below.

Corporate/Other

Corporate/Other net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Corporate/Other net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. Operating expenses of $3.8 billion declined 24% from the prior-year period, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses.

Corporate/Other revenues were $3.1 billion, down 40% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets as well as the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. 

Corporate/Other end-of-period assets of $77 billion decreased 25% from the prior year, reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets as well as the impact of Tax Reform, which reduced assets by approximately $20 billion. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for 2017, see “Corporate/Other” below.

Impact of Tax Reform

Citi’s full-year 2017 results included the updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, recorded within Corporate/Other, North America GCB and ICG related to the enactment of Tax Reform, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This updated estimate resulted in a downward adjustment to fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results, as well as changes in the segments where the impact was recorded (previously, the entire charge was recorded in Corporate/Other), from those reported on January 16, 2018, by an aggregate of $594 million due to refinements of original estimates. The approximate $6 billion reduction in CET1 Capital due to the impact of Tax Reform was unchanged.

This charge was composed of a $12.4 billion remeasurement of Citi’s deferred tax assets (DTAs) due to the reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate and the change to a quasi-territorial tax system (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes” below), a $7.9 billion valuation allowance against Citi’s foreign tax credit (FTC) carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related to its non-U.S. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in Citi’s FTC carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The financial results in the table below disclose the as-reported GAAP results for 2017 and 2016, the impact of Tax Reform and the 2017 adjusted results excluding the impact of Tax Reform. The charge related to Tax Reform is reflected in Citi’s results throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise noted. 

The final impact of Tax Reform may differ from the estimate due to, among other things, changes in assumptions 

made by Citigroup and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. For more information on possible changes to the estimated impact related to Tax Reform, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING

Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consists of consumer banking businesses in North America, Latin America (consisting of Citi’s consumer banking business in Mexico) and Asia. GCB provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, including commercial banking, and Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above). GCB is focused on its priority markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia with 2,451 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions as of December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, GCB had approximately $429 billion in assets and $307 billion in deposits.

 GCB’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies.

NORTH AMERICA GCB

North America GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, Citi-branded cards products and Citi retail services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the U.S. North America GCB’s U.S. cards product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the Citi Double Cash, Thank You and Value cards) and co-branded cards (including, among others, American Airlines and Costco) within Citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label relationships (including, among others, Sears, The Home Depot, Best Buy and Macy’s) within Citi retail services. 

As previously announced, the Hilton Honors co-brand credit card partnership with Citi was scheduled to terminate as of year-end 2017. On October 23, 2017, Citi signed an agreement to sell the Hilton credit card portfolio (approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding loan balances in Citi-branded cards as of December 31, 2017) to American Express. In connection with the sale agreement, the existing partnership was extended through the closing date. The sale was completed on January 30, 2018, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million, which approximates one year of revenues from the portfolio. The sale will impact North America GCB’s quarterly comparisons in 2018. 

As of December 31, 2017, North America GCB’s 694 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also as of December 31, 2017, North America GCB had approximately 9.2 million retail banking customer accounts, $56.0 billion in retail banking loans and $182.5 billion in deposits. In addition, North America GCB had approximately 121 million Citi-branded and Citi retail services credit card accounts with $139.7 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

2017 vs. 2016 

Net income decreased 37% and was impacted by an estimated $750 million non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax Reform (for additional information, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above). Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income decreased 14% due to higher cost of credit and slightly higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. 

Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding the decline in mortgage revenues (down of 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, continued growth in loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. The decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of Citi’s mortgage servicing rights. 

Cards revenues increased 3%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio (completed June 17, 2016), as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given the higher interest rates. Average loans grew 15% and purchase sales grew 28%. North America GCB expects that additional terms in certain partnership contracts that go into effect in 2018 will negatively impact Citi-branded cards revenues going forward. 

Citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed renewal and extension of certain partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. Average loans grew 4% and purchase sales grew 2%. 

Expenses increased 1%, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Also included in expenses is an $80 million provision for remediation costs related to a Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act) matter (for additional information, see “Corporate/Other” below and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Provisions increased 24% from the prior year, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net loan loss reserve build.

Net credit losses increased 22% to $4.8 billion, largely driven by higher net credit losses in Citi-branded cards (up 28% to $2.4 billion) and Citi retail services (up 19% to $2.2 billion). The increase in net credit losses primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio in Citi-branded cards. 

The net loan loss reserve build in 2017 was $873 million (compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year), driven by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as 

well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets leading to higher inherent credit loss expectations, primarily in Citi retail services.

For additional information on North America GCB’s retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

2016 vs. 2015 

Net income decreased by 23% due to significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail banking and Citi retail services. Retail banking revenues decreased 2%. Excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on sale of branches in Texas in the first quarter of 2015, retail banking revenues were largely unchanged, as lower mortgage revenues were offset by continued volume growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average checking deposits (9%). 

Cards revenues increased 2%. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as well as volume growth, partially offset by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and the impact of higher promotional balances. Citi retail services revenues decreased 1%, as the impact of the renewal and extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were partially offset by modest growth in average loans. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily due to the Costco acquisition, continued investment spending, volume growth, higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and related costs. 

Provisions increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss reserve build, compared to a loan loss reserve release in the prior year, and higher net credit losses. The net loan loss reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, as well as volume growth and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases in 2015 as credit normalized. The reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party debt collections. 

The increase in net credit losses was driven by increases in cards and retail banking. In retail banking, net credit losses grew 37%, primarily due to an increase related to Citi’s energy and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves. In Citi-branded cards, net credit losses increased 1%, driven by volume growth, including the impact of Costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections. In Citi retail services, net credit losses increased 6%, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections.

LATIN AMERICA GCB

Latin America GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses in Mexico through Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks. 

At December 31, 2017, Latin America GCB had 1,479 retail branches in Mexico, with approximately 27.7 million retail banking customer accounts, $19.9 billion in retail banking loans and $27.1 billion in deposits. In addition, the business had approximately 5.6 million Citi-branded card accounts with $5.4 billion in outstanding loan balances.

On November 27, 2017, Citi entered into an agreement to sell its Mexico asset management business reported within Latin America GCB. For additional information on this sale, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The discussion of the results of operations for Latin America GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2017 vs. 2016 

Net income decreased 5%, primarily driven by higher credit costs and expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher revenues in

retail banking.

Retail banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in volumes, including an increase in average deposits (8%), average loans (6%), reflecting growth across most portfolios, an increase in assets under management (6%), as well as improved deposit spreads, driven by higher interest rates. Cards revenues were largely unchanged, as continued improvement in full-rate revolving loans in the second half of 2017 was offset by a higher cost to fund non-revolving loans. Purchase sales grew 8% and average card loans grew 5%. 

Expenses increased 4%, as ongoing investment spending and business growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. Citi continues to execute on its investment plans for Citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms. 

Provisions increased 12%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses (8%) and a $42 million increase in the net loan loss reserve build, largely reflecting volume growth and seasoning. The increase in the loan loss reserve build was also driven by a Mexico earthquake-related loan loss reserve build in the third quarter of 2017 (approximately $25 million).

For additional information on potential macroeconomic

and geopolitical challenges and other risks facing Latin

America GCB, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

2016 vs. 2015 

Net income increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher credit costs.

Revenues increased 1%, driven by overall volume growth, largely offset by the absence of a $160 million gain on sale related to the sale of the merchant acquiring business in Mexico in 2015. Excluding this gain, revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher revenues in retail banking, partially offset by lower revenues in cards. Retail banking revenues increased 3%. Excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business, revenues increased 9%, driven by volume growth. Cards revenues decreased 4%, driven by the impact of higher payment rates, partially offset by increased purchase sales. 

Expenses decreased 2%, as lower legal and related expenses, the impact of business divestitures and ongoing efficiency savings were partially offset by higher repositioning charges and ongoing investment spending. 

Provisions increased 1%, driven by a higher net loan loss reserve build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. The net loan loss reserve build increased $56 million, largely due to volume growth. Net credit losses decreased 5%, largely reflecting continued lower net credit losses in the cards portfolio, partially offset by higher net credit losses in the personal loan portfolio.

ASIA GCB

Asia GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable.

(2)Reflects the impact of FX translation into U.S. dollars at the 2017 average exchange rates for all periods presented.

(3)Presentation of this metric excluding FX translation is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The discussion of the results of operations for Asia GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2017 vs. 2016 

Net income increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards and wealth management revenues, partially offset by continued lower retail lending revenues.

Retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the continued improvement in wealth management revenues, partially offset by the repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. Wealth management revenues increased due to improvement in investor sentiment, stronger equity markets and increases in assets under management (18%) and investment sales (38%). Average deposits increased 5%. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the lower retail lending revenues (down 4%), reflecting continued lower average loans (1%) due to the continued optimization of this portfolio away from lower yielding mortgage loans to focus on growing higher-return personal loans.

Cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales, both of which benefited from the previously disclosed portfolio acquisition in Australia in 2017, as well as modest gains in 2017 related to sales of merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.

 Expenses increased 2%, resulting from volume growth and ongoing investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provisions decreased 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in net credit losses. 

For additional information on Asia GCB’s retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards portfolio, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

2016 vs. 2015 

Net income decreased 9%, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses.

Revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher cards revenues. Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity, modestly lower investment assets under management and a decline in average loans. The decline in revenues was partially offset by growth in deposit volumes and higher insurance revenues. Cards revenues increased 1%, driven by continued improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued stabilizing payment rates.

Expenses increased 2%, primarily due to higher repositioning costs, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provisions were largely unchanged as lower net loan loss reserve releases were offset by lower net credit losses, primarily in the commercial portfolio.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Banking and Markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees and Investment banking. Revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions (for additional information on Principal transactions revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid to customers on deposits and long- and short-term debt, is recorded as Net interest revenue.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions. 

ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. ICG does not separately track the impact on total Markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the Markets businesses at an aggregate level.

In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2017, ICG had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $640 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses—securities services and issuer services—managed approximately $17.4 trillion of assets under custody compared to $15.2 trillion at the end of the prior-year period.

ICG Revenue Details—Excluding CVA/DVA and Gains (Losses) on Loan Hedges

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes the impact of CVA/DVA for 2015. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2017 vs. 2016 

Net income decreased 5% and was impacted by an estimated $2.0 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax Reform (for additional information, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above). Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income increased 16%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.

•Revenues increased 7%, reflecting a 16% increase in Banking (including the losses on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of the losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 12%, driven by solid growth across all products. Markets and securities services were largely unchanged, as growth in securities services revenues (increase of 8%) as well as the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business were offset by a 6% decrease in fixed income markets and a 2% decrease in equity markets revenues.

Within Banking:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 7%, reflecting growth across all regions that was balanced across both net interest and fee income. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. The trade business experienced modest revenue growth, as continued focus on high-quality loan growth was largely offset by industry-wide tightening of spreads. Average deposit balances increased 4%, while average trade loans increased 5% (4% excluding the impact of FX translation).

•Corporate lending revenues increased 59%. Excluding the impact of losses on loans hedges, revenues increased 12%, driven by lower hedging costs and the absence of a prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction.

•Private bank revenues increased 14%, reflecting strength across all regions and products. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher loan and deposit volumes, 

higher deposit spreads and increased managed investments and capital markets activity.

Within Markets and securities services:

•Fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%, with lower revenues in all regions, primarily due to low volatility as well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior year from a more robust trading environment following the vote in the U.K. in favor of its withdrawal from the European Union, as well as the U.S. election. The decline in revenues was driven by lower net interest revenue (decreased 22%), largely due to higher funding costs and a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. The decline was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenues and commissions and fees revenues. 

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower G10 rates and currencies revenues. Despite the challenging trading environment, corporate client revenues in rates and currencies across the global network remained strong. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading environment in the current year given low volatility, driving lower credit markets and commodities revenues, particularly in North America, partially offset by higher municipals revenues, as well as higher securitized markets revenues.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Securities services revenues increased 8%. Excluding the impact of the prior year’s divestiture of a private equity fund services business, revenues increased 12%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue due to a more favorable rate environment.

Expenses increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions improved $501 million, driven by a net loan loss release of $380 million (compared to a net release of $30 million in the prior year) and a 29% decline in net credit 

27

losses. The increase in net loan loss reserve releases was driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well as a favorable credit environment, stability in commodity prices and continued improvement in the portfolio. The decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single client event in the fourth quarter noted above. 

2016 vs. 2015 

Net income increased 5%, primarily driven by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.

•Revenues were largely unchanged, reflecting higher revenues in Markets and securities services (increase of 6%), driven by fixed income markets, offset by lower revenues in Banking (decrease of 4% including the gains (losses) on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by treasury and trade solutions and the private bank. 

Within Banking:

•Investment banking revenues decreased 6%, largely reflecting the overall industry-wide slowdown in activity levels in equity underwriting and advisory during the first half of 2016. Advisory revenues decreased 9%, reflecting strong performance in 2015. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 31%, primarily reflecting the lower market activity. Debt underwriting revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher market activity reflecting a favorable interest rate environment.

•Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 6%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth across most regions. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes and deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. Trade revenues increased modestly due to loan growth as well as spread improvements. End-of-period deposit balances increased 5% (6% excluding the impact of FX translation), while average trade loans decreased 2% (1% excluding the impact of FX translation).

•Corporate lending revenues decreased 48%. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 6%. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges and FX translation, revenues decreased 1%, mostly reflecting the adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction, spread compression and higher hedging costs, partially offset by higher average loans.

•Private bank revenues increased 5%, reflecting growth in loan volumes and improved deposit spreads, partially offset by lower capital markets activity and lower managed investments revenues.

Within Markets and securities services:

•Fixed income markets revenues increased 14%, with higher revenues in all regions, largely driven by both higher principal transactions revenues (up 22%) and other revenues (up 79%). The increase in principal transactions revenues was primarily due to higher rates and currencies revenues and higher spread products revenues. Other revenues increased mainly due to foreign currency losses in 2015. Rates and currencies revenues grew 22%, primarily due to the more favorable trading environment and higher client revenues following the vote in the U.K. and the U.S. election. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 3%, due to lower securitized products revenues, driven by the impact of significantly lower liquidity in the market in the first quarter of 2016.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Securities services revenues increased 2%. Excluding the

impact of FX translation, revenues increased 5%, driven

by EMEA, primarily reflecting increased client activity, a

modest gain on the sale of a private equity fund services

business in the first quarter of 2016, higher deposit

volumes and improved spreads. The increase in revenues

was partially offset by the absence of revenues from

divestitures. Excluding the impact of FX translation and

divestitures, revenues increased 6%.

Expenses decreased 1% as a benefit from FX translation and efficiency savings were partially offset by higher compensation expense and higher repositioning charges.

Provisions decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of $748 million in the prior year). The significant decline in loan loss reserve builds was related to energy and energy-related exposures and was driven by stabilization of commodities as oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016. The decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of previously established loan loss reserves. 

28

CORPORATE/OTHER

Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, Corporate Treasury, certain North America and international legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on Corporate/Other, see “Citigroup Segments” above). At December 31, 2017, Corporate/Other had $77 billion in assets, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 23% from September 30, 2017. The decrease in assets included an approximate $20 billion decline in DTAs during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the impact of Tax Reform.

2017 vs. 2016 

The net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the estimated $19.8 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of Tax Reform (for additional information, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above). Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit. 

Revenues declined 40%, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. Revenues included approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 million charge related to the exit of Citi’s U.S. mortgage servicing operations in the quarter.

Expenses declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses, partially offset by approximately $100 million in episodic expenses primarily related to the exit of the U.S. mortgage servicing operations. Also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million provision for remediation costs related to a CARD Act matter (for additional information, see “North America GCB” above and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Citi believes the aggregate approximately $335 million provision (including the $80 million provision in North America GCB) to be sufficient for Citi’s planned remediation.

Provisions decreased $244 million to a net benefit of $175 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. Net credit losses declined 66% to $149 million, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of the North America mortgage portfolio. The provision for benefits and claims declined by $105 million, primarily due to lower insurance activity. The net reserve release declined by $147 million to $317 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the legacy North America mortgage portfolio and divestitures.

2016 vs. 2015 

Net income was $498 million, compared to net income of $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues and a higher effective tax rate in 2016 due to the absence of certain tax benefits in 2015. 

Revenues decreased 52%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of legacy assets and lower net gains on sales, particularly the sales of OneMain Financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Expenses decreased 32%, reflecting the sales and run-off of assets, lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning costs.

29

 Provisions decreased 95% due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims (decrease of 84%) due to lower insurance activity. Net credit losses declined 67%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures and continued credit improvements in North America mortgages. 

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)

The selling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has been the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. regulators and the U.K. Supreme Court. 

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI being unsuitable for the customer. Redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest, together with compensatory interest of 8%. 

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.K. Supreme Court issued a ruling in a case (Plevin) involving PPI pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the PPI contract, that the PPI contract at issue in the case was “unfair” due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof. 

In addition, the FCA released a policy statement related to PPI that (i) set a deadline of August 29, 2019 by which consumers must file PPI claims, (ii) provides for the launch of FCA-led marketing campaigns to inform consumers of this deadline, (iii) set new rules and guidance for the handling of PPI complaints in light of the Supreme Court’s decision on Plevin and (iv) requires all firms to contact all previously rejected customers who may be able to complain under the new “Plevin” rule (the Plevin Customer Contact Exercise). Citi completed the Plevin Customer Contact Exercise during the fourth quarter of 2017. The FCA-led marketing campaigns began in August 2017 and will continue through the August 2019 deadline. The level of PPI claims also continues to be influenced by the solicitation activity of Claims Management Companies (CMCs).

During 2017, Citi increased its PPI reserves by approximately $109 million (with $105 million recorded in Corporate/Other and $4 million recorded in Discontinued operations). The increase for full-year 2017 compared to an increase of $134 million during 2016 and was primarily due to the ongoing level of PPI claims.

Citi’s year-end 2017 PPI reserve was $213 million, compared to $228 million as of December 31, 2016.

Additional reserving actions, if any, in 2018 will largely depend on the level of customer claims in response to the FCA-led marketing campaigns and the level of ongoing CMC activity.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities; 

•providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate tax laws and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as business and asset dispositions.

During 2017, Citi returned a total of $17.1 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 214 million common shares) and dividends. 

Capital Management

Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee, where applicable. For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Stress Testing—Component of Capital Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are primarily models based, include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets. Conversely, the Standardized Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets and generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are derived on a generally consistent basis under both approaches. 

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed Capital Conservation Buffer and, for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, also a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. In December 2017, the Federal Reserve Board voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0%. 

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches 

banking organizations to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report (as well as measure compliance against) the lower of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.

33

GSIB Surcharge

The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, and would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses) should the expanded buffer be breached to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the expanded buffer is breached.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of a GSIB is based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories are composed of multiple indicators also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total. 

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB under the established methodology is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and will be subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance used to identify a GSIB. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Moreover, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. Effective for 2017 and thereafter, the GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 2017 will be based on 2016 systemic indicator data). Generally, the surcharge derived under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than derived under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2018 would not become effective until January 1, 2020). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 31, 2018 would become effective January 1, 2019).

The following table sets forth Citi’s GSIB surcharge as derived under method 1 and method 2 for 2017 and 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2017 and 2016 was 3.0% and 3.5%, respectively, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2018 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its method 1 GSIB surcharge, and as such Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2019 will not exceed 3.0%, and Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2020 is not expected to exceed 3.0%. 

Transition Provisions

The U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-outs”), including with respect to substantially all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, and non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities and certain subordinated debt issuances). Moreover, the GSIB surcharge, Capital Conservation Buffer, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer (currently 0%), commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. With the exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities, which do not fully phase-out until January 1, 2022, and the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge, which do not fully phase-in until January 1, 2019, all other transition provisions will be entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios by January 1, 2018. Citi considers all of these transition provisions as being fully implemented on January 1, 2019 (full implementation), with the inclusion of the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge. 

The following chart sets forth the transitional progression from January 1, 2016 to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of the regulatory capital components (i.e., inclusive of the mandatory 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as an estimated 3.0% GSIB surcharge) comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.

The following chart presents the transition arrangements (phase-in and phase-out) from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2018 under the U.S. Basel III rules for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions relative to Citi. 

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions for all intangible assets other than goodwill and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); and excess over 10%/15% limitations for deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs. Goodwill (including goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions) is fully deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. The amount of all other intangible assets, aside from MSRs, not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 100%, as are the excess over the 10%/15% limitations for DTAs arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs through December 31, 2017. Commencing January 1, 2018, the amount of temporary difference DTAs, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 250%. 

(2)Includes the phase-in of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital adjustment for cumulative unrealized net gains (losses) related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to Citi’s own creditworthiness; and the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital deductions related to DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards and defined benefit pension plan net assets; 

(3)Includes the phase-out from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of adjustments related to net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities; unrealized gains on AFS equity securities; net unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI); and defined benefit plans liability adjustment.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi, as with principally all U.S. banking organizations, is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Advanced Approaches banking organizations are additionally required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Effective January 1, 2018, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, and their subsidiary insured depository institutions, including Citi and Citibank, are subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2.0% leverage buffer for U.S. GSIBs in addition to the stated 3.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement in the U.S. Basel III rules. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 2.0% leverage buffer, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Accordingly, U.S. GSIBs are effectively subject to a 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement. Citi is required to be compliant with this higher effective minimum ratio requirement on January 1, 2018.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework

The U.S. Basel III rules revised the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions in certain respects. 

In general, the PCA regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,” 

(ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) undercapitalized,” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized,” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0%, effective January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning

Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: 

•The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process, and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution. 

•Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board, the financial companies, and the general public, how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under company-developed scenarios.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under three supervisory scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework and the transition arrangements under the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely. Beginning in 2018, CCAR incorporates the Supplementary Leverage ratio. Accordingly, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to demonstrate an ability to maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio in excess of the stated minimum requirement for all quarters of the 2018 CCAR planning horizon.

For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory Standards 

Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 

Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2017, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), are 7.25%, 8.75% and 10.75%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.5% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), were 6.0%, 7.5% and 9.5%, respectively.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding

company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels. 

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citi as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

(2)In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. This amount relates to securities that were previously transferred from AFS to HTM, and non-credit related factors such as changes in interest rates and liquidity spreads for HTM securities with other-than-temporary impairment. 

(3)The transition arrangements for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions impacting Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital are set forth above in the chart entitled “Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions.”

(4)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(5)The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules. 

(6)Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(8)Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, none of these assets were in excess of the 10%/15% limitations. At December 31, 2016, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. 

(9)Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(10)Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013.

(11)50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(12)Effective January 1, 2016, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 Capital, but are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital subject to full phase-out by January 1, 2022. Non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital in an amount up to 50% and 60% during 2017 and 2016, respectively, of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014, in accordance with the transition arrangements for non-qualifying capital instruments under the U.S. Basel III rules.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Retail exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in qualifying revolving (cards) exposures attributable to seasonal holiday spending. Retail exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 principally resulting from residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, and divestitures of certain legacy assets. 

(2)Wholesale exposures increased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to corporate loan growth. The increase in wholesale exposures during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was partially offset by annual updates to model parameters.

(3)Repo-style transactions decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to improved portfolio credit quality. Repo-style transactions increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased activity and a decline in portfolio credit quality.

(4)Securitization exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased activity. Securitization exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 principally as a result of certain securitization exposures becoming subject to deduction from Tier 1 Capital under the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act.

(5)OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to decreases in trade volume and changes in fair value. OTC derivatives decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to changes in fair value and improved portfolio credit quality. 

(6)Derivatives CVA decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by decreased volatility and exposure reduction.

(7)Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. Other exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform. For additional information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above. 

(8)Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA. 

(9)Risk levels increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increases in exposures subject to securitization charges and incremental risk charges, partially offset by a decrease in exposures subject to comprehensive risk and Risk Not In the Model. Risk levels increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk, as well as an increase in positions subject to securitization charges.

(10)Risk-weighted assets declined during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as Citi received supervisory approval to remove the Comprehensive Risk Measure model surcharge for correlation trading portfolios, commencing with the third quarter of 2017. Further contributing to the decline in risk-weighted assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors.

(11)Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to changes in operational loss severity and frequency. Operational risk-weighted assets decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to assessed improvements in the business environment and risk controls and changes in operational loss severity and frequency.

Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S. 

Depository Institutions Under Current Regulatory Standards 

Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board. 

During 2017, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), is subject to effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, of 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively. Citibank’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital 

Conservation Buffer, were 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, respectively. Citibank is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

(1)Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets. 

(2)As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(3)Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. 

(4)Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. 

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2017 were in excess of the stated and effective minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2017 under the revised PCA regulations. 

Further, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under 

several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of 

the Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic 

conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios Under Current Regulatory Capital Standards 

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), under current regulatory capital standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements), as of December 31, 2017. This information is 

provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2017, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $11.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $9.0 billion. 

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $18.1 billion at December 31, 2017, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer 

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2017.

Basel III (Full Implementation)

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Basel III 

(Full Implementation)

Citi currently estimates that its effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules, on a fully implemented basis, inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as an expected 3.0% GSIB surcharge, may be 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively. 

Further, under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must also comply with a 4.0% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement and an effective 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for Citi as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

At December 31, 2017, Citi’s constraining Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were those derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was that resulting from application of the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. Further, each of Citi’s risk-based capital ratios was constrained by the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods prior to June 30, 2017.

(5)Of Citi’s $22.5 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2017, $10.2 billion were includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $12.3 billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2017 was $13.1 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $0.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if in excess of 10%/15% limitations. 

(6)Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, none of these assets were in excess of the 10%/15% limitations. At December 31, 2016, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased from year-end 2016 substantially due to higher credit risk-weighted assets, primarily resulting from corporate loan growth and increased repo-style transaction activity, partially offset by a decrease in OTC derivative trade activity and a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced Approaches decreased from year-end 2016, driven by substantially lower credit and operational risk-weighted assets. The decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform, changes in fair value and improved portfolio credit quality of OTC derivatives, residential mortgage loan sales and repayments, and divestitures of certain legacy assets. Operational risk-weighted assets decreased from year-end 2016 primarily due to assessed improvements in the business environment and risk controls, as well as changes in operational loss severity and frequency.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 7.1% for the third quarter of 2017 and 7.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was principally driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $6.3 billion of capital to common shareholders as well as the impact of Tax Reform. The decline in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2016 was largely attributable to a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $17.1 billion of capital to 

common shareholders as well as the impact of Tax Reform, in conjunction with an increase in Total Leverage Exposure primarily due to growth in average on-balance sheet assets.

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

(4)Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, was 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 6.7% for the third quarter of 2017 and 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the impact of Tax Reform, partially offset by capital contributions from Citibank’s parent, Citicorp, as well as a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure primarily due to a decline in potential future exposure on derivative contracts. The ratio remained unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016, as an increase in Tier 1 Capital was offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued several proposed and final rules during 2017, the most significant of which was designed to address final revisions or enhancements to the Basel III capital framework. 

Basel III: Finalizing Post-Crisis Regulatory Capital Reforms

In December 2017, the Basel Committee issued a rule that finalizes several outstanding Basel III post-crisis regulatory capital reforms. The reforms, which generally become effective in 2022, relate to the methodologies in deriving credit and operational risk-weighted assets, the imposition of a new aggregate output floor for risk-weighted assets, and revisions to the leverage ratio framework. 

The final rule, in part, revises the Standardized Approach in measuring credit risk-weighted assets with respect to certain on-balance sheet assets, such as in relation to the risk-weighting methodologies employed with respect to bank, corporate, and real estate (both residential and commercial) exposures; the treatment of off-balance sheet commitments; and aspects of the credit risk mitigation framework. Moreover, the final rule permits the use of external credit ratings combined with due diligence requirements in the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks and corporates, while also providing alternative approaches for jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external credit ratings for risk-based capital purposes, such as the U.S.

The final rule also revises the internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches, in part, by prohibiting the use of such approaches for so-called “low default” exposures, including those to banks and other financial institutions, as well as large corporations. Further, the final rule also prohibits the use of the IRB approaches for equity exposures in the banking book. Additionally, for other exposures where the IRB approaches are still permissible, the final rule establishes floors by exposure type regarding the estimation of certain model parameters used in the derivation of credit risk-weighted assets, and also provides greater specification as to permissible parameter estimation practices under the IRB approaches.

Apart from credit risk, the final rule substantially revises the operational risk capital framework applicable to the Advanced Approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets by introducing the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA). Operational risk capital is derived under the SMA through the combination of two components: a so-called “Business Indicator Component” and a “Loss Component.” The Business Indicator Component, primarily reflective of various income statement elements (i.e., a modified gross income indicator), is calculated as the sum of the three-year average of its components. The Loss Component reflects the operational loss exposure of a banking organization that can be inferred from internal loss experience, and is based on a 10-year average.

To reduce excessive variability with respect to risk-weighted assets, and to therefore enhance the comparability of risk-based capital ratios, the final rule establishes a floor requirement that is to be applied to total risk-weighted assets. More specifically, the risk-weighted assets that banks must use to determine compliance with risk-based capital requirements 

must be calculated as the maximum of (i) total risk-weighted assets calculated using the approaches that the bank has supervisory approval to use in accordance with the Basel III capital framework (including both standardized and internally-modeled based approaches), and (ii) 72.5% of the total risk-weighted assets, calculated using only standardized approaches.

Lastly, the final rule revises the design and calibration of the Basel III leverage ratio (similar to the U.S. Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio). Among the revisions are those with respect to the exposure measure (i.e., the denominator of the ratio) in relation to the treatment of derivative exposures, provisions, and off-balance sheet exposures. 

Although the U.S. banking agencies subsequently issued a statement announcing support for these finalized Basel III reforms, further indicating that they will “consider how to appropriately apply these revisions,” significant uncertainty nonetheless currently exists with regard to the manner and timeframe in which these Basel III capital reforms will be implemented in the U.S. 

Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements—Consolidated and 

Enhanced Framework

In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a final rule

that adopts further revisions arising from the second phase of its review of the “Pillar 3” disclosure requirements, and which builds on the initial revisions from phase one of the review, which were finalized in January 2015. 

The final rule consolidates all existing Basel Committee disclosure requirements into the Pillar 3 framework, with these constituting the disclosure requirements regarding the composition of capital, leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio, indicators for measuring the global systemic importance of banks, Countercyclical Capital Buffer, interest rate risk in the banking book, and remuneration. Moreover, the final rule introduces enhancements to the Pillar 3 framework, in part, by incorporating a “dashboard” of a banking organization’s key regulatory capital and liquidity metrics. The final rule also sets forth revisions and additions to the Pillar 3 framework resulting from ongoing reforms to the regulatory capital framework, including incorporating disclosure requirements arising from the Financial Stability Board’s total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) regime applicable to global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and revised disclosure requirements for market risk attributable to the revised market risk framework.

The Basel Committee announced in the final rule that it had commenced the third phase of its review of “Pillar 3” disclosure requirements, which will build further upon the revisions arising from the second phase of its review. Among other requirements, the third phase will include development of any disclosure requirements arising from the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms.

Citi is currently subject to the Advanced Approaches disclosure requirements, as well as those with respect to market risk, under the U.S. Basel III rules. The U.S. banking agencies may revise the nature and extent of these disclosure 

52

requirements in the future, as a result of the Basel Committee’s revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.

Regulatory Treatment of Accounting Provisions for Expected Credit Losses—Interim Approach and Transitional Arrangements

In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a final rule that retains, for an interim period, the current Basel III treatment, under both the Standardized Approach and Internal Ratings-Based Approaches, applicable to accounting provisions for credit losses. Such measure is in recognition of the promulgation by both the International Accounting Standards Board and more recently the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board of new accounting pronouncements (IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments,” and ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,” respectively) regarding the impairment of financial assets and adoption of provisioning standards which incorporate forward-looking assessments in the estimation of expected credit losses, which represents a substantial departure from the recognition of credit losses under the current incurred loss model. Measuring the impairment of loans and other financial assets under expected credit loss models may result in earlier recognition of, and higher accounting provisions for, credit losses, and consequently may increase volatility in regulatory capital. The current Basel III treatment is being retained so as to afford the Basel Committee additional time in which to thoroughly consider and develop a permanent regulatory capital treatment with respect to accounting provisions for expected credit losses. 

Moreover, the final rule provides for optional transitional arrangements, which may be availed by jurisdictions, that would permit banking organizations to more evenly absorb the potentially significant adverse impact on regulatory capital arising from the recognition of higher expected credit loss provisions. The final rule also establishes standards with which these transitional arrangements must comply. 

The U.S. banking agencies may revise the Basel III rules in the future in conjunction with the adoption by U.S. banking organizations of the current expected credit loss model as set forth under ASU 2016-13. 

Revised Assessment Framework for Global Systemically Important Banks

In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document which proposes revisions to the framework for assessing the global systemic importance of banks. The current framework employed by the Basel Committee as to the identification of GSIBs and the assessment of a surcharge is based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability/financial institution infrastructure, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories is composed of multiple indicators, amounting to 12 indicators in total. 

The proposal, which reflects the results of the Basel Committee’s planned initial review, sets forth several modifications to its GSIB framework, the most significant of 

which for Citi would be the removal of the existing cap on the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category. Among the other changes proposed by the Basel Committee and estimated to be of lesser impact to Citi, would be the introduction within the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category of a trading volume indicator, accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the current weighting of the existing underwriting indicator. Moreover, the Basel Committee’s proposed requirement to expand the scope of consolidation to include exposures of insurance subsidiaries within the size, interconnectedness, and complexity categories would raise the global aggregate of these respective measures of systemic importance to which all GSIBs are subject, and as a result it is estimated that Citi would benefit on a relative basis vis-a-vis certain other GSIBs, given that its insurance subsidiaries are presently consolidated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and for regulatory purposes. Aside from these proposed modifications, the Basel Committee is also separately seeking feedback on the potential for a new indicator regarding short-term wholesale funding. 

In contrast, a U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule is required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods, and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance resident under the Basel Committee’s framework to identify a GSIB and derive a surcharge. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. 

Accordingly, if the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt the Basel Committee’s proposed revisions with respect to the U.S. GSIB framework, Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge could potentially increase, while its method 2 GSIB surcharge would remain unchanged. Further, while it is currently estimated that under these circumstances method 2 would remain Citi’s binding constraint for GSIB surcharge purposes, nonetheless an increase in Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge could impact the extent to which Citi satisfies certain TLAC minimum requirements in the future. 

Revisions to the Securitization Framework

In July 2017, the Basel Committee issued two consultative documents: one which establishes criteria for identifying “simple, transparent, and comparable” (STC) short-term securitizations, and another which provides for an alternative, and potentially preferential, regulatory capital treatment for short-term securitizations identified as STC. The Basel Committee had previously issued criteria solely for identifying STC securitizations in July 2015, and also previously issued an alternative regulatory capital treatment for STC securitizations in July 2016. The July 2017 consultative documents, however, introduce identification criteria and regulatory capital treatments that are uniquely tailored to short-term securitizations, with a focus on exposures related to asset-backed commercial paper conduits. 

53

The U.S. banking agencies may revise the regulatory capital treatment of STC short-term securitizations in the future, based upon any revisions adopted by the Basel Committee.

Identification and Management of Step-in Risk

In October 2017, the Basel Committee issued final guidelines regarding the identification and management of so-called “step-in risk,” which is defined as “the risk that a bank decides to provide financial support to an unconsolidated entity that is facing stress, in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual obligations to provide such support.” The guidelines establish a framework to be used by banks for conducting a self-assessment of step-in risk, which would also be reported to each bank’s respective national supervisors. The self-assessment of step-in risk should consider the risk characteristics of certain unconsolidated entities, as well as the bank’s relationship to such entities. The framework, however, does not require any additional regulatory capital or liquidity charges beyond the current Basel III rules. 

The Basel Committee expects the guidelines to be enacted by member jurisdictions no later than 2020. The U.S. banking agencies may issue guidelines regarding the identification and measurement of step-in risk in the future, as a result of the Basel Committee’s guidelines.

54

Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share, Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE, tangible book value per share and returns on average TCE are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these capital metrics provide alternative measures of capital strength and performance and are commonly used by investors and industry analysts.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion sets forth what management currently believes could be the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to Citi or its management, could also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties Citi may face.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders Consistent with Its Capital Optimization Efforts Substantially Depends on the CCAR Process and the Results of Regulatory Stress Tests.

In addition to Board of Director approval, Citi’s ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its capital optimization efforts, whether through its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program, substantially depends on regulatory approval, including through the CCAR process required by the Federal Reserve Board and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information on Citi’s return of capital to common shareholders in 2017 as well as the CCAR process and supervisory stress test requirements, see “Capital Resources—Overview” and “Capital Resources—Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning” above.

Citi’s ability to accurately predict, interpret or explain to stakeholders the outcome of the CCAR process, and thus address any such market or investor perceptions, is difficult as the Federal Reserve Board’s assessment of Citi’s capital adequacy is conducted using the Board’s proprietary stress test models, as well as a number of qualitative factors, including a detailed assessment of Citi’s “capital adequacy process,” as defined by the Board. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that it expects leading capital adequacy practices will continue to evolve and will likely be determined by the Board each year as a result of its cross-firm review of capital plan submissions. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing requirements, several parameters of the annual stress testing process may be altered from time to time, including the severity of the stress test scenario, the Federal Reserve Board modeling of Citi’s balance sheet and the addition of components deemed important by the Federal Reserve Board (e.g., additional macroprudential considerations such as funding and liquidity shocks). 

Moreover, in 2016, senior officials at the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the Board was considering integration of the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. While there has been no formal proposal from the Federal Reserve Board to date, changes to the stress testing regime being discussed, among others, include introduction of a firm-specific “stress capital buffer” (SCB), which would be equal to the maximum decline in a firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under a severely adverse 

scenario over a nine-quarter CCAR measurement period, subject to a minimum requirement of 2.5%. Accordingly, a firm’s SCB would change annually based on its stress test results in the prior year. Officials discussed the idea that the SCB would replace the capital conservation buffer in both the firm’s ongoing regulatory capital requirements and as part of the floor for capital distributions in the CCAR process. Federal Reserve Board senior officials also noted that introduction of the SCB would have the effect of incorporating a firm’s then-effective GSIB surcharge into its post-stress test minimum capital requirements, which the Board has previously indicated it is considering.

Although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of, and the ultimate impact to Citi from, these changes to the Federal Reserve Board’s stress testing and CCAR regimes, these changes would likely increase the level of capital Citi is required to hold, thus potentially impacting the extent to which Citi is able to return capital to shareholders.

Citi, Its Management and Businesses Must Continually Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing Regulatory and Other Uncertainties and Changes in the U.S. and Globally.

Despite the adoption of final regulations in numerous areas impacting Citi and its businesses over the past several years, Citi, its management and businesses continually face ongoing regulatory uncertainties and changes, both in the U.S. and globally. While the areas of ongoing regulatory uncertainties and changes facing Citi are too numerous to list completely, various examples include, but are not limited to (i) uncertainties and potential fiscal, monetary and regulatory changes arising from the U.S. Presidential administration and Congress; (ii) potential changes to various aspects of the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi (see the CCAR risk factor and “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” above); and (iii) the terms of and other uncertainties resulting from the U.K.’s potential exit from the European Union (EU) (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor below).

Ongoing regulatory uncertainties and changes make Citi’s and its management’s long-term business, balance sheet and budget planning difficult or subject to change. For example, the U.S. Presidential administration has discussed various changes to certain regulatory requirements, which would require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact to Citi, its businesses and business planning. Business planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules or outcomes, which can change dramatically upon finalization, or upon implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies worldwide, and such guidance can change.

Moreover, U.S. and international regulatory initiatives have not always been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis, and areas of divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to the scope, interpretation, timing, structure or approach, leading to inconsistent or even conflicting regulations, including within a single jurisdiction. For example, in 2016, the European Commission proposed to introduce a new requirement for major banking groups 

56

headquartered outside the EU (which would include Citi) to establish an intermediate EU holding company where the foreign bank has two or more institutions (broadly meaning banks, broker-dealers and similar financial firms) established in the EU. While the proposal mirrors an existing U.S. requirement for non-U.S. banking organizations to form U.S. intermediate holding companies, if adopted, it could lead to additional complexity with respect to Citi’s resolution planning, capital and liquidity allocation and efficiency in various jurisdictions. Regulatory changes have also significantly increased Citi’s compliance risks and costs (see the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below).

Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the Negative Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital, Will Be Driven by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable Income and by the Provisions of and Guidance Issued in Connection with Tax Reform.

At December 31, 2017, after the $22.6 billion remeasurement of DTAs due to the impact of Tax Reform, Citi’s net DTAs were $22.5 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $9.4 billion, of which $12.3 billion was excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, on a fully implemented basis, under the U.S. Basel III rules (for additional information, see “Capital Resources—Components of Citigroup Capital Under Basel III (Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)” above). Of the net DTAs at December 31, 2017, $7.6 billion related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards (FTCs), net of a valuation allowance. The carry-forward utilization period for FTCs is 10 years and represents the most time-sensitive component of Citi’s DTAs. The FTC carry-forwards at December 31, 2017 expire over the period of 2018–2027. Citi must utilize any FTCs generated in the then-current year tax return prior to utilizing any carry-forward FTCs.

The accounting treatment for realization of DTAs, including FTCs, is complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax planning strategies. Citi’s ability to utilize its DTAs, including the FTC components, will be dependent upon Citi’s ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant tax carry-forward periods. Failure to realize any portion of the DTAs would also have a corresponding negative impact on Citi’s net income.

Citi expects transitional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) in 2018 regarding the required allocation of existing FTC carry-forwards to the appropriate FTC baskets as redefined by Tax Reform. The U.S. Treasury is also expected to provide transitional guidance that addresses the allocation of the overall domestic loss (ODL) to these FTC baskets. An ODL allows a company to recharacterize domestic income as income from sources outside the U.S., which enables a taxpayer to use FTC carry-forwards and FTCs generated in future years, assuming the generation of sufficient U.S. taxed income. If the guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury differs from Citi’s assumptions, the valuation allowance against Citi’s FTC carry-forwards would increase or decrease, depending upon the guidance received. Citi’s net income would change by a corresponding 

amount. However, a change in recognized FTC carry-forwards would not impact Citi’s regulatory capital, given that such amounts are already fully disallowed. 

Citi does not expect to be subject to the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) added by Tax Reform. However, U.S. Treasury guidance regarding BEAT could affect Citi’s decisions as to how to structure its non-U.S. operations, possibly in a less cost efficient manner. In addition, if BEAT were to be applicable to Citi in any given year, it could have a significantly adverse effect on both Citi’s net income and regulatory capital.

For additional information on the impact of Tax Reform and on Citi’s DTAs, including the FTCs, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Complex Tax Laws to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of the Relevant Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in the Payment of Additional Taxes, Penalties or Interest.

Citi is subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as the numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are inherently complex and Citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws, including Tax Reform as mentioned above, to its entities, operations and businesses. Citi’s interpretations and application of the tax laws, including with respect to Tax Reform, withholding tax obligations and stamp and other transactional taxes, could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which could result in the payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, which could be material. 

Citi’s Ongoing Investments and Efficiency Initiatives May Not Be as Successful as It Projects or Expects.

Citi continues to make important investments to streamline its infrastructure and improve its client experience. For example, Citi has been investing in higher return businesses, including the U.S. cards and wealth management businesses in Global Consumer Banking as well as certain businesses in Institutional Clients Group, such as equities. Citi continues to invest in its technology systems to enhance its digital capabilities across the franchise. In addition, in 2016, Citi announced a more than $1 billion investment in Citibanamex that is expected to be completed by 2020. Citi’s investment strategy will likely continue to evolve and change as its business strategy and priorities change. Citi also has been pursuing efficiency savings through its technology and digital initiatives, location strategy and organizational simplification. 

These investments and efficiency initiatives are being undertaken as part of Citi’s overall strategy to meet operational and financial objectives and targets, including earnings growth expectations. There is no guarantee that these or other initiatives Citi may pursue in its businesses or operations will be as productive or effective as Citi expects, or at all. Further, Citi’s ability to achieve expected returns on its investments and costs savings depends, in part, on factors that it cannot control, such as macroeconomic conditions, customer 

57

and client reactions and ongoing regulatory changes, among others.

Citi Has Co-Branding and Private Label Credit Card Relationships with Various Retailers and Merchants and the Failure to Maintain These Relationships Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Results of Operations or Financial Condition.

Citi has co-branding and private label relationships through its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services credit card businesses with various retailers and merchants globally in the ordinary course of business whereby Citi issues credit cards to customers of the retailers or merchants. Citi’s co-branding and private label agreements provide for shared economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term. The five largest relationships constituted an aggregate of approximately 11% of Citi’s revenues for 2017.

These relationships could be negatively impacted due to, among other things, declining sales and revenues or other difficulties of the retailer or merchant, termination due to a breach by Citi, the retailer or merchant of its responsibilities, or external factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. Over the last several years, a number of retailers in the U.S. have continued to experience declining sales, which has resulted in significant numbers of store closures and, in a number of cases, bankruptcies, as retailers attempt to cut costs and compete with online retailers. In addition, as has been widely reported, competition among card issuers, including Citi, for these relationships is significant, and it has become increasingly difficult in recent years to maintain such relationships on the same terms or at all. While various mitigating factors could be available to Citi if any of these events were to occur—such as by replacing the retailer or merchant or offering other card products—such events could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations or financial condition, including as a result of loss of revenues, higher cost of credit, impairment of purchased credit card relationships and contract-related intangibles or other losses (for information on Citi’s credit card related intangibles generally, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Challenges and Uncertainties Globally Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Businesses and Results of Operations.

Citi has experienced, and could experience in the future, negative impacts to its businesses and results of operations as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, uncertainties and volatility. As a result of a 2016 U.K. referendum, the U.K. triggered Article 50 in March 2017, beginning the two-year period in which the U.K. will negotiate its exit from the EU. Since then, numerous uncertainties have arisen, including, among others, (i) potential changes to Citi’s legal entity and booking model strategy and/or structure in both the U.K. and the EU based on the outcome of negotiations relating to the regulation of financial services; (ii) the potential impact of the exit to the U.K. and European economies and other financial markets; and (iii) the potential 

impact to Citi’s exposures to counterparties as a result of any economic slowdown in the U.K. or Europe. 

In addition, governmental fiscal and monetary actions, or expected actions, such as changes in the federal funds rate and any balance sheet normalization program implemented by the Federal Reserve Board or other central banks, could impact interest rates, economic growth rates, the volatilities of global financial markets, foreign exchange rates and capital flows among countries. Although Citi estimates its overall net interest revenue would generally increase due to higher interest rates, higher rates could adversely affect Citi’s funding costs, levels of deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or product revenues. Also, the U.S. Presidential administration has indicated it may pursue protectionist trade and other policies, which could result in additional macroeconomic and/or geopolitical challenges, uncertainties and volatilities. Further, the economic and fiscal situations of certain European countries have remained fragile, and concerns and uncertainties remain in Europe over the potential exit of additional countries from the EU. 

These and other global macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, uncertainties and volatilities have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including its credit costs, revenues in its Markets and securities services and other businesses, and AOCI (which would in turn negatively impact Citi’s book and tangible book value).

Citi’s Presence in the Emerging Markets Subjects It to Various Risks as well as Increased Compliance and Regulatory Risks and Costs.

During 2017, emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately 36% of Citi’s total revenues (Citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in Latin America, Asia (other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand), Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa).

Citi’s presence in the emerging markets subjects it to a number of risks, including sovereign volatility, political events, foreign exchange controls, limitations on foreign investment, sociopolitical instability (including from hyper-inflation), fraud, nationalization or loss of licenses, business restrictions, sanctions or asset freezes, potential criminal charges, closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation of assets. For example, Citi operates in several countries that have, or have had in the past, strict foreign exchange controls, such as Argentina, that limit its ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and/or transfer funds outside the country. In prior years, Citi has also discovered fraud in certain emerging markets in which it operates. Political turmoil and other instability have occurred in certain regions and countries, including Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, which have required management time and attention in prior years (e.g., monitoring the impact of sanctions on the Venezuelan and other countries’ economies as well as Citi’s businesses and results of operations).

Citi’s emerging markets presence also increases its compliance and regulatory risks and costs. For example, Citi’s operations in emerging markets, including facilitating cross-

58

border transactions on behalf of its clients, subject it to higher compliance risks under U.S. regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, such as anti-money laundering regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These risks can be more acute in less-developed markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of Citi’s business activities. Any failure by Citi to comply with applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which it operates as a result of its global footprint, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations and reputation.

Citi’s Inability in Its Resolution Plan Submissions to Address Any Deficiencies Identified or Future Guidance Provided by the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC Could Subject Citi to More Stringent Capital, Leverage or Liquidity Requirements, or Restrictions on Its Growth, Activities or Operations, and Could Eventually Require Citi to Divest Assets or Operations.

Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to prepare and submit a plan to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC for the orderly resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding company) and its significant legal entities, under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of future material financial distress or failure. Citi submitted its most recent resolution plan in July 2017. On December 19, 2017, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC informed Citi that (i) the agencies jointly decided that Citi’s 2017 resolution plan submission satisfactorily addressed the shortcomings identified in the 2015 resolution plan submission, and (ii) the agencies did not identify any deficiencies in the 2017 resolution plan submission. Citi’s next resolution plan submission is due July 1, 2019. For additional information on Citi’s 2017 resolution plan submission, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

Under Title I, if the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly determine that Citi’s resolution plan is not “credible” (which, although not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow the regulators to resolve Citi in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption), or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of Citi under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and Citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified deficiencies, Citi could be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on its growth, activities or operations. If within two years from the imposition of any requirements or restrictions Citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies, then Citi could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. Any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact Citi’s reputation, market and investor perception, operations and strategy.

Citi’s Performance and the Performance of Its Individual Businesses Could Be Negatively Impacted if Citi Is Not Able to Hire and Retain Highly Qualified Employees for Any Reason.

Citi’s performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely depends on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled employees. Specifically, Citi’s continued ability to compete in its businesses, to manage its businesses effectively and to continue to execute its overall global strategy depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. If Citi is unable to continue to attract and retain the most highly qualified employees for any reason, Citi’s performance, including its competitive position, the successful execution of its overall strategy and its results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees depends on numerous factors, some of which are outside of its control. For example, the banking industry generally is subject to more stringent regulation of executive and employee compensation than other industries, including deferral and clawback requirements for incentive compensation. Citi often competes in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to such significant regulatory restrictions on the structure of incentive compensation. Other factors that could impact Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees include its culture, compensation, and the management and leadership of the company as well as its individual businesses, presence in the particular market or region at issue and the professional opportunities it offers. 

U.S. and Non-U.S. Financial Services Companies and Others Pose Increasingly Competitive Challenges to Citi.

Citi operates in an increasingly competitive environment, which includes both financial and non-financial services firms. These companies compete on the basis of, among other factors, quality and type of products and services offered, price, technology and reputation. Citi competes with financial services companies in the U.S. and globally, which continually develop and introduce new products and services. In addition, in recent years, non-financial services firms, such as financial technology firms, have begun to offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions, such as Citi. These firms attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of companies and individuals to borrow money, save and invest. To the extent it is not able to effectively compete with these and other firms, Citi could be placed at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in loss of customers and market share, and its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. For additional information on Citi’s competitors, see the co-brand and private label cards risk factor above and “Supervision, Regulation and Other—Competition” below.

CREDIT RISKS

Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.

Concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market risk, can increase Citi’s risk of significant losses. As of year-end 2017, Citi’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies (for additional information, including concentrations of credit risk to other public sector entities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Citi also routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign exchange transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment banks, governments, central banks and other financial institutions.

As regulatory or market developments continue to lead to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses, central agents, exchanges or other financial market utilities, Citi could also experience an increase in concentration of risk to these industries. These concentrations of risk as well as the risk of failure of a large counterparty, central counterparty clearing house or financial market utility could limit the effectiveness of Citi’s hedging strategies and cause Citi to incur significant losses.

LIQUIDITY RISKS

The Maintenance of Adequate Liquidity and Funding Depends on Numerous Factors, Including Those Outside of Citi’s Control, Such as Market Disruptions and Increases in Citi’s Credit Spreads.

As a global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s liquidity and sources of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets, governmental fiscal and monetary policies, regulatory changes or negative investor perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness.

In addition, Citi’s costs to obtain and access secured funding and long-term unsecured funding are directly related to its credit spreads. Changes in credit spreads constantly occur and are market driven, including both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, and can be highly volatile. 

Moreover, Citi’s ability to obtain funding may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time, or if market appetite is reduced, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis. A sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or lengthier dislocation of underwriting and capital markets activity. In addition, clearing organizations, regulators, clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may exercise the right to require additional collateral based on these market perceptions or market conditions, which could further impair Citi’s access to and cost of funding.

As a holding company, Citi relies on interest, dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund 

dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements. Limitations on the payments that Citi receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity.

The Credit Rating Agencies Continuously Review the Credit Ratings of Citi and Certain of Its Subsidiaries, and Ratings Downgrades Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Funding and Liquidity Due to Reduced Funding Capacity and Increased Funding Costs, Including Derivatives Triggers That Could Require Cash Obligations or Collateral Requirements.

The credit rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citi and its more significant subsidiaries’ long-term/senior debt and short-term/commercial paper, as applicable, are based on a number of factors, including standalone financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies’ proprietary rating agency methodologies and assumptions and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally.

Citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades could negatively impact Citi’s ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as the costs of those funds, and its ability to maintain certain deposits. A ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, as well as the impact of derivative triggers, which could require Citi to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on other funding sources, such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers, as well as on contractual provisions and other credit requirements of Citi’s counterparties and clients, which may contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for Citi to hold third-party funds.

Moreover, credit ratings downgrades can have impacts that may not be currently known to Citi or are not possible to quantify. For example, some entities may have ratings limitations as to their permissible counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be aware. In addition, certain of Citi’s corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of certain contracts or market instruments with Citi in response to ratings downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only Citi’s funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citi’s or Citibank’s credit ratings, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

60

OPERATIONAL RISKS

A Disruption of Citi’s Operational Systems Could Negatively Impact Citi’s Reputation, Customers, Clients, Businesses or Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

A significant portion of Citi’s operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information as well as the monitoring of a large number of complex transactions on a minute-by-minute basis. For example, through its Global Consumer Banking and credit card and securities services businesses in Institutional Clients Group, Citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and client-specific information for its retail, corporate and governmental customers and clients and must accurately record and reflect their extensive account transactions.

With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet, mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, large global financial institutions such as Citi have been, and will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of operational disruption or cyber or information security incidents from these activities (for additional information on cybersecurity risk, see the discussion below). These incidents are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources, not all of which are in Citi’s control, including among others human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other similar damage to Citi’s property or assets. These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with which Citi does business, such as failures by Internet, mobile technology and cloud service providers or other vendors to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent system disruptions or cyber attacks.

Such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of Citi (such as the temporary loss of availability of Citi’s online banking system or mobile banking platform), as well as the operations of its clients, customers or other third parties. Given Citi’s global footprint and the high volume of transactions processed by Citi, certain errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified, which would further increase these costs and consequences. Any such events could also result in financial losses as well as misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information or assets, which could negatively impact Citi’s reputation, customers, clients, businesses or results of operations and financial condition, perhaps significantly.

Citi’s and Third Parties’ Computer Systems and Networks Have Been, and Will Continue to Be, Subject to an Increasing Risk of Continually Evolving, Sophisticated Cybersecurity Risks That Could Result in the Theft, Loss, Misuse or Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer Information, Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs to Citi, Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.

Citi’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to ongoing cyber incidents such as unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), 

account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other similar events. These threats can arise from external parties, including criminal organizations, extremist parties and certain foreign state actors that engage in cyber activities. 

Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which Citi’s customers do business, may also be sources of cybersecurity risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources certain functions, such as processing customer credit card transactions, uploading content on customer-facing websites, and developing software for new products and services. These relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by third-party hosting of or access to Citi websites, which could result in compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious code, resulting in security breaches impacting Citi customers. Furthermore, because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, including as a result of the derivatives reforms over the last few years, Citi has increased exposure to cyber attacks through third parties.

As further evidence of the increasing and potentially significant impact of cyber incidents, in 2017, a credit bureau reported a cyber incident that impacted sensitive information of an estimated 143 million consumers. In addition, in recent years, several U.S. retailers and financial institutions and other multinational companies reported cyber incidents that compromised customer data or resulted in theft of funds or theft or destruction of corporate information or other assets. Moreover, the U.S. government as well as several multinational companies reported cyber incidents in prior years that affected their computer systems resulting in the data of millions of customers and employees being compromised. These incidents have resulted in increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of firms’ cybersecurity protection services and calls for additional laws and regulations to further enhance protection of consumers’ personal data.

While Citi has not been materially impacted by these reported or other cyber incidents, Citi has been subject to other intentional cyber incidents from external sources over the last several years, including (i) denial of service attacks, which attempted to interrupt service to clients and customers, (ii) data breaches, which obtained unauthorized access to customer account data and (iii) malicious software attacks on client systems, which attempted to allow unauthorized entrance to Citi’s systems under the guise of a client and the extraction of client data. While Citi’s monitoring and protection services were able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its systems before they became significant, they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale.

Further, although Citi devotes significant resources to implement, maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with measures such as intrusion 

61

detection and prevention and firewalls to safeguard critical business applications, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. Because the methods used to cause cyber attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched, Citi may be unable to implement effective preventive measures or proactively address these methods until they are discovered. In addition, while Citi engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing, such as performing onsite security control assessments and limiting third-party access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job functions, these actions cannot prevent all external cyber attacks, information breaches or similar losses.

Cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary customer or client information, damage to Citi’s reputation with its clients and the market, customer dissatisfaction, additional costs (including credit costs) to Citi (such as repairing systems, replacing customer payment cards or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, exposure to litigation and other financial losses, including loss of funds, to both Citi and its clients and customers (for additional information on the potential impact from cyber incidents, see the operational systems risk factor above).

While Citi maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.

Incorrect Assumptions or Estimates in Citi’s Financial Statements Could Cause Significant Unexpected Losses in the Future, and Changes to Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact on How Citi Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

U.S. GAAP requires Citi to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including reserves related to litigation and regulatory exposures, valuation of DTAs, the estimate of the allowance for credit losses and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If Citi’s assumptions or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual future events, Citi could experience unexpected losses, some of which could be significant.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued several financial accounting and reporting standards that will govern key aspects of Citi’s financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, including those areas where Citi is required to make assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB’s new accounting standard on credit losses, which will become effective for Citi on January 1, 2020, will require earlier recognition of credit losses on financial assets. The new accounting model requires that lifetime “expected credit losses” on financial assets not recorded at fair value through net income, such as loans and held-to-maturity securities, be recorded at inception of the financial asset, replacing the 

multiple existing impairment models under U.S. GAAP that generally require that a loss be “incurred” before it is recognized (for additional information on this and other accounting standards, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below).

Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, could present operational challenges and could require Citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi May Incur Significant Losses and Its Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios Could be Negatively Impacted if Its Risk Management Process, Strategies or Models Are Deficient or Ineffective.

Citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and mitigation processes and strategies, including the use of various risk models in analyzing and monitoring the various risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For example, Citi uses models as part of its various stress testing initiatives across Citi. Citi also relies on data to aggregate, assess and manage various risk exposures. Management of these risks is made even more challenging within a global financial institution such as Citi, particularly given the complex, diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which Citi operates.

These processes, strategies and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in many circumstances, and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Citi could incur significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively impacted, if Citi’s risk management processes, including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or models are deficient or ineffective. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk reporting.

Moreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, including its credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking agencies regarding the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk-weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s 

62

capital ratios and its ability to achieve its regulatory capital requirements as it projects or as required.

COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT AND LEGAL RISKS

Ongoing Implementation and Interpretation of Regulatory Changes and Requirements in the U.S. and Globally Have Increased Citi’s Compliance Risks and Costs.

As referenced above, over the past several years, Citi has been required to implement a significant number of regulatory changes across all of its businesses and functions, and these changes continue. In some cases, Citi’s implementation of a regulatory requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance, legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules. Moreover, in many cases, these are entirely new regulatory requirements or regimes, resulting in much uncertainty regarding regulatory expectations as to what is definitely required in order to be in compliance. Accompanying this compliance uncertainty is heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the U.S. and globally for the financial services industry with respect to governance and risk management practices, including its compliance and regulatory risks (for a discussion of heightened regulatory expectations on “conduct risk” at, and the overall “culture” of, financial institutions such as Citi, see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below). All of these factors have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs for Citi.

Examples of regulatory changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include (i) the Federal Reserve Board’s “total loss absorbing capacity” (TLAC) requirements, including consequences of a breach of the external long-term debt (LTD) requirement and the clean holding company requirements, given there are no cure periods for the requirements, and the new “anti-evasion” provision that authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to exclude from a bank holding company’s outstanding external LTD any debt having certain features that would, in the Board’s view, “significantly impair” the debt’s ability to absorb losses; (ii) the Volcker Rule, which requires Citi to maintain an extensive global compliance regime, including significant documentation to support the prohibition against proprietary trading; and (iii) a proliferation of laws relating to the limitation of cross-border data movement, including data localization and protection and privacy laws, which can conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect to anti-money laundering laws.

Extensive compliance requirements can result in increased reputational and legal risks, as failure to comply with regulations and requirements, or failure to comply as expected, can result in enforcement and/or regulatory proceedings (for additional discussion, see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below). In addition, increased and ongoing compliance requirements and uncertainties have resulted in higher costs for Citi. For example, Citi employed roughly 30,000 risk, regulatory and compliance staff as of year-end 2017, out of a total employee population of 209,000, compared to approximately 14,000 as of year-end 2008 with a total employee population of 323,000. 

These higher regulatory and compliance costs can impede Citi’s ongoing, business-as-usual cost reduction efforts, and can also require management to reallocate resources, including potentially away from ongoing business investment initiatives, as discussed above.

Citi Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries That Could Result in Significant Penalties and Other Negative Impacts on Citi, Its Businesses and Results of Operations.

At any given time, Citi is defending a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations and other inquiries. Over the last several years, the frequency with which such proceedings, investigations and inquiries are initiated have increased substantially, and the global judicial, regulatory and political environment has generally been unfavorable for large financial institutions. The complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of Citi’s operations, also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions.

Moreover, U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused on “conduct risk,” a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third-party vendors utilized by Citi, that could harm clients, customers, investors or the markets, such as improperly creating, selling, marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive compensation programs with respect thereto, failures to safeguard a party’s personal information, or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest. In addition to increasing Citi’s compliance and reputational risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings and civil litigation, including for practices which historically were acceptable but are now receiving greater scrutiny. Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients, customers, investors or the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms, including Citi. In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in Citi’s culture, such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings.

Further, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which Citi is subject has increased substantially in recent years. U.S. and certain international governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions from, financial institutions, and criminal prosecutors in the U.S. have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements against corporate entities and other criminal sanctions from those institutions. For example, in 2015, an affiliate of Citi pleaded guilty to an antitrust violation and paid a substantial fine to resolve a U.S. 

63

Department of Justice investigation into Citi’s foreign exchange business practices. These types of actions by U.S. and international governmental entities may, in the future, have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers and business, and the inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies, consent orders, sanctions, substantial fines and penalties, remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future, including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of which could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, business practices, financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi’s operations or cause Citi reputational harm.

 Further, many large claims—both private civil and regulatory—asserted against Citi are highly complex, slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, these accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued. In addition, certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved.

For additional information relating to Citi’s legal and regulatory proceedings and matters, including Citi’s policies on establishing legal accruals, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

Overview

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition, the key principles that guide it, and Citi's risk appetite.

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical culture. Under Citi’s mission and value proposition, which was developed by Citi’s senior leadership and distributed throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all employees to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in our clients’ interests, create economic value and are always systemically responsible. Additionally, Citi evaluates employees’ performance against behavioral expectations set out in Citi’s leadership standards, which were designed in part to effectuate Citi’s mission and value proposition. Other culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics and leadership, escalation, and treating customers fairly help Citi to execute its mission and value proposition.

Citi’s Company-wide risk governance framework consists of the policies, procedures, and processes through which Citi identifies, measures, manages, monitors, reports and controls risks across the Company. It also emphasizes Citi’s risk culture and lays out standards, procedures and programs that are designed and undertaken to enhance the Company’s risk culture, embed this culture deeply within the organization, and give employees tools to make sound and ethical risk decisions and to escalate issues appropriately. The risk governance framework has been developed in alignment with the expectations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Heightened Standards. It is also aligned with the relevant components of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s corporate governance principles for banks and relevant components of the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and Foreign Banking Organizations.

Four key principles—common purpose, responsible finance, ingenuity and leadership—guide Citi as it performs its mission. Citi’s risk appetite, which is approved by the Citigroup Board of Directors, specifies the aggregate levels and types of risk the Board and management are willing to assume to achieve Citi’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with applicable capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.

Citi selectively takes risks in support of its underlying business strategy, while striving to ensure it operates within its mission and value proposition and risk appetite.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows:

•Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality or failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations.

•Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial condition of the Company. The risk may be exacerbated by the inability of the Company to access funding sources or monetize assets and the composition of liability funding and liquid assets.

•Market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables, such as interest rates, exchange rates or credit spreads. Losses can be exacerbated by the presence of basis or correlation risks.

•Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, human factors, or from external events. It includes risk of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations, but excludes strategic risk (see below). It also includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which Citi is involved as well as compliance, conduct and legal risks. Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well as related support, and can result in losses arising from events related to fraud, theft and unauthorized activity; employment practices and workplace environment; clients, products and business practices; physical assets and infrastructure; and execution, delivery and process management. 

•Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, local, national or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies or other relevant standards of conduct or risk of harming customers, clients or the integrity of the market.

•Conduct risk is the risk that Citi’s employees or agents may (intentionally or through negligence) harm customers, clients or the integrity of the markets, and thereby the integrity of Citi.

•Legal risk includes the risk from uncertainty due to legal or regulatory actions, proceedings or investigations, or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations.

•Reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion.

•Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from poor, but authorized business decisions, an inability to adapt to changes in the operating environment or other external factors that may impair the ability to carry out a business strategy. Strategic risk also includes:

•Country risk which is the risk that an event in a country (precipitated by developments within or external to a country) will impair the value of Citi’s franchise or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that country to honor their 

66

obligations. Country risk events may include sovereign defaults, banking crises, currency crises, currency convertibility and/or transferability restrictions, or political events.

Citi manages its risks through each of its three lines of defense: (i) business management, (ii) independent control functions and (iii) internal audit. The three lines of defense collaborate with each other in structured forums and processes to bring various perspectives together and to lead the organization toward outcomes that are in clients’ interests, create economic value and are systemically responsible.

First Line of Defense: Business Management

Each of Citi’s businesses owns its risks and is responsible for assessing and managing its risks. Each business is also responsible for establishing and operating controls to mitigate key risks, assessing internal controls and promoting a culture of compliance and control. In doing so, a business is required to maintain appropriate staffing and implement appropriate procedures to fulfill its risk governance responsibilities.

The CEOs of each region and business report to the Citigroup CEO. The Head of Operations and Technology and the Head of Productivity, who are considered part of the first line of defense, also report to the Citigroup CEO.

Businesses at Citi organize and chair committees and councils that cover risk considerations with participation from independent control functions, including committees or councils that are designed to consider matters related to capital, assets and liabilities, business practices, business risks and controls, mergers and acquisitions, the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending and incentives.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Control Functions

Citi’s independent control functions, including Risk, Independent Compliance Risk Management, Human Resources, Legal, Finance and Finance & Risk Infrastructure, set standards by which Citi and its businesses manage and oversee risks, including compliance with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, policies and other relevant standards of conduct. Additionally, among other responsibilities, the independent control functions provide advice and training to Citi’s businesses and establish tools, methodologies, processes and oversight for controls used by the businesses to foster a culture of compliance and control.

Risk

The Risk organization is designed to act as an independent partner of the business to manage market, credit and operational risk in a manner consistent with Citi’s risk appetite. Risk establishes policies and guidelines for risk assessments and risk management and contributes to controls and tools to manage, measure and mitigate risks taken by the Company.

The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and the Risk Management Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer has regular and unrestricted access to the Risk Management Committee of the Board and 

also to the Citigroup Board of Directors to address risks and issues identified through Risk’s activities.

Independent Compliance Risk Management

The Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) organization is designed to protect Citi by overseeing senior management, the businesses, and other control functions in managing compliance risk, as well as promoting business conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-wide compliance risk management framework and culture that identifies, measures, monitors, mitigates and controls compliance risk across the three lines of defense. For further information on Citi’s compliance risk framework, see “Compliance Risk” below.

The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and has regular and unrestricted access to the committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee and the Ethics and Culture Committee.

Human Resources

The Human Resources organization provides personnel support and governance in connection with, among other things: recognizing and rewarding employees who demonstrate Citi’s values and excel in their roles and responsibilities; setting ethical- and performance-related expectations and developing and promoting employees who meet those expectations; and searching for, assessing and hiring staff who exemplify Citi’s leadership standards, which outline Citi’s expectations of its employees’ behavior.

The Head of Human Resources reports to the Citigroup CEO and interacts regularly with the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Legal

The Legal organization is involved in a number of activities designed to promote the appropriate management of Citi’s exposure to legal risk, which includes the risk of loss, whether financial or reputational, due to legal or regulatory actions, proceedings or investigations, or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations. Activities designed to promote appropriate management of legal risk include, among others: promoting and supporting Citigroup’s governance processes; advising business management, other independent control functions, the Citigroup Board of Directors and committees of the Board regarding analysis of laws and regulations, regulatory matters, disclosure matters, and potential risks and exposures on key litigation and transactional matters, among other things; advising other independent control functions in their efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal standards of conduct; serving on key management committees; reporting and escalating key legal issues to senior management or other independent control functions; participating in internal investigations and overseeing regulatory investigations; and advising businesses on a day-to-day basis on legal, regulatory and contractual matters.

67

The General Counsel reports to the Citigroup CEO and is responsible to the full Citigroup Board. In addition to having regular and unrestricted access to the full Citigroup Board of Directors, the General Counsel or his/her delegates regularly attend meetings of the Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee, Operations and Technology Committee, and Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, as well as other ad hoc committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Finance

The Finance organization is primarily composed of the following disciplines: treasury, controllers, tax and financial planning and analysis. These disciplines partner with the businesses, providing key data and consultation to facilitate sound decisions in support of the businesses’ objectives. Through these activities, Finance serves as an independent control function advising business management, escalating identified risks and establishing policies or processes to manage risk.

Through the treasury discipline, Finance has overall responsibility for managing Citi’s balance sheet and accordingly partners with the businesses to manage Citi’s liquidity and interest rate risk (price risk for non-trading portfolios). Treasury works with the businesses to establish balance sheet targets and limits, as well as sets policies on funding costs charged for business assets based on their liquidity and duration.

Principally through the controllers discipline, Finance is responsible for establishing a strong control environment over Citi’s financial reporting processes consistent with the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Finance is led by Citi’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who reports directly to the Citigroup CEO. The CFO chairs or co-chairs several management committees that serve as key governance and oversight forums for business activities. In addition, the CFO has regular and unrestricted access to the full Citigroup Board of Directors as well as to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Finance & Risk Infrastructure

Finance & Risk Infrastructure (FRI) is a Citi global function that was formed in April 2016 from groups within the Finance and Risk global functions. FRI was established to globally implement common data and data standards, common processes and integrated technology platforms as well as integrate infrastructure activities across both Finance and Risk. FRI works to drive straight through data processing and produce more effective and efficient processes and governance aimed at supporting both the Finance and Risk organizations.

 The head of the FRI global function reports jointly to Citi’s CFO and Chief Risk Officer.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit

Citi’s Internal Audit function independently reviews activities of the first two lines of defense based on a risk-based audit plan and methodology approved by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Internal Audit also provides independent assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators regarding the effectiveness of Citi’s governance and controls designed to mitigate Citi’s exposure to risks and to enhance Citi’s culture of compliance and control.

The Chief Auditor reports functionally to the Chairman of the Citigroup Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO of Citigroup. Internal Audit’s responsibilities are carried out independently under the oversight of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit’s employees accordingly report to the Chief Auditor and do not have reporting lines to front-line units or senior management. Internal Audit’s staff members are not permitted to provide internal-audit services for a business line or function in which they had business line or function responsibilities within the previous 12 months.

Three Lines of Defense

Citigroup Board of Directors and Committees of the Board

Citigroup’s Board of Directors oversees Citi’s risk-taking activities and holds management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. To do so, directors review reports prepared by the businesses, Risk, Independent Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit and others, and exercise sound independent judgment to question, probe and challenge recommendations and decisions made by management.

The standing committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors are the Executive Committee, Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee, Operations and Technology Committee and Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee. In addition to the standing committees, the Board creates ad hoc committees from time to time in response to regulatory, legal or other requirements.

CREDIT RISK

Overview

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business activities, including:

•consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 

•capital markets derivative transactions; 

•structured finance; and 

•securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities loaned and borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as an institution. As a result, Citi has a well-established framework in place for managing credit risk across all businesses. This includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits and credit policies, both at the business level as well as at the company-wide level. Citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and policies with respect to problem recognition, including “watch lists,” portfolio reviews, stress tests, updated risk ratings and classification triggers. 

With respect to Citi’s settlement and clearing activities, intra-day client usage of lines is monitored against limits, as well as against usage patterns. To the extent a problem develops, Citi typically moves the client to a secured (collateralized) operating model. Generally, Citi’s intra-day settlement and clearing lines are uncommitted and cancelable at any time.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi has in place a correlation framework consisting of industry limits, an idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a specialized framework consisting of product limits.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as well as loan and other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its loan loss reserve process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as through regular stress testing at the company, business, geography and product levels. These stress-testing processes typically estimate 

potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties.

There is an independent Chief Risk Officer for each of Citi’s consumer, commercial and corporate lending businesses within ICG and GCB (Business CROs). Each of these Business CROs reports directly to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer. The Business CROs are the focal point for most day-to-day risk decisions, such as setting risk limits and approving transactions within the businesses. In addition there are Regional and Legal Entity Chief Risk Officers. There is an independent Chief Risk Officer for Asia, EMEA and Latin America, including Mexico (Regional CROs). Each of these Regional CROs reports directly to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer. The Regional CROs are accountable for overseeing the management of all risks in their geographic areas and across businesses, and are the primary risk contacts for the Regional Chief Executive Officers and local regulators. Legal Entity Chief Risk Officers are responsible for identifying and managing risks in Citibank as well as other specific legal entities, with Citibank’s Chief Risk Officer reporting directly to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer.

For additional information on Citi’s credit risk management, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumer Credit

Citi provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and credit card products in 19 countries and jurisdictions through North America GCB, Latin America GCB and Asia GCB. The retail banking products include consumer mortgages, home equity, personal and commercial loans and lines of credit and similar related products with a focus on lending to prime customers. Citi uses its risk appetite framework to define its lending parameters. In addition, Citi uses proprietary scoring models for new customer approvals. As stated in “Global Consumer Banking” above, GCB’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the affluent and emerging affluent consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies. GCB’s commercial banking business focuses on small to mid-sized businesses.

Consumer Credit Portfolio

The following table shows Citi’s quarterly end-of-period consumer loans:(1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Overall Consumer Credit Trends

The following charts show the quarterly trends in delinquencies and net credit losses across both retail banking, including commercial banking, and cards for total GCB and by region. 

Global Consumer Banking

North America

North America GCB provides mortgages, home equity loans, personal loans and commercial banking products through Citi’s retail banking network and card products through Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services businesses. The retail bank is concentrated in six major metropolitan cities in the United States (for additional information on the U.S. retail bank, see “North America GCB” above).

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 71% of North America GCB consumer loans consisted of Citi-branded and Citi retail services cards, which generally drives the overall credit performance of North America GCB, including the credit performance year-over-year as of the fourth quarter of 2017 (for additional information on North America GCB’s cards portfolios, including delinquency and net credit loss rates, see “Credit Card Trends” below). 

Quarter-over-quarter, 90+ days past due delinquency rates increased, primarily due to seasonality in the cards portfolios and the hurricane-related impact to the mortgage portfolio. The net credit loss rate decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting the absence of an episodic charge-off in the commercial portfolio that occurred in the third quarter of 2017. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year primarily due to seasoning in both cards portfolios. 

Latin America

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks, and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages, personal loans and commercial banking products. Latin America GCB serves a more mass market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multi-product relationships with customers.

As set forth in the chart above, 90+ days past due

delinquency rates improved year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by the commercial portfolio. The improvement year-over-year was partially offset by a higher delinquency rate in cards due to the seasoning of the portfolio. The net credit loss rate increased in Latin America GCB year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as of the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to an episodic charge-off in the commercial portfolio as well as seasoning in the cards portfolio.

Asia(1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Asia GCB operates in 17 countries in Asia and EMEA and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages, personal loans and commercial banking products. As shown in the chart above, 90+ days past due delinquency and net credit loss rates were largely stable in Asia GCB year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as of the fourth quarter of 2017. This stability reflects the strong credit profiles in Asia GCB’s target customer segments. In addition, regulatory changes in many markets in Asia over the past few years have resulted in stable or improved portfolio credit quality, despite weaker macroeconomic conditions in several countries.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations above and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Card Trends 

The following charts show the quarterly trends in delinquencies and net credit losses for total GCB cards, Citi’s North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios as well as for Citi’s Latin America and Asia Citi-branded cards portfolios.

Total Cards

North America Citi-Branded Cards

North America GCB’s Citi-branded cards portfolio issues proprietary and co-branded cards. As shown in the chart above, the 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Citi-branded cards was stable year-over-year and seasonally higher quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year primarily due to seasoning, and decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily due to seasonality as well as higher asset sales.

North America Citi Retail Services

Citi retail services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private-label and co-branded consumer and commercial cards. Citi retail services’ target market is focused on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Citi retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential. 

Citi retail services’ delinquency and net credit loss rates increased year-over-year, primarily due to seasoning as well as softness in the collections rates experienced once an account reaches mid-stage delinquency. The quarter-over-quarter increase in both loss and delinquency rates is also due to the seasonal movements observed in Citi retail services. 

Latin America Citi-Branded Cards

Latin America GCB issues proprietary and co-branded cards. As set forth in the chart above, the net credit loss and delinquency rates increased year-over-year due to seasoning. The decrease quarter-over-quarter of the net credit loss and delinquency rates was primarily driven by higher payment rates reflecting the payment of year-end bonuses.

73

Asia Citi-Branded Cards(1)

(1)Asia includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Asia GCB issues proprietary and co-branded cards. As set forth in the chart above, 90+ days past due delinquency and net credit loss rates have remained broadly stable, driven by the mature and well-diversified nature of the cards portfolio. 

For additional information on cost of credit, delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations above and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

North America Cards FICO Distribution

The following tables show the current FICO score distributions for Citi’s North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio and on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For additional information on delinquency and net credit loss trends in Citi’s consumer mortgage portfolio, see “Additional Consumer Credit Details” below. 

Home Equity Loans—Revolving HELOCs

As set forth in the table above, Citi had $14.8 billion of home equity loans as of December 31, 2017, of which $3.4 billion are fixed-rate home equity loans and $11.4 billion are extended under home equity lines of credit (Revolving HELOCs). Fixed-rate home equity loans are fully amortizing. Revolving HELOCs allow for amounts to be drawn for a period of time with the payment of interest only and then, at the end of the draw period, the outstanding amount is converted to an amortizing loan, or “reset” (the interest-only payment feature during the revolving period is standard for this product across the industry). Upon reset, these borrowers will be required to pay both interest, usually at a variable rate, and principal that amortizes typically over 20 years, rather than the standard 30-year amortization.

Of the Revolving HELOCs at December 31, 2017, $6.8 billion had reset (compared to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016) and $4.6 billion were still within their revolving period and had not reset (compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2016). The following chart indicates the FICO and combined loan-to-value (CLTV) characteristics of Citi’s Revolving HELOCs portfolio and the year in which they reset:

North America Home Equity Lines of Credit Amortization – Citigroup

Total ENR by Reset Year

In billions of dollars as of December 31, 2017

Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding.

Approximately 59% of Citi’s total Revolving HELOCs portfolio had reset as of December 31, 2017 (compared to 44% as of December 31, 2016). Of the remaining Revolving HELOCs portfolio, approximately 29% will reset during 2018. 

Citi’s customers with Revolving HELOCs that reset could experience “payment shock” due to the higher required payments on the loans. Citi currently estimates that the monthly loan payment for its Revolving HELOCs that reset during 2018 could increase on average by approximately $308, or 118%. Increases in interest rates could further increase these payments given the variable nature of the interest rates on these loans post-reset. Of the Revolving HELOCs that will reset during 2018, approximately $10 million, or 1%, of the loans have a CLTV greater than 100% as of December 31, 2017. Borrowers’ high loan-to-value positions, as well as the cost and availability of refinancing options, could limit borrowers’ ability to refinance their Revolving HELOCs as these loans reset.

Approximately 5.9% of the Revolving HELOCs that have reset as of December 31, 2017 were 30+ days past due, compared to 3.9% of the total outstanding home equity loan portfolio (amortizing and non-amortizing). This compared to 6.7% and 3.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. As newly amortizing loans continue to season, the delinquency rate of Citi’s total home equity loan portfolio could increase. In addition, resets to date have generally occurred during a period of historically low interest rates, which Citi believes has likely reduced the overall “payment shock” to the borrower. 

Citi monitors this reset risk closely and will continue to consider any potential impact in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves. In addition, management continues to review and take additional actions to offset potential reset risk, such as a borrower outreach program to provide reset risk education and proactively working with high-risk borrowers through a specialized single point of contact unit.

Consumer Loan Delinquency Amounts and Ratios

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.

(2)The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.

(3)The 90+ days past due balances for North America—Citi-branded and North America—Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(4)The 90+ days and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for GCB North America retail banking exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities since the potential loss predominantly resides within the U.S. government-sponsored entities. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $298 million ($0.7 billion), $327 million ($0.7 billion) and $491 million ($1.1 billion) at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (EOP loans have the same adjustment as above) were $88 million, $70 million and $87 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(5)Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(7)The December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, loans 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America exclude $4 million, $7 million and $11 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.

Consumer Loan Net Credit Losses and Ratios

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Average loans include interest and fees on credit cards.

(2)The ratios of net credit losses are calculated based on average loans, net of unearned income.

(3)As a result of Citigroup's entry into agreements in October 2016 to sell its Argentina and Brazil consumer banking businesses, these businesses were classified as HFS at the end of the fourth quarter 2016. Loans HFS are excluded from this table as they are recorded in Other assets. In addition, as a result of HFS accounting treatment, approximately $128 million and $42 million of net credit losses (NCLs) were recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table. The sales of the Argentina and Brazil consumer banking businesses were completed in the first and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. 

(4)As a result of the entry into an agreement to sell OneMain Financial (OneMain), OneMain was classified as HFS beginning March 31, 2015. Loans HFS are excluded from this table as they are recorded in Other assets. In addition, as a result of HFS accounting treatment, approximately $350 million of NCLs were recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) during 2015. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table. The OneMain sale was completed on November 15, 2015. 

(5)Asia includes average loans and NCLs in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Corporate Credit 

Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are typically large, multinational corporations that value Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with these clients that encompass multiple products, consistent with client needs, including cash management and trade services, foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory. 

Corporate Credit Portfolio

The following table sets forth Citi’s corporate credit portfolio within ICG (excluding private bank), before consideration of collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes drawn loans, overdrafts, bankers’ acceptances and leases. 

(2)Includes unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial guarantees.

Portfolio Mix—Geography, Counterparty and Industry

Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table shows the percentage by region based on Citi’s internal management geography:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived primarily through the use of validated statistical models, scorecard models and external agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss-given-default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.

Citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors, as necessary. Factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an 

obligor’s business and physical assets and, when relevant, consideration of cost-effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.

Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is also diversified by industry. The following table shows the allocation of Citi’s total corporate credit portfolio by industry:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. 

Credit Risk Mitigation

As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Other revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

As of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $16.3 billion, $22.2 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively, of the corporate credit portfolio was economically hedged. Citigroup’s expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans

There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary provides a general description of each category:

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) non-accrual status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal is doubtful.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.

•Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past due.

•North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services are not included because, under industry standards, credit card loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).

•Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

86

Non-Accrual Loans

The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed 

will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Excludes purchased distressed loans, as they are generally accreting interest. The carrying value of these loans was $167 million at December 31, 2017, $187 million at December 31, 2016, $250 million at December 31, 2015, $421 million at December 31, 2014 and $703 million at December 31, 2013.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

LIQUIDITY RISK

Overview

Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes in Citi’s credit ratings and geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity objectives are aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances, including potential Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory requirements, including, among other things, those related to resolution and resolution planning (for additional information, see “Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major categories:

•Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and

•the non-bank and other, which includes the parent holding company (Citigroup), Citi’s primary intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup (including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate level, Citigroup’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets (as discussed further below), even in 

times of stress. The liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary sources of funding include (i) deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, which are Citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding, (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated debt) primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.

As referenced above, Citi works to ensure that the tenor of these funding sources is sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The goal of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure that there is excess liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets. This reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before asset maturities or monetizations through sale. This excess liquidity is held primarily in the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table below. 

Citi’s Treasurer has overall responsibility for management of Citi’s HQLA. Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by Corporate Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-country treasurers. Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA is managed with emphasis on asset-liability management and entity-level liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall liquidity risk profile of Citi. The Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s CFO co-chair Citi’s Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which includes Citi’s Treasurer and other senior executives. ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors its performance. Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by ALCO.

High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions. 

(1) Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and primarily include government bonds from Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, India and Mexico. 

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s total HQLA increased year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in cash related to resolution planning. Sequentially, Citi’s HQLA decreased modestly, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by growth in deposits.

Citi’s HQLA as set forth above does not include Citi’s available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) of which Citi is a member, which was approximately $10 billion as of December 31, 2017 (compared to $16 billion as of September 30, 2017 and $21 billion as of December 31, 2016) and maintained by eligible collateral pledged to such banks. The HQLA also does not include Citi’s borrowing capacity at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank discount window or other central banks, which would be in addition to the resources noted above.

In general, Citi’s liquidity is fungible across legal entities within its bank group. Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, can lend to the Citi parent and broker-dealer entities in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of December 31, 2017, the capacity available for lending to these entities under Section 23A was approximately $15 billion, unchanged from both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, subject to certain eligible non-cash collateral requirements. 

Loans

As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow its GCB and ICG businesses, including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The table below sets forth the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the total end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

91

As set forth in the table above, end-of-period loans increased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter. On an average basis, loans increased 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average loans increased 3% year-over-year, driven by 5% aggregate across GCB and ICG. Within GCB, loans grew 4%, with growth across all regions. 

Average ICG loans increased 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by client-led growth in the private bank. Treasury and trade solutions and corporate lending increased 6% and 4%, respectively, both driven by growth in Asia and EMEA.

Average Corporate/Other loans decreased 32% year-over-year, driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets. 

Deposits

Deposits are Citi’s primary and lowest-cost funding source. The table below sets forth the average deposits, by business and/or segment, and the total end-of-period deposits for each of the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes deposits in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

End-of-period deposits increased 3% year-over-year and remained unchanged sequentially in the fourth quarter. On an average basis, deposits increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by 6% growth in TTS, as well as 4% aggregate growth in Asia GCB and Latin America GCB. North America GCB deposits declined 2% year-over-year, with half of the decline coming from lower escrow balances as a result of lower mortgage activity. Growth in checking deposits was more than offset by a reduction in money market balances, as clients transferred cash to investment accounts.

Long-Term Debt 

Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant component of Citi’s funding for the parent entities and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part to its multi-year contractual maturity structure. The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year (excluding remaining trust preferred securities outstanding) was approximately 6.8 years as of December 31, 2017, unchanged sequentially and a modest decline from 7.0 years from the prior year.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the parent includes senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-related debt is generally driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi’s parent entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank also includes benchmark senior debt, FHLB advances and securitizations. 

Long-Term Debt Outstanding

The following table sets forth Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet which, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.

(1)“Parent and other” includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of December 31, 2017 “parent and other” included $18.7 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries.

(2)Local country debt includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of their local operations.

(3)Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-branded credit card receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by an increase in senior debt at 

92

the parent, as well as increases in both Citibank benchmark senior debt and securitizations at the bank. In addition, the year-over-year increase in outstanding customer-related debt was driven by stronger customer demand and fewer maturities and redemptions. Sequentially, the increase was driven primarily by an increase in Citibank benchmark debt and securitizations at the bank.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs and assist it in meeting regulatory changes and requirements. During 2017, Citi repurchased an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion of its outstanding long-term debt, including early redemptions of FHLB advances. 

Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities

The table below details Citi’s long-term debt issuances and maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the periods presented:

93

Resolution Plan

Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), Citigroup has developed a “single point of entry” resolution strategy and plan under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On July 1, 2017, Citi submitted its 2017 resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC. On December 19, 2017, the Federal Reserve and FDIC informed Citi that (i) the agencies jointly decided that Citi’s 2017 resolution plan submission satisfactorily addressed the shortcomings identified in the 2015 resolution plan submission, and (ii) the agencies together did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies in the 2017 resolution plan submission. Citi’s next resolution plan submission is due July 1, 2019. For additional information on Citi’s resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

Under Citi’s resolution plan, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal entities (as defined in the public section of its 2017 resolution plan, which can be found on the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites) would remain operational and outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings. Citigroup believes its resolution plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. and global financial systems, while maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup’s creditors, including its unsecured long-term debt holders. In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve’s final total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes it has developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured long-term debt holders—bear any losses resulting from Citigroup’s bankruptcy.

In response to feedback received from the Federal Reserve and FDIC on Citigroup’s 2015 resolution plan, Citigroup took the following actions in connection with its 2017 resolution plan submission (which, as noted above, did not contain any shortcomings or deficiencies):

(i)Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

(ii)Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy proceedings (Citi Support Agreement); 

(iii)pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, including certain high-quality liquid assets and inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business as usual funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

•Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 

other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash needs; 

•in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will be required to contribute most of its remaining assets to Citicorp; and

(iv)the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, besides Citicorp’s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant to which Citicorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup during business as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more funding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a committed line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans to Citigroup. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)

In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released a final rule that imposes minimum external loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt (LTD) requirements on U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The intended purpose of the final rule is to facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effective date for all requirements under the final rule is January 1, 2019. While Citi believes that it meets the final minimum TLAC and LTD requirements as of December, 31, 2017, there are uncertainties regarding certain key aspects of the final rule. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risks” above. For additional discussion of the method 1 and method 2 GSIB capital surcharge methodology, see “Capital Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards” above. 

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule, U.S. GSIBs will be required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure and as described further below.

Minimum TLAC Requirements

The minimum TLAC requirement is the greater of (i) 18% of the GSIB’s RWA plus the then-applicable RWA-based TLAC buffer (see below) and (ii) 7.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure plus a leveraged-based TLAC buffer of 2% (i.e., 9.5%). The RWA-based TLAC buffer equals the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer (currently 0%), plus the GSIB’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the GSIB surcharge rule (2.0% for Citi as of January 1, 2018). Accordingly, Citi estimates its total current minimum TLAC requirement is 22.5% of RWA under the final rule. Pursuant to the final rule, TLAC may generally only consist of the GSIB’s (i) Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital issued directly by the bank holding company (excluding qualifying trust preferred securities) plus (ii) eligible LTD (as discussed below). Breach of either the RWA- 

94

or leveraged-based TLAC buffer would result in restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 

Minimum Eligible LTD Requirements

The minimum LTD requirement is the greater of (i) 6% of the GSIB’s RWA plus its capital surcharge as determined under method 2 of the GSIB surcharge rule (3.0% for Citi as of January 1, 2018), for a total current requirement of 9% of RWA for Citi, and (ii) 4.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure. 

Generally, under the final rule, eligible LTD is defined as the unpaid principal balance of unsecured, “plain vanilla” debt securities (i.e., would not include certain of Citi’s customer-related debt) issued directly by the bank holding company, governed by U.S. law, with a remaining maturity greater than one year and which provides for acceleration only upon the occurrence of insolvency or non-payment of principal or interest for 30 days or more. Further, pursuant to what has been referred to as the “haircut” provision, otherwise eligible LTD with a remaining maturity between one and two years is subject to a 50% haircut for purposes of meeting the minimum LTD requirement (although such LTD would continue to count at full value for purposes of the minimum TLAC requirement; eligible LTD with a remaining maturity of less than one year would not count toward either the minimum TLAC or eligible LTD requirement). The final rule provides that debt issued prior to December 31, 2016 with acceleration provisions other than those summarized above or governed by non-U.S. law is permanently grandfathered and may count as eligible LTD, assuming it otherwise meets the requirements of eligible LTD. 

Clean Holding Company Requirements

The final rule prohibits or limits certain financial arrangements at the bank holding company level, or what are referred to as “clean holding company” requirements. Pursuant to these requirements, Citi, as the bank holding company, is prohibited from having certain types of third-party liabilities, including short-term debt, certain derivatives and other qualified financial contracts, liabilities guaranteed by a subsidiary (i.e., upstream guarantees) and guarantees of subsidiary liabilities or similar arrangements, if the liability or guarantee includes a default right linked to the insolvency of the bank holding company (i.e., downstream guarantees with cross default provisions). In addition, the final rule limits third-party, non-contingent liabilities of the bank holding company (other than those related to TLAC or eligible LTD) to 5% of the U.S. GSIB’s outstanding TLAC. Examples of the types of liabilities subject to this 5% limit include structured notes and various operating liabilities, such as rent and obligations to employees, as well as litigation and similar liabilities.

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings

As referenced above, Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings generally include (i) secured funding transactions (securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or repos) and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings). 

Outside of secured funding transactions, Citi’s short-term borrowings increased both year-over-year (a 45% increase) and sequentially (a 17% increase), driven by an increase in FHLB borrowing, as Citi continued to optimize liquidity across its legal vehicles.

Secured Funding

Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both secured lending activity and a portion of securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities, which is typically collateralized by foreign government debt securities. Generally, daily changes in the level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $156 billion as of December 31, 2017 increased 10% from the prior-year period and declined 3% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured funding increased 5% from the prior-year period and decreased 3% sequentially, both driven by normal business activity. Average balances for secured funding were approximately $163 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other secured funding is secured by less-liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. The tenor of Citi’s matched book liabilities is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral, and stipulating financing tenor. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s secured funding of less-liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of December 31, 2017.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. 

95

Additionally, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Overall Short-Term Borrowings

The following table contains the year-end, average and maximum month-end amounts for the following respective short-term borrowings categories at the end of each of the three prior fiscal years:

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 

Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. Liquidity limits are set accordingly. To monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies, with several tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

In addition to internal liquidity stress metrics that Citi has developed for a 30-day stress scenario, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR, as calculated pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules.

Generally, the LCR is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of HQLA to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing HQLA by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30-day period, with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities, such as deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings, unused lending commitments and derivatives-related exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days. Banks are required to calculate an add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day period in determining the total amount of net outflows. The minimum LCR requirement is 100%, effective January 2017.

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule regarding LCR disclosures, effective April 1, 2017, Citi began to disclose LCR in the prescribed format. 

The table below sets forth the components of Citi’s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis.

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s LCR increased year-over-year, as the increase in the HQLA (as discussed above) more than offset an increase in modeled net outflows. The increase in modeled net outflows was primarily driven by changes in assumptions, including changes in methodology to better align Citi’s outflow assumptions with those embedded in its resolution planning. Sequentially, Citi’s LCR remained unchanged. 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel III NSFR requirement. 

The U.S.-proposed NSFR is largely consistent with the Basel Committee’s final NSFR rules. In general, the NSFR assesses the availability of a bank’s stable funding against a required level. A bank’s available stable funding would include portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding would be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Prescribed factors would be required to be applied to the various categories of asset and liabilities classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding would be required to be greater than 100%. While Citi believes that it is compliant with the proposed U.S. NSFR rules as of December 31, 2017, it will need to evaluate a final version of the rules, which are expected to be released during 2018. Citi expects that the NSFR final rules implementation period will be communicated along with the final version of the rules.

97

Credit Ratings

Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below sets forth the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of December 31, 2017. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) were “A2/P-1” at Moody’s, “A+/A-1” at Standard & Poor’s and “A+/F1” at Fitch as of December 31, 2017. The long-term and short-term ratings of CGMHI were “BBB+/A-2” at Standard & Poor’s and “A/F1” at Fitch as of December 31, 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Recent Credit Rating Developments

As of November 14, 2017, Moody's Investors Service has placed Citi on "Positive" outlook, citing Citi’s durable business model with a narrower geographic footprint and refined customer base targets, and the ability to demonstrate a strengthened risk asset profile as well as improved earnings stability.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades

Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivatives triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical, simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

 Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers

As of December 31, 2017, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2017. Other funding sources, such as securities financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2017, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity by approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.5 billion as of September 30, 2017, due to derivative triggers.

In total, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank, across all three major rating agencies, could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.2 billion, compared to $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 (see also Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As set forth under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, the liquidity resources of Citibank were approximately $369 billion and the liquidity resources of Citi’s non-bank and other entities were approximately $77 billion, for a total of approximately $446 billion as of December 31, 2017. These liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings from certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating 

98

actions available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts

In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential one-notch downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating by S&P could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. As of December 31, 2017, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $9.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $10.0 billion as of September 30, 2017 (as referenced in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank and Citibanamex entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Overview

Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities. 

Each business is required to establish, with approval from Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, Citi’s country and business Asset and Liability Committees and the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits.

Market risk emanates from both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. Trading portfolios comprise all assets and liabilities marked-to-market, with results reflected in earnings. Non-trading portfolios include all other assets and liabilities.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios  

Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest revenues, the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies. 

Net Interest Revenue at Risk

Net interest revenue, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the difference between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on the liabilities (including customer deposits or company borrowings). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets and liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates. 

 Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. 

Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions. For example, in rising interest rate scenarios, portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates. IRE assumes that businesses and/or Citi Treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes.

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, Citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, purchase fixed-rate securities, issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 

implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent. 

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated company-wide position. Citi’s client-facing businesses create interest-rate sensitive positions, including loans and deposits, as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools, such as Citi’s investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives, to target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting impacts, as well as in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.

Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities; and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on AOCI

Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in AOCI on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity.

100

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was $(182) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2017.

(2)Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(3)Results as of December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA position. Prior periods have not been restated. The estimated initial impact on Common Equity Tier I Capital ratio (bps) is calculated on a pre-tax basis prior to December 31, 2017. 

The 2017 decrease in the estimated impact to net interest revenue primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance sheet composition, including increases in loan balances and increased sensitivity in deposits, net of Citi Treasury positioning. The 2017 changes in the estimated impact to AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily reflected the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA position, net of changes in the composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and derivatives portfolio.

In the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates, Citi expects that the negative impact to AOCI would be offset in shareholders’ equity through the combination of expected incremental net interest 

revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time. As of December 31, 2017, Citi expects that the negative $4.9 billion impact to AOCI in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 21 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under four different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and Citi’s other currencies. While Citi also monitors the impact of a parallel decrease in interest rates, a 100 bps decrease in short-term rates is not meaningful, as it would imply negative interest rates in many of Citi’s markets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Each scenario in the table above assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. 

(1)Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)Results as of December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA position. 

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact to Citi’s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under scenario 2 as compared to scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediate term maturities.

101

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI and Capital

As of December 31, 2017, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.6 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, the Euro and the British pound sterling.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio are shown in the table below. For additional information on the changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Revenue/Expense and Net Interest Margin

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: All interest expense amounts include FDIC deposit insurance assessments.

(1)Net interest revenue includes the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%) of $496 million, $462 million and $489 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(2)Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together

 with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 

table above.

(3) Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest-earning assets.

Citi’s net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 remained largely unchanged versus the prior-year period at $11.2 billion ($11.4 billion on a taxable equivalent basis). Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citi’s net interest revenue was down slightly versus the prior-year period (down $50 million), as higher core accrual net interest revenue ($10.4 billion, up approximately 5% or $0.5 billion) was offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue ($0.5 billion, down approximately 46% or $0.4 billion) and lower net interest revenue associated with legacy assets in Corporate/Other ($0.3 billion, down approximately 34% or $0.1 billion). The increase in core accrual net interest revenue was driven mainly by the benefit of the December 2016, March 2017 and June 2017 interest rate increases and volume growth. 

Citi’s net interest revenue for the full-year remained largely unchanged versus the prior-year at $44.7 billion ($45.2 billion on a taxable equivalent basis). Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citi’s net interest revenue declined by approximately $0.5 billion, as higher core accrual net interest revenue (approximately $40.5 billion, up 5%, or $2.0 billion) was offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue (approximately $2.9 billion, down 37%, or $1.7 billion), largely driven by higher wholesale funding costs, and lower net interest revenue associated with legacy assets in Corporate/Other (approximately $1.2 billion, down 40%, or $0.8 billion). The increase in core accrual net interest revenue was primarily due to the benefit of the interest rate increases and volume growth.

103

Citi’s NIM was 2.63% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 9 bps from the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by lower trading-related NIM. On a full-year basis, Citi’s NIM was 2.70% on a taxable equivalent basis, compared to 2.86% in 2016, a decrease of 16 bps. Citi’s full-year core accrual NIM was 3.45%, a decline of 5 bps from the prior year, as higher core accrual net interest revenue was more than offset by balance sheet growth. (Citi’s core accrual net interest revenue and core accrual NIM are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these measures provide a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its business results.)

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated hedges, fair value option loans, hedges to the loan portfolio and the leverage finance pipeline within capital markets origination within ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, including, but not limited to:

•factor sensitivities; 

•value at risk (VAR); and 

•stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including trading mandates, permitted product 

lists and a new product approval process for complex products.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue (loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, as well as any associated hedges to that CVA. In addition, it excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading inventory. As shown in the chart, positive trading-related revenue was achieved for 99.6% of the trading days in 2017.

Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging derivatives is included in Trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected above.

109

Factor Sensitivities

Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury bill for a one-basis-point change in interest rates. Citi’s market risk management, within the Risk organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated, monitored and, in most cases, limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)

VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition, differences in VAR methodologies and differences in model parameters. As a result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and Validation” below), which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s VAR includes positions which are measured at fair value; it does not include investment securities classified as AFS or 

HTM. For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves approximately 350,000 market factors, making use of approximately 200,000 time series, with sensitivities updated daily, volatility parameters updated daily to weekly and correlation parameters updated monthly. The conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 20% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR increased from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, mainly due to changes in interest rate exposures from mark-to-market hedging activity against non-trading positions in the Markets and securities services businesses within ICG. The increase was partially offset by lower credit spread exposures and volatilities. Average trading and credit portfolio VAR was largely unchanged from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, mainly due to a reduction of the hedging related to lending activities offsetting the increase in average trading VAR. 

110

Year-end and Average Trading VAR and Trading and Credit Portfolio VAR 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each individual risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within each and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each individual risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 

(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

111

The table below provides the range of market factor VARs associated with Citi’s total trading VAR, inclusive of specific risk:

Note: No covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close-of-business dates.

The following table provides the VAR for ICG, excluding the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, hedges of CVA, fair value option loans and hedges to the loan portfolio:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

VAR Model Review and Validation

Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In addition, as part of the model validation process, product specific back-testing on portfolios is periodically completed and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, ICG business segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S. banking regulators.

Significant VAR model and assumption changes must be independently validated within Citi’s risk management organization. This validation process includes a review by Citi’s model validation group and further approval from its model validation review committee, which is composed of senior quantitative risk management officers. In the event of significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, as such, the model review and oversight process for both purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are 

not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under “Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes all trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing

In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceeded the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.

112

The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2017. During 2017, there were no back-testing exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR.

The difference between the 45.4% of days with buy-and-hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 99.6% of days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the histogram of daily trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss (1)—12 Months ended December 31, 2017

In millions of dollars

(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-related revenue above.

113

Stress Testing

Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises, and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments, especially those risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.

The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk. In general, changes in market values are defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions and market factors, changes in market values are defined over a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a two-month time horizon are those that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined.

114

OPERATIONAL RISK

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or human factors, or from external events. It includes risk of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations, but excludes strategic risk. Operational risk includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which Citi is involved, as well as compliance, conduct and legal risks.

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well as related support functions, and can result in losses arising from events associated with the following, among others:

•fraud, theft and unauthorized activity;

•employment practices and workplace environment;

•clients, products and business practices;

•physical assets and infrastructure; and

•execution, delivery and process management.

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. The Company’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of Citi’s businesses, the markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the competitive, economic and regulatory environment.

To anticipate, mitigate and control operational risk, Citi has established policies and a global framework for assessing, monitoring and communicating operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment across Citigroup. As part of this framework, Citi has defined its operational risk appetite and has established a manager’s control assessment (MCA) process (a process through which managers at Citi identify, monitor, measure, report on and manage risks and the related controls) to help managers self-assess significant operational risks and key controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design and/or operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate significant operational risks.

Each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework. The process for operational risk management includes the following steps:

•identify and assess key operational risks;

•design controls to mitigate identified risks;

•establish key risk indicators;

•implement a process for early problem recognition and timely escalation;

•produce comprehensive operational risk reporting; and

•ensure that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks.

As new products and business activities are developed, processes are designed, modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered.

An Operational Risk Management Committee has been established to provide oversight for operational risk across 

Citigroup and to provide a forum to assess Citi’s operational risk profile and ensure actions are taken so that Citi’s operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent with Citi’s risk appetite. The Committee seeks to ensure that these actions address the root causes that persistently lead to operational risk losses and create lasting solutions to minimize these losses. Members include Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s Head of Operational Risk and senior members of their organizations. These members cover multiple dimensions of risk management and include business and regional Chief Risk Officers and senior operational risk managers.

In addition, Risk management, including Operational Risk Management, works proactively with the businesses and other independent control functions to embed a strong operational risk management culture and framework across Citi. Operational Risk Management engages with the businesses to ensure effective implementation of the Operational Risk Management framework by focusing on (i) identification, analysis and assessment of operational risks, (ii) effective challenge of key control issues and operational risks and (iii) anticipation and mitigation of operational risk events.

Information about the businesses’ operational risk, historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area. The information is summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to the Audit Committee of Citi’s Board of Directors.

Operational risk is measured and assessed through risk capital. Projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are also required as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.

COMPLIANCE RISK

Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, local, national, or cross-border laws, rules, or regulations, Citi's internal policies, or other relevant standards of conduct or the risk of harming customers, clients or the integrity of the market.

As the champion of responsible finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management’s primary objectives are to:

•Maintain a framework that facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies and procedures and relevant standards of conduct;

•Support Citi’s operations by assisting in the management of compliance risk across products, business lines, functions and geographies, supported by globally consistent systems and processes; and

•Drive and embed a risk culture of compliance, control and ethical conduct throughout Citi.

Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) Program

To anticipate, mitigate and control compliance risk, Citi has established a global independent compliance risk management framework for assessing, monitoring and communicating compliance risks. To achieve this mission, ICRM seeks to:

•Communicate a strong culture of compliance, control and ethical conduct.

•Identify compliance risk and AML compliance risk for which each business or function has responsibility, including through compliance risk assessments, and set standards with respect to these requirements.

•Identify regulatory changes and oversee the assessment of impact, as well as capture and monitor adherence to existing regulatory requirements, providing the businesses with guidance and support as needed in accordance with the regulatory change management standard.

•Provide credible challenge to the first-line units in their assessment and management of compliance risk.

•Perform compliance assurance activities to oversee adherence to applicable requirements.

•Issue policies, procedures and other documentation that set standards for employees in conducting Citi’s business and provide oversight in the application of those standards to specific circumstances.

•Manage regulatory examinations and other supervisory activity impacting Citi’s businesses and global control functions in accordance with the regulatory exam management governance and process standards.

•Provide training to support the effective execution of roles and responsibilities related to the identification, control, reporting and escalation of matters related to compliance risks.

•Report to senior management and the Citigroup Board of Directors or their designated committees on the effectiveness of the processes and standards implemented to manage compliance risk.

•Escalate through the appropriate channels, which may include governance forums, the results of monitoring, testing, reporting or other oversight activities that may represent a violation of law, regulation, policy or other significant compliance risk and take reasonable action to see that the matter is appropriately identified, tracked and resolved, including through the issuance of corrective action plans against the first line of defense.

•Advise, as needed or when required by policy, on the degree to which existing and new business processes, methodologies, performance, products, services, transactions or customer segments satisfy Citi standards and are consistent with the prudent management of compliance risk.

CONDUCT RISK

Citi places conduct risk within compliance risk and defines conduct risk as the risk that Citi’s employees or agents may—intentionally or through negligence—harm customers, clients, or the integrity of the markets, and thereby the integrity of the Company. Citi manages its exposure to conduct risk through a global conduct risk program that is implemented across its businesses and functions. The conduct risk program requires all three lines of defense to understand and perform certain key roles and responsibilities. The first line of defense owns and manages the risks inherent in or arising from the business, including conduct risk, and is responsible for managing, minimizing and mitigating those risks. The second line of defense takes a risk-based approach to assess, advise on, monitor and test current and emerging significant conduct risks across products, businesses, functions, countries and regions and works to enhance the effectiveness of controls. The third line of defense provides independent risk-based assurance over the conduct risk program based upon a risk-based audit plan and audit methodology as approved by the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Each business and function identifies its significant conduct risks through a diagnostic process that includes broadly understanding their potential significant conduct risks in the context of their overall activities, identifying and flagging their significant conduct risks and related controls and incorporating the results of this diagnostic process into their annual risk assessment process. Citi also manages its conduct risk through other initiatives, including various culture-related efforts. 

LEGAL RISK

Citi views legal risk as qualitative in nature because it does not lend itself to an appetite expressed through a numerical limit and it cannot be reliably estimated or measured based on forecasts. As such, Citi seeks to manage this risk in accordance with its qualitative risk appetite principle, which generally states that activities in which Citi engages and the risks those activities generate must be consistent with Citi’s underlying commitment to the principle of responsible finance and managed with a goal to eliminate, minimize or mitigate this risk, as practicable. To accomplish this goal, legal risk is managed in accordance with the overall framework described in greater detail in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above.

REPUTATIONAL RISK

Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and Citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values, including the importance of protecting Citi’s reputation, to its employees, customers and investors. The responsibility for maintaining Citi’s reputation is shared by all employees, who are guided by Citi’s code of conduct. Employees are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in every action they take and issues that present potential franchise, reputational and/or systemic risks are to be appropriately escalated. The business practices committees for each of Citi’s businesses and regions are part of the governance infrastructure Citi has in place to properly 

116

review business activities, sales practices, product design, perceived conflicts of interest and other potential franchise or reputational risks that arise in these businesses and regions. These committees may also raise potential franchise, reputational or systemic risks for due consideration by the business practices committee at the corporate level. All of these committees, which are composed of Citi’s most senior executives, provide the guidance necessary for Citi’s business practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and ethical behavior consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition.

STRATEGIC RISK

Citi senior management, led by Citi’s CEO, is responsible for the development and execution of the strategy of the Company. Significant strategic actions are reviewed and approved by, or notified to, the Citigroup and Citibank Board of Directors, as appropriate. The Citigroup Board of Directors holds an annual strategic meeting and annual regional strategic meetings, and receives business presentations at its regular meetings, in order to monitor management’s execution of Citi’s strategy. At the business level, business heads are accountable for the interpretation and execution of the Company-wide strategy, as it applies to their area, including decisions on new business and product entries.

The management of strategic risk rests upon the foundational elements that include an annual financial operating plan encompassing all businesses, products and geographies and defined financial and operating targets, derived from the operating plan, which can be monitored throughout the year in order to assess strategic and operating performance. Strategic risk is monitored through various mechanisms, including regular updates to senior management and the Board of Directors on performance against the operating plan, quarterly business reviews between the Citi CEO and business and regional CEOs in which the performance and risks of each major business and region are discussed, ongoing reporting to senior management and executive management scorecards.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures 

The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by

country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2017. The total exposure as of December 31, 2017 to the top 25 countries disclosed below, in combination with the U.S., would represent, approximately 94% of Citi’s exposure to all countries. For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 24% of corporate

loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled

entities (25% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of

the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties.

Approximately 80% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of

the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade

as of December 31, 2017. Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

For a discussion of uncertainties arising as a result of the terms and other uncertainties resulting from the U.K.’s potential exit from the EU, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)ICG loans reflect funded corporate loans and private bank loans, net of unearned income. As of December 31, 2017, private bank loans in the table above totaled $23.5 billion, concentrated in Singapore ($7.0 billion), Hong Kong ($6.8 billion) and the U.K. ($5.1 billion). 

118

(2)GCB loans include funded loans in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia related to businesses that were transferred to Corporate/Other as of January 1, 2016. The sales of the Argentina and Brazil consumer banking businesses were completed in the first and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. 

(3)Other funded includes other direct exposure such as accounts receivable, loans held-for-sale, other loans in Corporate/Other and investments accounted for under the equity method. 

(4)Unfunded exposure includes unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 

(5)Net mark-to-market on derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Exposures are shown net of collateral and inclusive of CVA. Includes margin loans. 

(6)Investment securities include securities available-for-sale, recorded at fair market value, and securities held-to-maturity, recorded at historical cost. 

(7)Trading account assets are shown on a net basis and include issuer risk on cash products and derivative exposure where the underlying reference entity/issuer is located in that country.

Argentina

As of December 31, 2017, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $954 million, compared to $725 million at December 31, 2016. 

Citi uses the Argentine peso as the functional currency in Argentina and translates its financial statements into U.S. dollars using the official exchange rate as published by the Central Bank of Argentina. The impact of devaluations of the Argentine peso on Citi’s net investment in Argentina, net of hedges, is reported as a translation loss in stockholders’ equity.

Although Citi currently uses the Argentine peso as the functional currency, an increase in inflation resulting in a cumulative three-year inflation rate of 100% or more would result in a change in the functional currency to the U.S. dollar. Citi has historically based its evaluation of the cumulative three-year inflation rate on the CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation statistics published by INDEC, the Argentine government’s statistics agency. However, for the period from November 2015 to April 2016, INDEC did not publish CPI statistics, which has led to uncertainty about the cumulative three-year inflation rate. As of December 31, 2017, Citi evaluated the available CPI statistics as well as inflation statistics published by the Argentine Central Bank and concluded that Argentina’s cumulative three-year inflation rate had not reached 100%. However, uncertainty continues as to the cumulative three-year inflation rate, and additional information received in future periods could result in a change of functional currency to the U.S. dollar in 2018. 

While a change in the functional currency to the U.S. dollar would not result in any immediate gains or losses to Citi, it would result in future changes in the translation of Citi’s Argentine peso-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars being recorded in earnings instead of stockholders’ equity.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local Country Assets

Citi’s cross-border disclosures are based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the FFIEC key reporting guidelines:

•Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor, counterparty, collateral, issuer or guarantor, as applicable. 

•Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional amounts. 

•Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges.

•The netting of long and short positions for AFS securities and trading portfolios is not permitted. 

•Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 

•Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in some cases, significantly, from period to period. As an example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings, all else being equal.

119

The tables below set forth each country whose total outstandings exceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Non-bank financial institutions.

(2)Included in total outstanding.

(3)Total outstanding includes cross-border claims on third parties, as well as local country assets. Cross-border claims on third parties include cross-border loans, securities, deposits with banks and other monetary assets, as well as net revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products.

(4)Commitments (not included in total outstanding) include legally binding cross-border letters of credit and other commitments and contingencies as defined by the FFIEC guidelines. The FFIEC definition of commitments includes commitments to local residents to be funded with local currency liabilities originated within the country.

(5)CDS are not included in total outstanding.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

This section contains a summary of Citi’s most significant accounting policies and accounting standards that have been issued, but are not yet effective. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of Citigroup’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi’s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

Valuations of Financial Instruments

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. Substantially all of 

these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on Citi’s 

Consolidated Balance Sheet.
