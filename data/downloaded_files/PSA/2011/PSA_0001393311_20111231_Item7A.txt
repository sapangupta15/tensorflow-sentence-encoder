ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

To limit our exposure to market risk, we are capitalized primarily with preferred and common equity. Our preferred shares are redeemable at our option generally five years after issuance, but the holder has no redemption option. Our debt is our only market-risk sensitive portion of our capital structure, which totals $398.3 million and represents 4.8% of the book value of our equity at December 31, 2011. 

We have foreign currency exposures related to our investment in Shurgard Europe, which has a book value of $375.5 million at December 31, 2011. We also have a loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, which is denominated in Euros, totaling â‚¬311.0 million ($402.7 million) at December 31, 2011. 

The table below summarizes annual debt maturities and weighted-average interest rates on our outstanding debt at the end of each year and fair values required to evaluate our expected cash-flows under debt agreements and our sensitivity to interest rate changes at December 31, 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands).
