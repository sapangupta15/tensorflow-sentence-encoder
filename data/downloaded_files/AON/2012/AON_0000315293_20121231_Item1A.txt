Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

 The risk factors set forth below reflect certain risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain "forward-looking statements" as discussed in the "Business" Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.  

 The following are certain risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.  

 Risks relating to the Company generally  

 Competitive Risks   

 An overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of each of our business lines.   

 The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Risk Solutions business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premium charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in industry parlance as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect our Risk Solutions business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients. A growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients, by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business or by exposing us to error and omissions claims, referred to here as E&O claims.  

10 

 The results of our HR Solutions business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations, our revenues and/or collectibility of receivables could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues from many of our outsourcing contracts depend upon the number of our clients' employees or the number of participants in our clients' employee benefit plans and could be adversely affected by layoffs. We may also experience decreased demand for our services as a result of postponed or terminated outsourcing of human resources functions or reductions in the size of our clients' workforce. Reduced demand for our services could increase price competition. Some portion of our services may be considered by our clients to be more discretionary in nature and thus, demand for these services may be impacted by reductions in economic activity.   

 We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.   

 We believe that competition in our Risk Solutions segment is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength and ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.  

 Our HR Solutions segment competes with a large number of independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world. Many of our competitors in this area are expanding the services they offer or reducing prices in an attempt to gain additional business. Additionally, some competitors have established, and are likely to continue to establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs.  

 Competitors in each of our lines of business may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, stronger international presence and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have. In addition, new competitors, alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share, and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop. Large and well-capitalized competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster, or price their services more aggressively. They may also compete for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do. To respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of service provided to clients, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin.  

 Financial Risks   

 Uncertainty surrounding the ability of various European countries to satisfy their debt obligations, questions surrounding the future of the Eurozone, instability surrounding economic conditions in Europe and the Euro generally could each have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects for growth.   

 Continued concerns regarding the ability of certain European countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets. This instability has in turn led to questions regarding the future viability of the Euro as the common currency for the area as various scenarios could result in some countries choosing to return to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies. This uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in Europe, and if it continues to deteriorate, may have a material negative impact  

11 

on our European business as well as that of our clients. Further, any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the Euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets or profitability denominated in that currency, potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our Euro Credit Facility.  

 We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we are constantly monitoring and managing exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the Euro currency suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.   

 Our pension obligations could adversely affect our shareholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.   

 To the extent that the pension obligations associated with our major plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In certain years there have been declines in interest rates. As a result of lower interest rates and investment returns, the present value of plan liabilities increased faster than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans.  

 We currently plan to contribute approximately $548 million to our major pension plans in 2013, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2012 were $638 million, which was an increase of $161 million when compared to 2011.  

 The significance of our worldwide pension plans means that our pension contributions and expense are comparatively sensitive to various market factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year.  

 The periodic revision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic pension expense or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future changes in the funded status of our plans, shareholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those that have been estimated.   

 We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.   

 As of December 31, 2012, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $4.2 billion. The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures.  

 We have two primary committed credit facilities outstanding, one contracted in the U.S., and the other contracted in Europe. The U.S. facility totals $400 million and matures in March 2017. It is intended as a back-up against commercial paper or to address capital needs. The Euro facility totals €650 million ($860 million based on exchange rates at December 31, 2012) and matures in October 2015. It is intended to be used as a revolving working capital line. At December 31, 2012, we had no borrowings under either of these credit facilities. Both facilities require certain representations and warranties to be made before drawing and both have similar financial covenants. At December 31, 2012, we could make all representations and warranties and were in compliance with all financial covenants.  

12 

 A substantial portion of our outstanding debt contains financial and other covenants. The terms of this indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.  

 Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. It will also reduce the availability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.  

 If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.   

 A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.   

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, and reduce our financial flexibility. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2012 were BBB+ with a stable outlook (Standard & Poor's and Fitch, Inc.) and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody's Investor Services). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody's).   

 Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   

 Operating funds available for corporate use and funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $637 million and $4.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2012. These funds are reported in Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2012, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $165 million. Changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. For example, changes in interest rates directly affect our income from cash balances and short-term investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions, financial stability of the investees and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our long-term investments. And, our cash holdings, including cash held in our fiduciary capacity, are subject to the credit, liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties.  

 While we regularly measure, monitor and mitigate our exposure to these risks, a deterioration in the credit or liquidity of any of these counterparties, particularly if sudden or severe, could in turn adversely affect us. We also assess our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairments. For investments in which the fair value is less than the carrying value and the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  

13 

 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.   

 Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our five largest exposures are the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Indian Rupee. Historically, more than half of our operating income has been non-U.S. Dollar denominated, therefore, a weaker U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, would produce more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements. We also face transactional exposure between the U.S. Dollar revenue and British Pound expense. In the U.K., part of our revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, although our operating expenses are denominated in British Pounds. Therefore, a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound would produce more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements. We would also benefit from a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the Indian Rupee. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have significant currency volatility. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost to our customers in foreign markets where we receive our revenue in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could potentially affect demand for our services.  

 Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.   

 We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our Aon Hewitt restructuring plan.   

 In 2010, after completion of the acquisition of Hewitt, we announced a global restructuring plan referred to as the Aon Hewitt Plan. The Aon Hewitt Plan, which will continue into 2013, is intended to streamline operations across the combined organization. The Aon Hewitt Plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $325 million through the end of the plan, all of which will be included in our Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily encompassing workforce reduction and real estate rationalization costs. The total estimated cost of $325 million consists of approximately $192 million in employee termination costs and approximately $133 million in real estate rationalization costs. An estimated 2,000 positions globally, predominantly non-client facing, are expected to be eliminated as part of the Aon Hewitt Plan. As of December 31, 2012, in excess of 1,900 jobs have been eliminated under this plan and $255 million of charges have been recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 We expect to achieve total annual savings of $355 million in 2013, including approximately $280 million of annual savings related to the Aon Hewitt Plan, of which $52 million is expected to be achieved in Risk Solutions and $228 million is expected to be achieved in HR Solutions, and additional savings in areas such as information technology, procurement and public company costs. Actual total savings, costs and timing may vary materially from those estimated due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the restructuring plan. We therefore cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.   

 The expected benefits of our Redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by related costs.   

 There can be no assurance that all of the goals of our Redomestication will be achievable, particularly as the achievement of the benefits are, in many important respects, subject to factors that we do not control. These factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors, analysts, and U.K. and U.S. taxing authorities.  

14 

 Our effective tax rates and the benefits anticipated from the Redomestication are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the U.K. and the U.S., the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations (especially as between the British pound and the U.S. dollar), and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of the U.K. or the U.S., including changes in interest rates. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be (and, in fact, often seem to be) interrelated, and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.  

 The Redomestication will result in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses and require us to incur some new expenses, including those related to relocating employees to our U.K. offices, complying with U.K. corporate and tax laws, and holding board meetings in the U.K. These additional expenses could serve to reduce or offset the benefits realized from the Redomestication.   

 Despite our Redomestication, we may nonetheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.   

 Generally for U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation is considered a tax resident in the place of its incorporation. Because we are incorporated under U.K. law, we should be a U.K. corporation and a U.K. tax resident under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the "Code") generally provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. which acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes if former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80 percent (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition and the expanded affiliated group does not have "substantial business activities" in the country in which the acquiring foreign corporation is organized. Pursuant to the Redomestication, we acquired directly or indirectly all of Aon Corporation's assets, and immediately after the merger, former Aon Corporation stockholders held 100 percent of the Company by reason of their prior stock ownership of Aon Corporation. As a result, our expanded affiliated group must have substantial business activities in the U.K. after the merger in order for the Company not to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874. There is no applicable "safe harbor" or other guidance that confirms whether an expanded affiliated group's business activities in a country of incorporation are deemed to be substantial. Therefore, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") could interpret the Section 7874 "anti-inversion" rules so as to treat the Company as a U.S. corporation after the consummation of the merger and that such an IRS position would be sustained in litigation. Moreover, the United States Congress, the IRS, the United Kingdom Parliament or U.K. tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position. Retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past, and there can be no assurance that any such provisions, if enacted or promulgated, would not have retroactive application to us, the merger or any subsequent actions.  

 Although we believe we should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874, there is no certainty that the IRS will not assert a contrary position, in which case, we could become involved in a tax controversy with the IRS regarding possible additional U.S. tax liability. If we are unsuccessful in resolving any such tax controversy in our favor, we would likely not realize the tax savings we expect to achieve through reorganization.  

15 

 Our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we become subject to U.S. corporate income tax.   

 We and our other non-U.S. affiliates will conduct our operations in a manner intended to ensure that we and our non-U.S. affiliates do not engage in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. However, on the assumption that we are not treated as a U.S. corporation by virtue of Code Section 7874 described above, if we or any of our non-U.S. affiliates is or are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., we or our non-U.S. affiliates would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S. If this occurs, our results of operations may be adversely affected. In any event, Aon Corporation and any U.S. subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on any worldwide income of any such U.S. company, and Aon Corporation's foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.   

 HM. Revenue and Customs, or HMRC, may disagree with our conclusions on the U.K. tax treatment of the merger, or relevant U.K. legislation may be subject to change.   

 We have obtained a ruling from HMRC that, following the Redomestication, the "temporary period exemption" from the U.K.'s controlled foreign company rules will apply such that, subject to certain conditions and limitations based on our facts and circumstances, we will not be subject to tax on the profits of any controlled company that is resident in a foreign jurisdiction under the controlled foreign company ("CFC") rules until 24 months after the end of the accounting period in which the merger occurs, subject to any changes of legislation. On March 29, 2012, the U.K. Government published the Finance (No 4) Bill, which proposed major reforms to the CFC rules for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The proposed transitional rules would preserve the temporary period exemption for exempt periods beginning before the new rules come into force. While HMRC cannot provide any assurance in respect of the application of legislation that has not been enacted, we are of the view based on the Government's proposals and published draft legislation that the new CFC rules should not have a material adverse effect on our tax treatment in the U.K. if enacted in their current form. However, to the extent that the Finance (No 4) Bill is enacted in a form different to that currently proposed, this may result in additional corporation tax liabilities becoming payable following implementation of the revised legislation.  

 We have also obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax ("SDRT") consequences of the merger and as a result believe that we have satisfied all stamp duty and SDRT payment and filing obligations in connection with the issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the merger.  

 Further, if HMRC disagrees with our view of any issues in respect of which no ruling has been obtained, it may take the position that material U.K. corporation tax or SDRT liabilities or amounts on account thereof are payable by any one or more of these companies as a result of the Redomestication, in which case we expect that we would contest such assessment. To contest such assessment, we may be required to remit cash or provide security of the amount in dispute, or such lesser amount as permitted under U.K. law and acceptable to HMRC, to prevent HMRC from seeking enforcement actions pending the dispute of such assessment. If we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could be materially adverse to us. To the extent that HMRC has not provided (and we have not requested) a ruling on the U.K. tax aspects of the merger, there can be no assurance that HMRC will agree with our interpretation of the U.K. tax aspects of the merger or any related matters associated therewith.  

16 

 Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.   

 We are subject to income taxes in the U.K., U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation, our global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the transfer pricing of revenues and costs, acquisitions and dispositions, and the portion of the income of non-U.S. subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities.  

 We believe that our Redomestication should significantly improve our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the U.K. has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject non-U.K. earnings to U.K. tax when such earnings are repatriated to the U.K. in the form of dividends from non-U.K. subsidiaries. This should allow us to optimize our capital allocation and deploy efficient fiscal structures. However, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as changes in U.S. and other tax laws, treaties and regulations. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the U.K. and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate.  

 We also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our results of operations to suffer.   

 Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.   

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to restructuring, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, contingencies, share-based payments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows. Changes in accounting standards could also have an adverse impact on our future Consolidated Financial Statements.   

 We may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.   

 Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill  

17 

is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. There can be no assurances that goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges will not be required in the future, which could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.   

 We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.   

 Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses. While our principal subsidiaries currently are not limited by material contractual restrictions on their abilities to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their capital stock to us, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. These regulatory restrictions may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or advance to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, due to differences in tax rates, repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.K. through the U.S. could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us.  

 Legal and Regulatory Risks   

 We are subject to errors and omissions ("E&O") claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of a business line or the Company as a whole.   

 We assist our clients with various matters, including placing of insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, providing investment consulting and asset management services, and outsourcing various human resources functions. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, the failure to give error-free advice in our consulting business or the failure to correctly execute transactions in the human resources outsourcing business. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.  

 We have historically purchased, and continue to purchase insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant, and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

18 

 The ultimate outcome of these claims, lawsuits and proceedings cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future Statements of Financial Position, results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.  

 In addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. Any anticipated amounts that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications.   

 Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.   

 Our businesses are subject to extensive U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. governmental regulation and oversight, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings.  

 With respect to our Risk Solutions segment, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or managing general underwriting operations and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.  

 Although the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and U.S. federal taxation, trade sanctions regulation and the FCPA, do affect the insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted, or proposed to be adopted, by the U.S. federal government, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA") have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.  

 Services provided in our HR Solutions segment are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because aspects of the client's business are regulated, thereby indirectly impacting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. Changes in government regulations in the United States affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare (such as medical) plans, defined contribution (such as 401(k)) plans, defined benefit (such as pension) plans or payroll delivery, may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services. Recently, we have seen regulatory initiatives contribute to companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or de-emphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans. If organizations  

19 

discontinue or de-emphasize defined benefit plans more rapidly than we anticipate, the results of our business could be adversely affected.  

 Recently, our HR Solutions business has made significant investments in health care exchanges and other product development to assist clients in de-risking their health benefits and migrate them towards a defined contribution model versus a defined benefit model. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from these laws and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in the HR Solutions segment, could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer-sponsored health care in response to the newly enacted legislation, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  

 With respect to our non-U.S. operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses and increased training and employee expenses. In connection with our 2012 reorganization under a newly formed U.K. holding company, for example, we will likely incur increased costs from complying with additional local regulations and requirements such as those arising under the U.K. Companies Act.  

 Moreover, U.S. legislation, such as the FCPA and FATCA discussed above, impact our non-U.S. operations by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and non-compliance with those laws even by our non-U.S. subsidiaries can nonetheless render us liable for penalties and subject us to heightened oversight. For example, in 2011, we entered into settlement agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") relating to inadequate controls for potential FCPA violations. Those settlement agreements imposed monetary fines and the agreement with the DOJ requires that we bring to the attention of the DOJ any criminal conduct by, or criminal investigations of, Aon or any of its senior managerial employees as well as any administrative proceeding or civil action brought by any governmental authority that alleges fraud or corruption by Aon. Failure to comply with this requirement or reporting to the DOJ of any act or omission covered by this requirement could subject Aon to further penalties and regulatory scrutiny.  

 In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked and be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.  

 In addition, new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us. These developments include:   

the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;  

changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;   

the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage;  

changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution and defined benefit plans, and investment consulting and asset management;  

additional regulations promulgated by the FSA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate; or   

20 

additional requirements respecting data privacy and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which data can be used by us to develop or further our product offerings.   

Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Likewise, increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.   

 We may in the future be subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, which may deter potential acquirers from proceeding with a takeover offer that could be beneficial to shareholders.   

 In the United Kingdom, takeover offers for certain public companies are regulated by the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, or the Takeover Code, which is administered by the Takeover Panel. Currently, the Takeover Code applies to public companies that have their registered offices in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man if their securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the United Kingdom or on a stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. The Takeover Code also applies to public companies that have their registered office in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man but whose securities are not admitted to trading on one of the markets mentioned above if the Takeover Panel determines generally based on the residency of the company's directors  the so-called residency test  that the company has its place of central management and control in the U.K., the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. In connection with our redomestication, the Takeover Panel confirmed that based on the residency test and on the expected residence of our directors and management, the Takeover Code would not apply to us.  

 In July 2012, the Takeover Panel published a consultation paper setting out proposed amendments to the Takeover Code, including a proposal to eliminate the residency test. If this proposal is adopted, we would likely become subject to the Takeover Code.  

 In summary, the Takeover Code sets out binding rules that provide a framework within which takeovers are required to be conducted and its approach differs from, and in some cases conflicts with, the approach set forth under the rules of the SEC to which we will remain subject in any event. If we become subject to the Takeover Code, we will be required to comply with these additional controls with respect to the conduct of any takeover offer for our ordinary shares, and these additional controls may create uncertainty in the process by which a takeover offer must be executed. These additional controls and attendant uncertainty may affect the willingness of potential acquirers to proceed with a takeover offer that may otherwise be beneficial to shareholders.   

 As a result of increased shareholder approval requirements, we have less flexibility as an English public limited company with respect to certain aspects of capital management.   

 English law imposes some restrictions on certain corporate actions by which previously, as a Delaware corporation, we were not constrained. For example, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. This authorization would need to be renewed by our shareholders upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). Our articles of association authorize the allotment of additional shares, and renewal of such authorization for additional five year terms may be sought more frequently.  

 English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up  

21 

to five years from the date of adoption of the articles of association, if the exclusion is contained in the articles of association, or from the date of the shareholder resolution, if the exclusion is by shareholder resolution; in either case, this exclusion would need to be renewed upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). Our articles of association exclude preemptive rights, and renewal of such exclusion for additional five year terms may be sought more frequently.  

 English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of "off market purchases" without the prior approval of 75 percent of shareholders by special resolution. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. English law prohibits us from conducting "on market purchases" as our shares are not traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Special resolutions were adopted to permit "off market purchases" prior to the effective time of the merger. These special resolutions will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) but may be sought more frequently for additional five year terms.   

 The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult.   

 Because we are a public limited company incorporated under English law, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for U.S. judgments obtained against Aon Corporation. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.   

 We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the United States in order to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.   

 There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under the U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied in order for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment:   

the U.S. judgment must be for a debt or definite sum of money;  

the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive;  

the U.S. court must, in the circumstances of the case, have had jurisdiction according to the English rules of private international law;  

the U.S. judgment must not have been obtained by fraud;  

the enforcement of the U.S. judgment must not be contrary to U.K. public policy; and   

the proceedings in which the U.S. judgment was obtained must not have been conducted contrary to the rules of natural justice.   

 Operational and commercial risks   

 Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other professional personnel.   

 We depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy. The unexpected loss of services of any of our senior executive officers could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Competition for  

22 

experienced professional personnel is intense, and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.   

 Our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.   

 Our operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in, and sourcing from, foreign countries, including:   

the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries, including risks associated with a concentration of operations in certain geographic regions;  

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  

imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;  

imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;   

difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;  

hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;  

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;   

longer payment cycles;  

greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection;  

the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;  

insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions;  

ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;   

restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and  

trade barriers.    

 The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   

 We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tornadoes, and pandemic health events, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our Risk Solutions professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.  

 A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.  

23 

 As an example, in October 2012, Superstorm Sandy made landfall on the Northeast coast of the United States. The storm caused widespread disruption and dislocation across five states but New York and New Jersey in particular. One of our largest offices, located in lower Manhattan was closed until January 7, 2013, requiring us to relocate a large number of our employees procure temporary workspace in the area and provide for enhanced remote working and information technology support arrangements. Given that lower Manhattan serves as a hub to the insurance industry, the storm impacted many of our clients, carriers and vendors as well, some of whose operations were severely disrupted. While we believe our relocation measures and business continuity plans allowed us to effectively continue to operate our critical business functions, it is possible that the disruption of the storm on our operations and that of our clients, carriers and vendors may result in a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  

 Also, through our merger with Benfield, we acquired Benfield's equity stake in certain Florida-domiciled homeowner insurance companies. We maintain ongoing agreements to provide modeling, actuarial, and consulting services to these insurance companies. These firms' financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing their underwriting reserves differ from actual experience. Reserve estimates represent informed judgments based on currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause estimates to vary. Additionally, a natural disaster occurring in Florida could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims relating to these existing service agreements.   

 Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.   

 Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. Superstorm Sandy, for example, impacted several of our locations in the Northeast United States, resulting in interruptions to our operations and information technology system infrastructure. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.  

 Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.  

 We regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.  

24 

 We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and operating results.   

 We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the company and some are outsourced. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly. Although we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition, we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses and similar information technology violations in the ordinary course of business. We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.   

 Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.   

 One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees' and clients' confidential and proprietary information and in the case of our HR Solutions clients, the personal data of their employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  

 Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data privacy are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.   

 Implementation of changes to the methods in which we internally process and monitor transactions and activities may encounter delays or other problems, which could adversely impact our accounting and financial reporting processes.   

 Our businesses require that we process and monitor, on a regular basis, a very large number of transactions and other activities, many of which are highly complex, across numerous markets in several different currencies using different systems. Initiatives underway that are designed to improve these functions will alter how we gather, organize and internally report these transactions and activities. To the extent these initiatives are not implemented properly or encounter problems or delays in their implementation, they may adversely impact our accounting and financial reporting processes, as well as our invoicing and collection efforts.  

25 

 Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools. Conversely, investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments.   

 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements. For example, we have invested significantly in the development of GRIP, a repository of global insurance placement information, which we use to drive better results for our clients in the insurance placement process. Our competitors are seeking to develop competing databases, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Likewise, we have invested significantly in our HR BPO business and platform. Innovations in software, cloud computing or other technologies that alter how these services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments.  

 On the other hand, we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel product offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets. Nevertheless, for those efforts to produce meaningful value, we are reliant on a number of other factors, some of which our outside of our control. For example, our HR Solutions segment has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the U.S. manage their growing health care expenses. But in order for these exchanges to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable to participate in, and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances.   

 If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities and damage to our professional reputation or legal liability.   

 We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality brokering, risk management and HR solutions, so that we can understand our clients' needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to their needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share information amongst themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.  

 The nature of much of our work, especially our actuarial services in our HR Solutions business, involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our investment consulting business, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data entry or management errors. A client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice. And, in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums, claims arising from our professional services may  

26 

produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business.   

 Our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.   

 Our Risk Solutions business collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are remitted to the insureds. Similarly, part of our HR Solutions' outsourcing business handles payroll processing for several of our clients. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients and, in the case of HR Solutions, their employees, while payroll is being processed. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions or errors relating to transaction processing. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.   

 In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy, we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses, and the entry into new lines of business.   

 In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses, or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.  

 From time to time, we may enter lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, including the investment of significant time and resources, the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable, and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. In addition, we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful.   

 We may face additional risks from the growth and development of companies that we acquire or new lines of business.   

 We face additional risks associated with companies that we acquire or new lines of business into which we enter, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop had significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

27 

 The process of integrating an acquired company may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.   

 Companies that we acquire often run on a technology platform different from those used in our businesses. When integrating these businesses, we face additional risks. These risks include implementing or remediating controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company, integration of the acquired company's accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions, transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms and the failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.  

 Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change-in-control agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. To retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we may offer additional retention incentives, but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees.  

 Risks relating primarily to our Risk Solutions segment   

 Results in our Risk Solutions segment may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.   

 Results in our Risk Solutions segment have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.  

 In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:   

the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to "self-insure," the use of so-called "captive" insurers, and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs;  

fluctuation in the need for insurance as the economic downturn continues, as clients either go out of business or scale back their operations, and thus reduce the amount of insurance, they procure;  

the level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;  

the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation;   

competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers without the involvement of an insurance broker;   

In addition, our increasing focus on new product offerings within the Risk Solutions space expose us to additional risks. For example, GRIP is a relatively new and historically untested offering; it may fail to  

28 

catch on within the insurance industry or conversely, if successful, may face increasing pressure from competitors who develop competing offerings. As our business, like the economy as a whole, becomes more technology focused, the speed at which our products are subject to challenge or becoming outdated is consistently increasing.   

 Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.   

 Since the Attorney General of New York brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community in 2004, there has been uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices, it is possible that those regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future. If they do so, compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business.  

 Risks relating primarily to our HR Solutions segment   

 We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Hewitt or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.   

 Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Hewitt depends, to a large extent, on our ability to fully integrate the legacy Hewitt businesses into the Company. The acquisition and integration of a company the size of Hewitt is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we have devoted and continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Hewitt's business practices and operations with ours. The integration process may disrupt the HR Solutions business and, if not implemented effectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully Hewitt's operations and our operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems, including, among others:   

managing a significantly larger company;  

maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;   

integrating two unique business cultures, which may prove to be incompatible;   

the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;   

retaining existing clients and attracting new clients;  

consolidating corporate information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;  

the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention to the acquisition;  

coordinating geographically separate organizations;  

unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;   

unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;  

managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company; and   

unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition.   

29 

 Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and cash flows and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if Hewitt's operations are integrated successfully with our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and cause a decrease in the price of our ordinary shares. As a result, we cannot assure you that the acquisition of Hewitt will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.   

 The profitability of our outsourcing and consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.   

 In our HR Solutions segment, our profitability is a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to change in our business, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs or improve our efficiency.  

 Most new outsourcing arrangements undergo an implementation process whereby our systems and processes are customized to match a client's plans and programs. The cost of this process is estimated by us and often partially funded by our clients. If our actual implementation expense exceeds our estimate or if the ongoing service cost is greater than anticipated, the client contract may be less profitable than expected.  

 Even though outsourcing clients typically sign long-term contracts, some of these contracts may be terminated at any time, with or without cause, by our client upon 90 to 360 days written notice. Our outsourcing clients are generally required to pay a termination fee; however, this amount may not be sufficient to offset the costs we incurred in connection with the implementation and system set-up or fully compensate us for the profit we would have received if the contract had not been cancelled. A client may choose to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress, such as the business or financial condition of the client or general economic conditions. When any of our engagements are terminated, we may not be able to eliminate associated ongoing costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the impact on profitability. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could have an adverse effect on our profit margin.  

 Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, cost of living adjustment provisions, the extent of ongoing clients' perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions. Our profitability in providing HR BPO services is largely based on our ability to drive cost efficiencies during the term of our contracts for such services. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer.

 We might not be able to achieve the cost savings required to sustain and increase our profit margins in our HR Solutions business.   

 We provide our outsourcing services over long terms for variable or fixed fees that generally are less than our clients' historical costs to provide for themselves the services we contract to deliver. Also, clients' demand for cost reductions may increase over the term of the agreement. As a result, we bear the risk of increases in the cost of delivering HR outsourcing services to our clients, and our margins associated with particular contracts will depend on our ability to control our costs of performance under those contracts and meet our service commitments cost-effectively. Over time, some of our operating expenses will increase as we invest in additional infrastructure and implement new technologies to maintain our competitive position and meet our client service commitments. We must anticipate and respond to the dynamics of our industry and business by using quality systems, process management, improved asset utilization and effective supplier management tools. We must do this while continuing to grow our business so that our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base. If we are not able to achieve this, our ability to sustain and increase profitability may be reduced.   

 Our accounting for our long-term outsourcing contracts requires using estimates and projections that may change over time. These changes may have a significant or adverse effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition.   

 Projecting contract profitability on the long-term outsourcing contracts in our HR Solutions business requires us to make assumptions and estimates of future contract results. All estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to change. In an effort to maintain appropriate estimates, we review each of our long-term outsourcing contracts, the related contract reserves and intangible assets on a regular basis. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may also evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles and other factors. Further, changes in assumptions, estimates or developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to long-term outsourcing contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results. Application of, and changes in, assumptions, estimates and policies may adversely affect our financial results.   

 In our investment consulting business, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may assert claims against us.   

 Our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary/agency capacity albeit without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance; third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses of some, or all, of the capital that has been invested. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control. Regardless of the cause, clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us, and these claims may be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary/agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions.

 We rely on third parties to provide services, and their failure to perform the service could do harm to our business.   

 As part of providing services to clients in our HR Solutions business, we rely on a number of third-party service providers and, in some cases, subcontractors. These third parties include, but are not limited to, plan trustees and payroll service providers responsible for transferring funds to employees or on behalf of employees, and providers of data and information, such as software vendors, health plan providers, investment managers and investment advisers, that we work with to provide information to clients' employees. Those third parties also include providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers employed by us in connection with our human resources business processing services delivered to our clients. Failure of third-party service providers to perform in a timely manner, particularly during periods of peak demand, could result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients and/or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business.   

 We rely heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure and the integrity of these systems in the delivery of human resources services for our HR Solutions clients, and our operational performance and revenue growth depends, in part, on the reliability and functionality of this infrastructure as a means of delivering human resources services.   

 The internet is a key mechanism for delivering our human resources services to our HR Solutions clients efficiently and cost effectively. Our clients may not be receptive to human resource services delivered over the internet due to concerns regarding transaction security, user privacy, the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons. Our clients' concerns may be heightened by the fact we use the internet to transmit extremely confidential information about our clients and their employees, such as compensation, medical information and other personally identifiable information. In order to maintain the level of security, service and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant investments in our online methods of delivering human resources services. In addition, websites and proprietary online services have experienced service interruptions and other delays occurring throughout their infrastructure. If we cannot use the internet effectively to deliver our services, our revenue growth and results of operation may be impaired.  

 We may lose client data as a result of major catastrophes and other similar problems that may materially adversely impact our operations. We have multiple processing centers around the world that use various commercial methods for disaster recovery capabilities. Our main data processing center is located near the Aon Hewitt headquarters in Lincolnshire, Illinois. In the event of a disaster, our business continuity may not be sufficient, and the data recovered may not be sufficient for the administration of our clients' human resources programs and processes.  

 Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares   

 Transfers of the Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in the Class A Ordinary Shares.   

 Stamp duty and/or SDRT are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 1.5 percent.  

 You are strongly encouraged to hold your Class A Ordinary Shares in book entry form through the facilities of Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of title in the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5 percent of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer  

32 

document stamped by HMRC) before the transfer can be registered in the books of Aon UK. If those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.  

 We have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.  

 Following the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) in HSBC Holdings plc, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation v HMRC 2012 UKFTT 163 (TC) and the announcement by HMRC that it will not seek to appeal the decision, HMRC is no longer enforcing the charge to SDRT on the issue of shares into either EU or non-EU depository receipt or clearance systems. It is possible that the UK government may change the law in relation to stamp duty and SDRT in response to this decision, and that this would have a material effect on the cost of dealing in our shares.   

 If the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.   

 The facilities of DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. We believe that prior to the merger approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Aon Corporation were held within the DTC system. The Class A Ordinary Shares of Aon plc are, at present, eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. In connection with the closing of the merger, we entered into arrangements with DTC whereby we agreed to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty and/or SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our Class A Ordinary Shares. In addition, we have obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and SDRT consequences of the reorganization, and SDRT has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of Class A Ordinary Shares with the initial depository. DTC will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the Class A Ordinary Shares. If DTC determines at any time that the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe the Class A Ordinary Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500 and trading in the Class A Ordinary Shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Class A Ordinary Shares.
