Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Executive Overview  

2017 versus 2016. We generated net earnings of $4.29 billion and diluted earnings per common share of $9.01 for 2017, a decrease of 42% and 45%, respectively, compared with $7.40 billion and $16.29 per share for 2016. Return on average common shareholders equity was 4.9% for 2017, compared with 9.4% for 2016. Book value per common share was $181.00 as of December 2017, 0.8% lower compared with December 2016.  

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded $4.40 billion of estimated income tax expense related to Tax Legislation. Excluding this expense, diluted earnings per common share were $19.76 and return on average common shareholders equity was 10.8% for 2017. See Results of Operations  Financial Overview below for further information about these non-GAAP measures, including the calculation of diluted earnings per common share and return on average common shareholders equity, excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation. See Results of Operations  Provision for Taxes below for further information about Tax Legislation.  

Net revenues were $32.07 billion for 2017, 5% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher net revenues in Investing & Lending and higher net revenues in both Investment Banking and Investment Management. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenues in Institutional Client Services, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC Client Execution).  

Operating expenses were $20.94 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, due to slightly higher non-compensation expenses and compensation and benefits expenses.  

We returned $7.90 billion of capital to common shareholders during 2017, including $6.72 billion of common share repurchases and $1.18 billion in common stock dividends. Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio as calculated in accordance with the Standardized approach and the Basel III Advanced approach, in each case reflecting the applicable transitional provisions, was 12.1% and 10.9%, respectively, as of December 2017. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.  

In 2017, we announced strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis on growing earnings and returns. To accomplish these initiatives, we will continue to make investments in our businesses, including in technology and talent, while exploring new opportunities. We estimate these initiatives could generate $5 billion of incremental net revenues and $2.5 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings in 2020. 

2016 versus 2015. We generated net earnings of $7.40 billion and diluted earnings per common share of $16.29 for 2016, an increase of 22% and 34%, respectively, compared with $6.08 billion and $12.14 per share for 2015. Return on average common shareholders equity was 9.4% for 2016, compared with 7.4% for 2015. Book value per common share was $182.47 as of December 2016, 6.7% higher compared with December 2015.  

Net revenues were $30.61 billion for 2016, 9% lower than 2015, due to significantly lower net revenues in Investing & Lending and lower net revenues in Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services and Investment Management. These results reflected the impact of a challenging operating environment during the first half of 2016, particularly during the first quarter, although the environment improved during the second half of the year.  

Operating expenses were $20.30 billion for 2016, 19% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower non-compensation expenses, primarily reflecting significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, as 2015 included provisions related to the settlement agreement with the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (RMBS Working Group), as well as lower market development expenses and professional fees, reflecting expense savings initiatives. Compensation and benefits expenses were also lower, reflecting a decrease in net revenues and the impact of expense savings initiatives.  

We returned $7.20 billion of capital to common shareholders during 2016, including $6.07 billion of common share repurchases and $1.13 billion in common stock dividends. Our CET1 ratio as calculated in accordance with the Standardized approach and the Basel III Advanced approach, in each case reflecting the applicable transitional provisions, was 14.5% and 13.1%, respectively, as of December 2016. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Business Environment  

Global  

During 2017, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth appeared to generally increase compared to 2016 in both advanced and emerging market economies. In advanced economies, real GDP growth was higher in the U.S., the Euro area and Japan, but decreased slightly in the U.K. In emerging markets, real GDP growth increased slightly in China and appeared to decrease in India. Real GDP appeared to grow in Russia and Brazil compared with contractions in 2016. Broadly, global macroeconomic data remained strong throughout 2017, and volatility in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets was low. Major elections were held in France, the U.K., Germany and China, but none of these events resulted in significant volatility across markets. Major central banks continued to gradually tighten their stance on monetary policy, as the U.S. Federal Reserve increased its target interest rate three times and began the process of balance sheet normalization. In investment banking, industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions transactions remained solid during 2017, although volumes declined compared with 2016. Industry-wide offerings in equity underwriting increased significantly compared with 2016, and industry-wide debt underwriting offerings remained strong, particularly in leveraged finance activity.  

United States  

In the U.S., real GDP increased by 2.3% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.5% in 2016, as growth in business fixed investment increased. Measures of consumer confidence were stronger on average compared with the prior year, and the unemployment rate declined to 4.1% as of December 2017. Housing starts, sales and prices increased compared with 2016, while measures of inflation were mixed. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its target rate for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of the March, June and December meetings to end the year at a target range of 1.25% to 1.50%. In September, the U.S. Federal Reserve formally announced the process of balance sheet normalization. Previously, the U.S. Federal Reserve reinvested all proceeds from the maturity of bonds on its balance sheet, but since October 2017, $6 billion of U.S. Treasury securities and $4 billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities matured each month without reinvestment of the proceeds. These monthly allowances are expected to rise gradually over time to peak levels of $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note decreased by 5 basis points during 2017 to 2.40%. The price of natural gas decreased by 21% compared to the end of 2016 to $2.95 per million British thermal units and the price of crude oil (WTI) increased by 12% to approximately $60 per barrel. In equity markets, the NASDAQ Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index increased by 28%, 25% and 19%, respectively, during 2017. 

Europe  

In the Euro area, real GDP increased by 2.5% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.7% in 2016. Net exports improved, while growth in consumer spending and fixed investment slowed slightly. Measures of inflation remained subdued, prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to announce an extension of its asset purchase program in the fourth quarter of 2017, although the pace of its monthly asset purchases decreased from 60 billion to 30 billion beginning in January 2018. The ECB maintained its main refinancing operations rate at 0.00% and its deposit rate at (0.40%). The Euro appreciated by 14% against the U.S. dollar. Yields on 10-year government bonds in the Euro area generally increased during the year. In equity markets, the DAX Index, CAC 40 Index and Euro Stoxx 50 Index increased by 13%, 9% and 6%, respectively, during 2017. During 2017, the process of negotiating an arrangement for the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. began, resulting in an agreement on certain issues in December as negotiations shifted to transitional arrangements. In the U.K., real GDP increased by 1.7% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.9% in 2016. Inflation increased materially in 2017 prompting the Bank of England to raise the official bank rate by 25 basis points in November. The British pound appreciated by 10% against the U.S. dollar during 2017. Yields on 10-year government bonds in the U.K. decreased slightly during the year and, in equity markets, the FTSE 100 Index increased by 8% during 2017.  

Asia  

In Japan, real GDP increased by 1.6% in 2017, compared with an increase of 0.9% in 2016. The Bank of Japan maintained its negative interest rate policy and continued to target a yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds of approximately 0%. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds was essentially unchanged, the U.S. dollar depreciated by 4% against the Japanese yen and the Nikkei 225 Index increased by 19% in 2017. In China, real GDP increased by 6.9% in 2017, compared with an increase of 6.7% in 2016. The Peoples Bank of China slightly tightened its stance on monetary policy in early 2017. Measures of inflation decreased and the U.S. dollar depreciated by 6% against the Chinese yuan. In equity markets, the Hang Seng Index and the Shanghai Composite Index increased by 36% and 7%, respectively, during 2017. In India, real GDP appeared to increase by 6.2% in 2017, compared with an increase of 7.9% in 2016, and the rate of inflation decreased compared with 2016. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 6% against the Indian rupee and the BSE Sensex Index increased by 28% during 2017.

Other Markets  

In Brazil, real GDP appeared to increase by 1.1% in 2017, compared with a contraction of 3.5% in 2016. The U.S. dollar appreciated by 2% against the Brazilian real and the Bovespa Index increased by 27%. In Russia, real GDP appeared to increase by 1.5% in 2017, compared with a contraction of 0.2% in 2016. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 6% against the Russian ruble and the MICEX Index decreased by 6% during 2017.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Fair Value  

Fair Value Hierarchy. Financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (i.e., inventory), as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, are included in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.  

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolios net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.  

The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. 

Instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. As of December 2017 and December 2016, level 3 financial assets represented 2.1% and 2.7%, respectively, of our total assets. See Notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:  

     

Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;  

     

Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and  

     

Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.  

Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.  

Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in control and support functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Price Verification. All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent control and support functions include:  

     

Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.  

     

External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.  

     

Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.  

     

Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.  

     

Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.  

     

Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.  

     

Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales.  

See Notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.  

Review of Net Revenues. Independent control and support functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified. 

Review of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk Management), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to being put into use. Models are evaluated and re-approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See Risk Management  Model Risk Management for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.  

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets  

Goodwill. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.  

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factors are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated carrying value.  

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we assessed goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units by performing a qualitative assessment. The qualitative assessment required management to make judgments and to evaluate several factors, which included, but were not limited to, performance indicators, firm and industry events, macroeconomic indicators and fair value indicators. Based on our evaluation of these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. Therefore, we determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.  

See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our goodwill.  

Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and attributed equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated net book value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital for further information about our capital requirements.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets or our performance, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. In addition, significant changes to other inputs of the quantitative goodwill test could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.  

Identifiable Intangible Assets. We amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  

A prolonged or severe period of market weakness, or significant changes in regulation, could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets. In addition, certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets, including weaker business performance resulting in a decrease in our customer base and decreases in revenues from customer contracts and relationships. Management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required.  

An impairment, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the total of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.  

See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our identifiable intangible assets.  

Recent Accounting Developments  

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about Recent Accounting Developments. 

Use of Estimates  

U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining income tax expense related to Tax Legislation, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), the allowance for losses on loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment, and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits.  

We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings.  

Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.  

In accounting for income taxes, we recorded an estimated impact of Tax Legislation. We have made assumptions and judgments regarding interpretations of Tax Legislation. In addition, in accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.  

We also estimate and record an allowance for losses related to our loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment. Managements estimate of loan losses entails judgment about loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for losses on loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment.

Results of Operations  

The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.  

Financial Overview  

The table below presents an overview of our financial results and selected financial ratios.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

     

Dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by diluted earnings per common share.  

     

Net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2016 included a benefit of $266 million, reflected in preferred stock dividends, related to the exchange of APEX for shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  

     

Return on average common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders equity. Return on average total shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by average monthly total shareholders equity. The table below presents our average common and total shareholders equity.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

     

In 2017, we recorded $4.40 billion of estimated income tax expense related to Tax Legislation. Excluding this expense, diluted earnings per common share were $19.76 and return on average common shareholders equity was 10.8% for 2017. We believe that presenting our results excluding Tax Legislation is meaningful as excluding this item increases the comparability of period-to-period results. See Results of Operations  Provision for Taxes below for further information about Tax Legislation. Diluted earnings per common share and return on average common shareholders equity, excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation, are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The tables below present the calculation of net earnings applicable to common shareholders, diluted earnings per common share and average common shareholders equity, excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

     

In 2017, as required, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The impact of adoption was a reduction to our provision for taxes of $719 million for 2017, which increased diluted earnings per common share by approximately $1.75 and return on average common shareholders equity by approximately 1.0 percentage points. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about this ASU.  

     

In 2015, we recorded provisions of $3.37 billion related to the settlement agreement with the RMBS Working Group, which reduced diluted earnings per common share by $6.53 and return on average common shareholders equity by 3.8 percentage points for 2015. See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further information.

During 2017, generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of industry-wide underwriting activities, investment management performance and other principal transactions. However, low levels of volatility in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets continued to negatively affect our market-making activities, particularly in fixed income, currency and commodity products. The price of natural gas decreased significantly during 2017, while the price of oil increased compared with the end of 2016.  

If the trend of low volatility continues over the long term and market-making activity levels remain low, or if investment banking activity levels, asset prices or assets under supervision decline, net revenues would likely be negatively impacted. See Segment Operating Results below for further information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.  

The first half of 2016 included challenging trends in the operating environment for our business activities including concerns and uncertainties about global economic growth, central bank activity and the political uncertainty and economic implications surrounding the potential exit of the U.K. from the E.U. During the second half of 2016, the operating environment improved, as global equity markets steadily increased and investment grade and high-yield credit spreads tightened. These trends provided a more favorable backdrop for our business activities.  

2017 versus 2016  

Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $32.07 billion for 2017, 5% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, and higher investment banking revenues, investment management revenues and net interest income. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower market making revenues and lower commissions and fees.  

Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.37 billion for 2017, 18% higher than 2016. Revenues in financial advisory were higher compared with 2016, reflecting an increase in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions. Revenues in underwriting were significantly higher compared with 2016, due to significantly higher revenues in both debt underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide leveraged finance activity, and equity underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide secondary offerings.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.80 billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues.  

Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.05 billion for 2017, 5% lower than 2016, reflecting a decline in our listed cash equity volumes in the U.S. Market volumes in the U.S. also declined.  

Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.66 billion for 2017, 23% lower than 2016, due to significantly lower revenues in commodities, currencies, credit products, interest rate products and equity derivative products. These results were partially offset by significantly higher revenues in equity cash products and significantly improved results in mortgages.   

Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.26 billion for 2017, 64% higher than 2016, primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities, which were positively impacted by company-specific events and corporate performance. In addition, net gains from public equities were significantly higher, as global equity prices increased during the year.  

Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.93 billion for 2017, 13% higher than 2016, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements, higher interest income from loans receivable due to higher yields and an increase in total average loans receivable, an increase in total average financial instruments owned, and the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks. The increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities, an increase in total average long-term borrowings, and the impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and collateralized financings. See Statistical Disclosures  Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity for further information about our sources of net interest income. 

2016 versus 2015  

Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $30.61 billion for 2016, 9% lower than 2015, reflecting the impact of a challenging operating environment during the first half of 2016, particularly during the first quarter, although the environment improved during the second half of the year. The decrease in net revenues was primarily due to significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and lower investment banking revenues, net interest income and investment management revenues. In addition, commissions and fees were slightly lower. These results were partially offset by slightly higher market making revenues.  

Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.27 billion for 2016, 11% lower compared with a strong 2015. Revenues in financial advisory were lower compared with a strong 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide transactions. Revenues in underwriting were lower compared with a strong 2015, due to significantly lower revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide volumes. Revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher revenues from asset-backed activity and higher revenues from leveraged finance activity.  

Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.41 billion for 2016, 8% lower than 2015, primarily reflecting significantly lower incentive fees compared with a strong 2015. In addition, management and other fees were slightly lower, reflecting shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies, partially offset by the impact of higher average assets under supervision.  

Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.21 billion for 2016, 3% lower than 2015, reflecting lower listed cash equity volumes in Asia and Europe, consistent with market volumes in these regions.  

Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.93 billion for 2016, 4% higher than 2015, due to significantly higher revenues in interest rate products and credit products. These results were partially offset by significantly lower revenues in equity cash products and lower revenues in currencies, mortgages, equity derivative products and commodities.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.20 billion for 2016, 36% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower revenues from investments in equities, primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities, driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. In addition, revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower compared with 2015, reflecting significantly lower revenues related to relationship lending activities, due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges. Losses related to these hedges were $596 million in 2016, compared with gains of $329 million in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about economic hedges related to our relationship lending activities.  

Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.59 billion for 2016, 16% lower than 2015, reflecting an increase in interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities, interest-bearing deposits and collateralized financings, and increases in total average long-term borrowings and total average interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest income related to collateralized agreements, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and loans receivable, reflecting an increase in total average balances and the impact of higher interest rates. See Statistical Disclosures  Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity for further information about our sources of net interest income.  

Operating Expenses  

Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. In addition, see Use of Estimates for further information about expenses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings.  

In the context of the challenging environment, we completed an initiative during 2016 that identified areas where we can operate more efficiently, resulting in a reduction of approximately $900 million in annual run rate compensation. For 2016, net savings from this initiative, after severance and other related costs, were approximately $500 million. 

The table below presents our operating expenses and total staff (including employees, consultants and temporary staff).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above, other expenses for 2015 included $3.37 billion recorded for the settlement agreement with the RMBS Working Group. See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further information.  

2017 versus 2016. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $20.94 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016. Compensation and benefits expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.85 billion for 2017, 2% higher than 2016. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2017 was 37.0% compared with 38.1% for 2016.  

Non-compensation expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.09 billion for 2017, 5% higher than 2016, primarily driven by our investments to fund growth. The increase compared with 2016 reflected higher expenses related to consolidated investments and our digital lending and deposit platform, Marcus: by Goldman Sachs (Marcus). These increases were primarily included in depreciation and amortization expenses, market development expenses and other expenses. In addition, technology expenses increased, reflecting higher expenses related to cloud-based services and software depreciation, and professional fees increased, primarily related to consulting costs. These increases were partially offset by lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and lower occupancy expenses (primarily related to exit costs in 2016).  

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2017 were $188 million compared with $396 million for 2016. 2017 included a $127 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised fund. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. We ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

As of December 2017, total staff increased 6% compared with December 2016, reflecting investments in technology and Marcus, and support of our regulatory efforts.  

2016 versus 2015. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $20.30 billion for 2016, 19% lower than 2015. Compensation and benefits expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.65 billion for 2016, 8% lower than 2015, reflecting a decrease in net revenues and the impact of expense savings initiatives. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2016 was 38.1% compared with 37.5% for 2015.  

Non-compensation expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.66 billion for 2016, 30% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses. In addition, market development expenses and professional fees were lower compared with 2015, reflecting expense savings initiatives. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2016 were $396 million compared with $4.01 billion for 2015 (2015 primarily related to net provisions for mortgage-related matters). 2016 included a $114 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. We ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.  

As of December 2016, total staff decreased 7% compared with December 2015, due to expense savings initiatives.  

Provision for Taxes  

The effective income tax rate for 2017 was 61.5%, up from 28.2% for 2016. The increase compared with 2016 reflected the estimated impact of Tax Legislation, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and, among other things, lowers U.S. corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018, implements a territorial tax system and imposes a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The estimated impact of Tax Legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $4.40 billion, of which $3.32 billion was due to the repatriation tax and $1.08 billion was due to the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates.  

The impact of Tax Legislation may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, (i) refinement of our calculations based on updated information, (ii) changes in interpretations and assumptions, (iii) guidance that may be issued and (iv) actions we may take as a result of Tax Legislation. 

Excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation, the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 22.0%, down from 28.2% for 2016. This decrease was primarily due to tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards in accordance with ASU No. 2016-09. The impact of these settlements in 2017 was a reduction to our provision for taxes of $719 million and a reduction in our effective income tax rate of 6.4 percentage points. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about this ASU.  

The effective income tax rate, excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation, is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that presenting our effective income tax rate, excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation is meaningful, as excluding this item increases the comparability of period-to-period results.  

The table below presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate, excluding the estimated impact of Tax Legislation.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 28.2%, down from 30.7% for 2015. The decline compared with 2015 was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters in 2015, partially offset by the impact of changes in tax law on deferred tax assets, the mix of earnings and an increase related to higher enacted tax rates impacting certain of our U.K. subsidiaries in 2016.  

Effective January 1, 2018, Tax Legislation reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent, eliminated tax deductions for certain expenses and enacted two new taxes, Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI). BEAT is an alternative minimum tax that applies to banks that pay more than 2 percent of total deductible expenses to certain foreign subsidiaries. GILTI is a 10.5 percent tax, before allowable credits for foreign taxes paid, on the annual earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. Based on our current understanding of these rules, the impact of BEAT and GILTI is not expected to be material to our effective income tax rate.

Segment Operating Results  

The table below presents the net revenues, operating expenses and pre-tax earnings of our segments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

     

Operating expenses included $3.37 billion recorded in Institutional Client Services in 2015 related to the settlement agreement with the RMBS Working Group. See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further information.  

     

All operating expenses have been allocated to our segments except for charitable contributions of $127 million for 2017, $114 million for 2016 and $148 million for 2015.  

Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and interest expense to specific securities, commodities and other positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such underlying positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments. 

Our cost drivers taken as a whole, compensation, headcount and levels of business activity, are broadly similar in each of our business segments. Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.  

Investment Banking  

Our Investment Banking segment consists of:  

Financial Advisory. Includes strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings, spin-offs, risk management and derivative transactions directly related to these client advisory assignments.  

Underwriting. Includes public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans, and derivative transactions directly related to these client underwriting activities.  

The table below presents the operating results of our Investment Banking segment.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

In the table above:   

     

Volumes are per Dealogic. Prior periods have been conformed to reflect volumes per Dealogic.  

     

Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related offerings and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction.  

     

Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings.  

     

Debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. Includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues. Excludes leveraged loans.   

Operating Environment. During 2017, industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions transactions remained solid, increasing slightly compared with 2016, although volumes declined compared with the prior year.  

In underwriting, generally higher equity prices and tighter credit spreads during 2017 continued to contribute to a relatively favorable financing environment. Industry-wide debt underwriting offerings remained strong, particularly in leveraged finance activity. Industry-wide equity underwriting offerings increased significantly during 2017 compared with the weak backdrop for new issuances during 2016.  

In the future, if industry-wide mergers and acquisitions transactions decline or volumes continue to decline, or if industry-wide activity levels in debt underwriting or equity underwriting decline, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted.  

During 2016, Investment Banking operated in an environment characterized by robust industry-wide mergers and acquisitions activity. Industry-wide equity underwriting volumes decreased significantly compared with strong levels in 2015, while industry-wide debt underwriting volumes increased compared with 2015.  

2017 versus 2016. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $7.37 billion for 2017, 18% higher than 2016. 

Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $3.19 billion, 9% higher than 2016, reflecting an increase in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions. Net revenues in Underwriting were $4.18 billion, 25% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher net revenues in both debt underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide leveraged finance activity, and equity underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide secondary offerings.  

Operating expenses were $3.53 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $3.85 billion in 2017, 36% higher than 2016.  

As of December 2017, our investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of 2016, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions and significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily in initial public offerings. These increases were partially offset by lower estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions, principally related to mergers and acquisitions.  

Our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time and others may enter and leave within the same reporting period. In addition, our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.  

2016 versus 2015. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $6.27 billion for 2016, 11% lower compared with a strong 2015.  

Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $2.93 billion, 16% lower compared with a strong 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide transactions. Net revenues in Underwriting were $3.34 billion, 6% lower compared with a strong 2015, due to significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide volumes. Net revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from asset-backed activity and higher net revenues from leveraged finance activity.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Operating expenses were $3.44 billion for 2016, 7% lower than 2015, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $2.84 billion in 2016, 14% lower than 2015.  

As of December 2016, our investment banking transaction backlog was lower compared with a strong level of backlog at the end of 2015, primarily due to lower estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and significantly lower estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions, principally reflecting decreases in mergers and acquisitions activity and acquisition-related financing, respectively. Estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions were slightly lower compared with the end of 2015.  

Institutional Client Services  

Our Institutional Client Services segment consists of:  

Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution. Includes client execution activities related to making markets in both cash and derivative instruments for interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities.  

     

Interest Rate Products. Government bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, repurchase agreements, and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.  

     

Credit Products. Investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds, bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.  

     

Mortgages. Commercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.  

     

Currencies. Currency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on G-10 currencies and emerging-market products.  

     

Commodities. Commodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products. 

Equities. Includes client execution activities related to making markets in equity products and commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. Equities also includes our securities services business, which provides financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees.  

Market-Making Activities  

As a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain inventory, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. We also hold inventory to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities. Our market-making inventory is recorded in financial instruments owned (long positions) or financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (short positions) in our consolidated statements of financial condition.  

Our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.  

The amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

In general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) wider credit spreads on our inventory positions.  

The table below presents the operating results of our Institutional Client Services segment.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents net revenues of our Institutional Client Services segment by line item in the consolidated statements of earnings. See Net Revenues above for further information about market making revenues, commissions and fees, and net interest income.

The primary driver of net revenues for FICC Client Execution, for the periods in the table above, was client activity.  

Operating Environment. Low volatility levels in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets were a consistent theme during 2017, impacting the operating environment for Institutional Client Services throughout the year. During 2017, average VIX declined to 11.10 compared with 15.84 in 2016, U.S. and European interest rates experienced historically low volatility levels, and volatility in G-10 currencies were near 10-year lows. This continued to negatively affect client activity across businesses, particularly in FICC Client Execution for 2017.  

Although market-making conditions remained challenging, including the price of natural gas decreasing by 21% compared to the end of 2016 to $2.95 per million British thermal units, there were some positives in the financial markets. Global equity markets continued to increase, with the MSCI World Index up 22% during 2017, and credit spreads continued to generally tighten in 2017. In addition, the price of oil increased by 12% compared to the end of 2016 to approximately $60 per barrel (WTI).  

If the trend of low volatility continues over the long term and activity levels remain low, net revenues in Institutional Client Services would likely continue to be negatively impacted. See Business Environment above for further information about economic and market conditions in the global operating environment during the year.  

The first half of 2016 included challenging trends in the operating environment for Institutional Client Services including concerns and uncertainties about global economic growth, central bank activity and the political uncertainty and economic implications surrounding the potential exit of the U.K. from the E.U. During the second half of 2016, the operating environment improved, as global equity markets steadily increased and investment grade and high-yield credit spreads tightened. These trends drove improved client sentiment and market-making conditions during the second half of 2016.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

2017 versus 2016. Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $11.90 billion for 2017, 18% lower than 2016.  

Net revenues in FICC Client Execution were $5.30 billion for 2017, 30% lower than 2016, reflecting significantly lower client activity. Approximately one-third of the decline in FICC Client Execution net revenues was due to significantly lower results in commodities.  

The following provides details of our FICC Client Execution net revenues by business, compared with 2016 results:  

     

Net revenues in commodities were significantly lower, reflecting the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.  

     

Net revenues in interest rate products were significantly lower, reflecting lower client activity.  

     

Net revenues in currencies were significantly lower, reflecting lower client activity and the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.  

     

Net revenues in credit products were significantly lower, reflecting lower client activity.  

     

Net revenues in mortgages were significantly higher, reflecting the impact of favorable market-making conditions on our inventory, including generally tighter spreads, compared with a challenging 2016.  

Net revenues in Equities were $6.60 billion, 4% lower than 2016, primarily due to lower commissions and fees, reflecting a decline in our listed cash equity volumes in the U.S. Market volumes in the U.S. also declined. In addition, net revenues in equities client execution were lower, reflecting lower net revenues in derivatives, partially offset by higher net revenues in cash products. Net revenues in securities services were essentially unchanged.  

Operating expenses were $9.69 billion for 2017, essentially unchanged compared with 2016, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues, largely offset by increased technology expenses, reflecting higher expenses related to cloud-based services and software depreciation, and increased consulting costs. Pre-tax earnings were $2.21 billion in 2017, 54% lower than 2016.  

2016 versus 2015. Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $14.47 billion for 2016, 5% lower than 2015.  

Net revenues in FICC Client Execution were $7.56 billion for 2016, 3% higher than 2015. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of changes in market- making conditions on our inventory. 

The following provides details of our FICC Client Execution net revenues by business, compared with 2015 results:  

     

Net revenues in credit products were significantly higher, reflecting improved market-making conditions, including generally tighter spreads, and higher client activity levels compared with low activity in 2015.  

     

Net revenues in interest rate products were higher, reflecting higher client activity levels.  

     

Net revenues in mortgages were significantly lower, reflecting less favorable market-making conditions, including generally wider spreads.  

     

Net revenues in currencies were lower, reflecting less favorable market-making conditions in emerging markets products compared with 2015, which included a strong first quarter of 2015.  

     

Net revenues in commodities were lower, reflecting significantly lower client activity.  

Net revenues in Equities were $6.91 billion, 12% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products, primarily in Asia, as well as lower net revenues in derivatives. Commissions and fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower listed cash equity volumes in Asia and Europe, consistent with market volumes in these regions, and net revenues in securities services were essentially unchanged compared with 2015.  

We elect the fair value option for certain unsecured borrowings. For 2015, the fair value net gain attributable to the impact of changes in our credit spreads on these borrowings was $255 million ($214 million and $41 million related to FICC Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively). For 2016, we adopted the requirement in ASU No. 2016-01 to present separately such gains and losses in other comprehensive income. The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for 2016 was a loss of $844 million ($544 million, net of tax). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU No. 2016-01.  

Operating expenses were $9.71 billion for 2016, 30% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, and decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $4.75 billion in 2016 compared with $1.21 billion in 2015.

Investing & Lending 

Investing & Lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans, including our relationship lending activities, to provide financing to clients. These investments and loans are typically longer-term in nature. We make investments, some of which are consolidated, including through our merchant banking business and our special situations group, in debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure and real estate entities. Some of these investments are made indirectly through funds that we manage. We also make unsecured and secured loans to retail clients through our digital platforms, Marcus and Goldman Sachs Private Bank Select (GS Select), respectively.  

The table below presents the operating results of our Investing & Lending segment.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Environment. During 2017, generally higher global equity prices and tighter credit spreads contributed to a favorable environment for our equity and debt investments. Results also reflected net gains from company-specific events, including sales, and corporate performance. This environment contrasts with 2016, where, in the first quarter of 2016, market conditions were difficult and corporate performance, particularly in the energy sector, was impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, market conditions improved during the rest of 2016 as macroeconomic concerns moderated. If macroeconomic concerns negatively affect company-specific events or corporate performance, or if global equity markets decline or credit spreads widen, net revenues in Investing & Lending would likely be negatively impacted. 

2017 versus 2016. Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $6.58 billion for 2017, 61% higher than 2016. Net revenues in equity securities were $4.58 billion, including $3.82 billion of net gains from private equities and $762 million in net gains from public equities. Net revenues in equity securities were 78% higher than 2016, primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities, which were positively impacted by company-specific events and corporate performance. In addition, net gains from public equities were significantly higher, as global equity prices increased during the year. Of the $4.58 billion of net revenues in equity securities, approximately 60% was driven by net gains from company-specific events, such as sales, and public equities. Net revenues in debt securities and loans were $2.00 billion, 33% higher than 2016, reflecting significantly higher net interest income (2017 included approximately $1.80 billion of net interest income). Net revenues in debt securities and loans for 2017 also included an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan.  

Operating expenses were $2.80 billion for 2017, 17% higher than 2016, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues, increased expenses related to consolidated investments, and increased expenses related to Marcus. Pre-tax earnings were $3.79 billion in 2017 compared with $1.69 billion in 2016.  

2016 versus 2015. Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $4.08 billion for 2016, 25% lower than 2015. Net revenues in equity securities were $2.57 billion, including $2.17 billion of net gains from private equities and $402 million in net gains from public equities. Net revenues in equity securities were 32% lower than 2015, primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities, driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. Net revenues in debt securities and loans were $1.51 billion, 9% lower than 2015, reflecting significantly lower net revenues related to relationship lending activities, due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges. Losses related to these hedges were $596 million in 2016, compared with gains of $329 million in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments and higher net interest income. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about economic hedges related to our relationship lending activities.  

Operating expenses were $2.39 billion for 2016, essentially unchanged compared with 2015. Pre-tax earnings were $1.69 billion in 2016, 44% lower than 2015.

Investment Management 

Investment Management provides investment management services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and individual clients. Investment Management also offers wealth advisory services provided by our subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P., including portfolio management and financial planning and counseling, and brokerage and other transaction services to high-net-worth individuals and families.  

Assets under supervision (AUS) include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. Assets under supervision also include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. Assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. Long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. Liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit assets.  

Assets under supervision typically generate fees as a percentage of net asset value, which vary by asset class and distribution channel and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and redemptions. Asset classes such as alternative investment and equity assets typically generate higher fees relative to fixed income and liquidity product assets. The average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based fees) we earned on our assets under supervision was 35 basis points for both 2017 and 2016, and 39 basis points for 2015.  

In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds or a separately managed accounts return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The table below presents our average monthly assets under supervision by asset class.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Environment. During 2017, Investment Management operated in an environment characterized by generally higher asset prices, resulting in appreciation in both equity and fixed income assets. In addition, our long-term assets under supervision increased from net inflows primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets. These increases were partially offset by net outflows in liquidity products. As a result, the mix of average assets under supervision during 2017 shifted slightly from liquidity products to long-term assets under supervision as compared to the mix at the end of 2016. In the future, if asset prices decline, or investors favor assets that typically generate lower fees or investors withdraw their assets, net revenues in Investment Management would likely be negatively impacted.  

Following a challenging first quarter of 2016, market conditions improved during the remainder of 2016 with higher asset prices resulting in full year appreciation in both equity and fixed income assets. Also, our assets under supervision increased during 2016 from net inflows, primarily in fixed income assets, and liquidity products. The mix of our average assets under supervision shifted slightly compared with 2015 from long-term assets under supervision to liquidity products. Management fees were impacted by many factors, including inflows to advisory services and outflows from actively-managed mutual funds. 

2017 versus 2016. Net revenues in Investment Management were $6.22 billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues. During the year, total assets under supervision increased $115 billion to $1.49 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $128 billion, including net market appreciation of $86 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, and net inflows of $42 billion (which includes $20 billion of inflows in connection with the Verus acquisition and $5 billion of equity asset outflows in connection with the Australian divestiture), primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets. Liquidity products decreased $13 billion (which includes $3 billion of inflows in connection with the Verus acquisition).  

Operating expenses were $4.80 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $1.42 billion in 2017, 25% higher than 2016.  

2016 versus 2015. Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.79 billion for 2016, 7% lower than 2015. This decrease primarily reflected significantly lower incentive fees compared with a strong 2015. In addition, management and other fees were slightly lower, reflecting shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies, partially offset by the impact of higher average assets under supervision. During 2016, total assets under supervision increased $127 billion to $1.38 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $75 billion, including net inflows of $42 billion, primarily in fixed income assets, and net market appreciation of $33 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets. In addition, liquidity products increased $52 billion.  

Operating expenses were $4.65 billion for 2016, 4% lower than 2015, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $1.13 billion in 2016, 17% lower than 2015.

Balance Sheet and Funding Sources  

Balance Sheet Management 

One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of equity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  Equity Capital Management for information about our equity capital management process.  

Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.  

In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.  

Balance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:  

     

To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;  

     

To allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and equity capital levels, and key metrics; and  

     

To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.  

Business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions along with business managers review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. 

Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections, and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Finance Committee. See Risk Management  Overview and Structure of Risk Management for an overview of our risk management structure.  

Balance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Finance Committee has the responsibility of reviewing and approving balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among business managers and managers in our independent control and support functions on a routine basis. The Firmwide Finance Committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits on a quarterly basis and may also approve changes in limits on a more frequent basis in response to changing business needs or market conditions. In addition, the Risk Governance Committee sets aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored on a daily basis by business risk managers, as well as managers in our independent control and support functions.  

Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.  

Scenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  Equity Capital Management below for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short-term and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.

Balance Sheet Allocation 

In addition to preparing our consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we prepare a balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses, which is a non-GAAP presentation and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP presentations used by other companies. We believe that presenting our assets on this basis is meaningful because it is consistent with the way management views and manages risks associated with our assets and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of our assets.  

The table below presents our balance sheet allocation.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2017, we aggregated global core liquid assets (GCLA) and other with cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity (previously included in secured client financing). Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.  

The following is a description of the captions in the table above:  

     

GCLA, Segregated Assets and Other. We maintain liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. See Risk Management  Liquidity Risk Management below for details on the composition and sizing of our GCLA. We also segregate cash and securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Securities are segregated from our own inventory, as well as from collateral obtained through securities borrowed or resale agreements. In addition, we maintain other unrestricted operating cash balances, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. 

     

Secured Client Financing. We provide collateralized financing for client positions, including margin loans secured by client collateral, securities borrowed, and resale agreements primarily collateralized by government obligations. Our secured client financing arrangements, which are generally short-term, are accounted for at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value, and include daily margin requirements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.  

     

Institutional Client Services. In Institutional Client Services, we maintain inventory positions to facilitate market making in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. Additionally, as part of market-making activities, we enter into resale or securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities or use our own inventory to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. The receivables in Institutional Client Services primarily relate to securities transactions.  

     

Investing & Lending. In Investing & Lending, we make investments and originate loans to provide financing to clients. We also make unsecured and secured loans to retail clients. These investments and loans are typically longer-term in nature. In addition, we make investments, directly and indirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities, loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure, real estate entities and other investments. As of December 2017, total equity included $2.07 billion of private equity securities that were acquired during 2017. The regional composition of total equity was approximately 54% and 55% in the Americas, 18% and 18% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 28% and 27% in Asia as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. Other Investing & Lending primarily includes receivables from customers and counterparties.  

The table below presents details about loans.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loans receivable consists of loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans receivable.

Other Assets. Other assets are generally less liquid, nonfinancial assets, including property, leasehold improvements and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, income tax-related receivables and miscellaneous receivables.  

The table below presents the reconciliation of this balance sheet allocation to our U.S. GAAP balance sheet.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

     

Total assets for Institutional Client Services and Investing & Lending represent inventory and related assets. These amounts differ from total assets by business segment disclosed in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements because total assets disclosed in Note 25 include allocations of our GCLA, segregated assets and other, secured client financing and other assets.  

     

See Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics for explanations on the changes in our balance sheet from December 2016 to December 2017. 

Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics  

As of December 2017, total assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $916.78 billion, an increase of $56.61 billion from December 2016, primarily reflecting increases in financial instruments owned of $20.04 billion, loans receivable of $16.26 billion and receivables from customers and counterparties of $12.33 billion. The increase in financial instruments owned primarily reflected higher client activity and an increase in available-for-sale securities in U.S. government and agency obligations and corporate loans and debt securities, partially offset by the impact of currency movements on derivative valuations. The increase in loans receivable primarily reflected an increase in loans to corporate borrowers and loans backed by real estate. The increase in receivables from customers and counterparties reflected client activity.  

As of December 2017, total liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $834.53 billion, an increase of $61.26 billion from December 2016, primarily reflecting increases in unsecured long-term borrowings of $28.60 billion, collateralized financings of $23.44 billion and deposits of $14.51 billion, partially offset by a decrease in payables to customers and counterparties of $12.57 billion. The increase in unsecured long-term borrowings was primarily due to net new issuances. The increase in collateralized financings reflected the impact of client and firm activity. The increase in deposits reflected increases in institutional deposits and Marcus deposits. The decrease in payables to customers and counterparties reflected client activity.  

As of December 2017 and December 2016, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $84.72 billion and $71.82 billion, respectively, which were 2% lower and 5% lower than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarters ended December 2017 and December 2016, respectively, and 1% lower and 9% lower than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the years ended December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily averages during 2017 and 2016 resulted from the impact of firm and client activity at the end of both years.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Funding Sources  

Our primary sources of funding are secured financings, unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings, and deposits. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations.  

We raise funding through a number of different products, including:  

     

Collateralized financings, such as repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings;  

     

Long-term unsecured debt (including structured notes) through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings;  

     

Savings, demand and time deposits through internal and third-party broker-dealers, as well as from retail and institutional clients; and  

     

Short-term unsecured debt at the subsidiary level through U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and other methods.  

Our funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Secured Funding. We fund a significant amount of inventory on a secured basis, including repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. As of December 2017 and December 2016, secured funding included in collateralized financings in the consolidated statements of financial condition was $124.30 billion and $100.86 billion, respectively. We may also pledge our inventory as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement or as collateral for derivative transactions. We also use our own inventory to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we continually analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding, and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA.  

We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.  

The weighted average maturity of our secured funding included in collateralized financings in the consolidated statements of financial condition, excluding funding that was collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, exceeded 120 days as of December 2017.  

Assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. Assets that are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis. See Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings below for further information about the use of unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding. 

We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 2017 and December 2016, our outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank were $3.40 billion and $2.43 billion, respectively.  

GS Bank USA also has access to funding through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. While we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing, we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and test discount window borrowing procedures.  

Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings. We issue unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding for inventory and other assets and to finance a portion of our GCLA. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.  

The table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile as of December 2017.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2017 was approximately eight years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.  

Deposits. Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. A growing source of our deposit base consists of retail deposits. Deposits are primarily used to finance lending activity, other inventory and a portion of our GCLA. We raise deposits primarily through GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). As of December 2017 and December 2016, our deposits were $138.60 billion and $124.10 billion, respectively.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings. A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including hybrid financial instruments, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In light of regulatory developments, Group Inc. no longer issues debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries.  

As of December 2017 and December 2016, our unsecured short-term borrowings, including the current portion of unsecured long-term borrowings, were $46.92 billion and $39.27 billion, respectively. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.  

Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  

Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions.  

Equity Capital Management  

We determine the appropriate level and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors including our current and future consolidated regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the consolidated and business levels.  

We principally manage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to any repurchases, we must receive confirmation that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB) does not object to such capital action. See Notes 16 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.  

The following is a description of our capital planning and stress testing process:  

     

Capital Planning. Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.  

Our capital planning process also includes an internal risk-based capital assessment. This assessment incorporates market risk, credit risk and operational risk. Market risk is calculated by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations supplemented by risk-based add-ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks). Credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties probability of default and the size of our losses in the event of a default. Operational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures, as well as considering internal and external actual loss experience. Backtesting for market risk and credit risk is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks.  

     

Stress Testing. Our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required under CCAR and DFAST, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in Business  Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  

As required by the FRBs annual CCAR rules, we submit a capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRBs review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and stress scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across a range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions.  

In addition, the DFAST rules require us to conduct stress tests on a semi-annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. The FRB also conducts its own annual stress tests and publishes a summary of certain results.  

With respect to our 2017 CCAR submission, the FRB informed us that it did not object to our capital actions. These capital actions included the potential to repurchase outstanding common stock of up to $8.70 billion, and the potential to issue and redeem other capital securities over the twelve-month period beginning July 2017, and the potential to increase our common stock dividend by up to $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2018. However, we do not expect that we will utilize our entire share repurchase authorization by June 2018. The amount and timing of our capital actions will be based on, among other things, our current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities. We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2017. See Business  Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  

In October 2017, we submitted our semi-annual DFAST results to the FRB and published a summary of the results of our internally developed severely adverse scenario. See Business  Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  

We are required to submit our 2018 CCAR results to the FRB by April 5, 2018.  

In addition, the rules adopted by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act require GS Bank USA to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. GS Bank USA submitted its 2017 annual DFAST results to the FRB in April 2017 and published a summary of its annual DFAST results in June 2017. See Business  Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 

Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSIB also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the Prudential Regulation Authoritys (PRA) Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.  

Contingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.  

Capital Attribution. We assess each of our businesses capital usage based upon our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of all of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our binding capital constraints. We also attribute risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to our business segments. As of December 2017, approximately 60% and 55% of RWAs calculated in accordance with the Standardized Capital Rules and the Basel III Advanced Rules, respectively, subject to transitional provisions, were attributed to our Institutional Client Services segment and substantially all of the remaining RWAs were attributed to our Investing & Lending segment. We manage the levels of our capital usage based upon balance sheet and risk limits, as well as capital return analyses of our businesses based on our capital attribution.  

Share Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

As of December 2017, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 47.6 million shares; however, we are only permitted to make repurchases to the extent that such repurchases have not been objected to by the FRB. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.  

Resolution Capital Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning (RCAP) framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.  

In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework which is designed to provide the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.  

Rating Agency Guidelines  

The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA and GSIB have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long-term and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. 

The level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See Risk Management  Liquidity Risk Management  Credit Ratings for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GS&Co. and GSI.  

Consolidated Regulatory Capital  

We are subject to the FRBs risk-based capital and leverage regulations, subject to certain transitional provisions (Capital Framework). These regulations are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, we are an Advanced approach banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).  

We calculate our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with (i) the Standardized approach and market risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Standardized Capital Rules) and (ii) the Advanced approach and market risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Basel III Advanced Rules) as described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.  

The lower of each capital ratio calculated in (i) and (ii) is the ratio against which our compliance with minimum ratio requirements is assessed. Each of the capital ratios calculated in accordance with the Basel III Advanced Rules was lower than that calculated in accordance with the Standardized Capital Rules and therefore the Basel III Advanced ratios were the ratios that applied to us as of both December 2017 and December 2016.  

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios as of both December 2017 and December 2016, and for further information about the Capital Framework.

Minimum Capital Ratios and Capital Buffers  

The table below presents our minimum required ratios.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

     

Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average adjusted total assets (which includes adjustments for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, and certain investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions).  

The minimum capital ratios applicable to us as of January 2019 will reflect the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, the countercyclical capital buffer, if any, determined by the FRB and the fully phased-in G-SIB buffer. The G-SIB buffer applicable to us as of January 2019 is 2.5% based on financial data as of or for the year ended December 2017. The G-SIB and countercyclical buffers in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes.  

Our minimum required supplementary leverage ratio is 5.0% as of January 1, 2018. See Supplementary Leverage Ratio below for further information.  

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our capital buffers. 

Fully Phased-in Capital Ratios  

The table below presents our capital ratios calculated in accordance with the Standardized Capital Rules and the Basel III Advanced Rules on a fully phased-in basis.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Although the deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital in the table above were not fully phased-in until January 2018, we believe that the fully phased-in capital ratios are meaningful because they are measures that we, our regulators and investors use to assess our ability to meet future regulatory capital requirements. These fully phased-in capital ratios are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

In the table above:  

     

Deduction for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, included goodwill of $3.67 billion as of both December 2017 and December 2016, and identifiable intangible assets of $373 million and $429 million as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively, net of associated deferred tax liabilities of $704 million and $1.08 billion as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively.  

     

Deduction for investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions represents the amount by which our investments in the capital of nonconsolidated financial institutions exceed certain prescribed thresholds. The decrease from December 2016 to December 2017 primarily reflects reductions in our fund investments.  

     

Deduction for investments in covered funds represents our aggregate investments in applicable covered funds, excluding investments that are subject to an extended conformance period. This deduction was not subject to a transition period. See Business  Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about the Volcker Rule. 

     

Other adjustments within CET1 primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities, debt valuation adjustments and other required credit risk-based deductions.  

     

Qualifying subordinated debt is subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. with an original maturity of five years or greater. The outstanding amount of subordinated debt qualifying for Tier 2 capital is reduced upon reaching a remaining maturity of five years. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our subordinated debt.  

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our transitional capital ratios, which represent the ratios that are applicable to us as of both December 2017 and December 2016. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio  

The Capital Framework includes a supplementary leverage ratio requirement for Advanced approach banking organizations. Under amendments to the Capital Framework, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule that implements the supplementary leverage ratio aligned with the definition of leverage established by the Basel Committee. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, which consists of daily average total assets for the quarter and certain off-balance-sheet exposures, less certain balance sheet deductions. The Capital Framework requires a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 5.0% (consisting of the minimum requirement of 3.0% and a 2.0% buffer) for U.S. BHCs deemed to be G-SIBs, effective on January 1, 2018.  

The table below presents our supplementary leverage ratio, calculated on a fully phased-in basis.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above, the off-balance-sheet exposures consists of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees.  

Subsidiary Capital Requirements  

Many of our subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA and our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.  

GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated in substantially the same manner as those applicable to BHCs and calculates its capital ratios in accordance with the risk-based capital and leverage requirements applicable to state member banks, which are based on the Capital Framework. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the Capital Framework as it relates to GS Bank USA, including GS Bank USAs capital ratios and required minimum ratios.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

In addition, under FRB rules, commencing on January 1, 2018, in order to be considered a well-capitalized depository institution, GS Bank USA must have a supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0% or greater. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as daily average total assets for the quarter and certain off-balance-sheet exposures, less certain balance sheet deductions.  

The table below presents GS Bank USAs supplementary leverage ratio, calculated on a fully phased-in basis.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above, the off-balance-sheet exposures consists of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees.  

GSI. Our regulated U.K. broker-dealer, GSI, is one of our principal non-U.S. regulated subsidiaries and is regulated by the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority. GSI is subject to the capital framework for E.U.-regulated financial institutions prescribed in the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). These capital regulations are largely based on Basel III.  

The table below presents GSIs minimum required capital ratios.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The minimum capital ratios in the table above incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future. GSIs future capital requirements may also be impacted by developments such as the introduction of capital buffers as described above in Minimum Capital Ratios and Capital Buffers.  

As of December 2017, GSI had a CET1 ratio of 11.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.6% and a Total capital ratio of 16.0%. Each of these ratios included approximately 67 basis points attributable to amounts which will be finalized upon the issuance of GSIs 2017 annual audited financial statements. As of December 2016, GSI had a CET1 ratio of 12.9%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.9% and a Total capital ratio of 17.2%. 

In November 2016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR to implement a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions. This leverage ratio compares the CRRs definition of Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees), less Tier 1 capital deductions. Any required minimum leverage ratio is expected to become effective for GSI no earlier than January 1, 2021. As of December 2017 and December 2016, GSI had a leverage ratio of 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The ratio as of December 2017 included approximately 20 basis points attributable to amounts which will be finalized upon the issuance of GSIs 2017 annual audited financial statements. This leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with GSIs regulators.  

Other Subsidiaries. The capital requirements of several of our subsidiaries may increase in the future due to the various developments arising from the Basel Committee, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other governmental entities and regulators. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the capital requirements of our other regulated subsidiaries.  

Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. In certain instances, Group Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. As of December 2017 and December 2016, Group Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was $93.88 billion and $92.77 billion, respectively, compared with its total shareholders equity of $82.24 billion and $86.89 billion, respectively.  

Our capital invested in non-U.S. subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non-U.S. denominated debt. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our net investment hedges, which are used to hedge this risk.  

Guarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

Regulatory Matters and Developments  

Our businesses are subject to significant and evolving regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate. In addition, other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. See Business  Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations. In addition, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about regulatory developments as they relate to our regulatory capital and leverage ratios.  

Resolution and Recovery Plans  

We are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). We are also required by the FRB to submit a periodic recovery plan that outlines the steps that management could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress.  

In December 2017, the FRB and the FDIC provided feedback on our 2017 resolution plan and determined that it satisfactorily addressed the shortcomings identified in our prior submissions. The FRB and the FDIC did not identify deficiencies in our 2017 resolution plan, but the FRB and the FDIC did note one shortcoming that must be addressed in our next resolution plan submission. The FRB and the FDIC have extended the next resolution plan filing deadline by one year to July 1, 2019. See Business  Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  

As part of our resolution planning efforts, we put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and our major subsidiaries. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about the CLSA. Additionally, as part of our preferred resolution strategy, we have established RCAP, Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning (RLAP), Resolution Liquidity Execution Need (RLEN), and triggers and alerts frameworks. See Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  Equity Capital Management for further information about RCAP, and triggers and alerts frameworks, and see Liquidity Risk Management  Liquidity Stress Tests for further information about RLAP, RLEN, and triggers and alerts frameworks.  

In addition, GS Bank USA is required to submit periodic resolution plans to the FDIC. GS Bank USAs next resolution plan is due on July 1, 2018. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements  

We have various types of off-balance-sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:  

     

Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;  

     

Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;  

     

Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps;  

     

Entering into operating leases; and  

     

Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.  

We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.  

We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.  

Our financial interests in, and derivative transactions with, such nonconsolidated entities are generally accounted for at fair value, in the same manner as our other financial instruments, except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Contractual Obligations  

We have certain contractual obligations which require us to make future cash payments. These contractual obligations include our time deposits, secured long-term financings, unsecured long-term borrowings, contractual interest payments, subordinated liabilities of consolidated VIEs and minimum rental payments under noncancelable leases.  

Our obligations to make future cash payments also include our commitments and guarantees related to off-balance-sheet arrangements, which are excluded from the table below. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about such commitments and guarantees.  

Due to the uncertainty of the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the table below. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unrecognized tax benefits.  

The table below presents our contractual obligations by type.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents our contractual obligations by period of expiration.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

     

Obligations maturing within one year of our financial statement date or redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holders are excluded as they are treated as short-term obligations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our short-term borrowings.  

     

Obligations that are repayable prior to maturity at our option are reflected at their contractual maturity dates and obligations that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holders are reflected at the earliest dates such options become exercisable.  

     

As of December 2017, unsecured long-term borrowings had maturities extending to 2057, consisted principally of senior borrowings, and included $5.61 billion of adjustments to the carrying value of certain unsecured long-term borrowings resulting from the application of hedge accounting. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.  

     

As of December 2017, the difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings for which the fair value option was elected was not material.  

     

As of December 2017, the aggregate contractual principal amount of unsecured long-term borrowings for which the fair value option was elected exceeded the related fair value by $1.69 billion.  

     

Contractual interest payments represents estimated future interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings, secured long-term financings and time deposits based on applicable interest rates as of December 2017, and includes stated coupons, if any, on structured notes.  

     

Future minimum rental payments are net of minimum sublease rentals under noncancelable leases. These lease commitments for office space expire on various dates through 2069. Certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our leases.

Risk Management  

Risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. For further information about our risk management processes, see Overview and Structure of Risk Management below. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our areas of risk, see Liquidity Risk Management, Market Risk Management, Credit Risk Management, Operational Risk Management and Model Risk Management below and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  

Overview and Structure of Risk Management  

Overview  

We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to our success. Accordingly, we have established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. These risks include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risk exposures. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.  

Governance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the ERM framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our strategic business objectives, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. 

The Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk from our independent control and support functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from the head of Compliance, on legal and regulatory matters from the general counsel, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. The chief risk officer, as part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.  

Next, at our most senior levels, our leaders are experienced risk managers, with a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the risks we take. Our senior management, and senior managers in our revenue-producing units and independent control and support functions, lead and participate in risk-oriented committees. Independent control and support functions include Compliance, the Conflicts Resolution Group (Conflicts), Controllers, Credit Risk Management, Human Capital Management, Legal, Liquidity Risk Management and Analysis (Liquidity Risk Management), Market Risk Management and Analysis (Market Risk Management), Model Risk Management, Operations, Operational Risk Management and Analysis (Operational Risk Management), Tax, Technology and Treasury.  

Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk-related committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to identify, manage and mitigate risks.  

We maintain strong communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among the revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management. While our revenue-producing units are responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to independent control and support functions in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.

Processes. We maintain various processes and procedures that are critical components of our risk management framework, including identifying, assessing, monitoring and limiting our risks.  

To effectively assess and monitor our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.  

We also apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly, through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds, included in our risk appetite statement, at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, at a variety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis. The Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Committee) is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. See Liquidity Risk Management, Market Risk Management and Credit Risk Management for further information about our risk limits.  

Active management of our positions is another important process. Proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress.  

Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems are comprehensive, reliable and timely. We devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete, accurate and timely information.  

People. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. In both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions, the experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guide us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.   

We reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite statement, in our training and development programs, as well as the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our annual performance review process, we assess reputational excellence including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.  

Structure  

Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk-oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation.  

Membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.

Conflicts Management  

Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term conflict of interest does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by the entire firm.  

We have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution, and, in conjunction with Conflicts, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.  

As a general matter, Conflicts reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. Conflicts reports to one of our presidents and co-chief operating officers.  

We regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Liquidity Risk Management  

Overview  

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund the firm or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry, or market liquidity stress events. Liquidity is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.  

Treasury has the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity and funding strategy. Treasury is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our chief financial officer.  

Liquidity Risk Management is an independent risk management function responsible for control and oversight of our liquidity risk management framework, including stress testing and limit governance. Liquidity Risk Management is independent of the revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer.  

Liquidity Risk Management Principles  

We manage liquidity risk according to three principles (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan.  

Global Core Liquid Assets. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. Our most important liquidity policy is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.  

Our GCLA reflects the following principles:  

     

The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a companys survival; 

     

Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;  

     

During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and  

     

As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.  

We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Funding IHC and Group Inc.s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types, and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.  

We believe that our GCLA provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment.  

Asset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.  

Our approach to asset-liability management includes:  

     

Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See Balance Sheet and Funding Sources  Funding Sources for further details; 

 82   Goldman Sachs 2017 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

     

Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and our ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See Balance Sheet and Funding Sources  Balance Sheet Management for further details on our balance sheet management process and  Funding Sources  Secured Funding for further details on asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and  

     

Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.  

Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Finance Committee on a quarterly basis. In addition, senior managers in our independent control and support functions regularly analyze, and the Firmwide Finance Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.  

Subsidiary Funding Policies  

The majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which lends the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. 

Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiarys funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.  

Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2017, Group Inc. had $29.60 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $37.19 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.69 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $27.56 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $3.86 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $114.98 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $50.59 billion), and $13.38 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities, substantially all of which was to GS&Co., GSI, GSJCL and GS Bank USA, as of December 2017. In addition, as of December 2017, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.  

Contingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. 

 Goldman Sachs 2017 Form 10-K   83  

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals to foster effective coordination, control and distribution of information, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. The contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of these groups and individuals, which include making and disseminating key decisions, coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication.  

Liquidity Stress Tests  

In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we use an internal liquidity model, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, which captures and quantifies our liquidity risks. We also consider other factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis.  

Modeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:  

     

Severely challenged market environments, including low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and  

     

A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive departure, and/or a ratings downgrade.  

The following are the critical modeling parameters of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow:  

     

Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;  

     

A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;  

     

A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows (e.g., actions though not contractually required, we may deem necessary in a crisis). We assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis; 

     

No issuance of equity or unsecured debt;  

     

No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and  

     

No asset liquidation, other than the GCLA.  

The potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows covered in our Modeled Liquidity Outflow include:  

Unsecured Funding  

     

Contractual: All upcoming maturities of unsecured long-term debt, commercial paper, and other unsecured funding products. We assume that we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt.  

     

Contingent: Repurchases of our outstanding long-term debt, commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as a market maker.  

Deposits  

     

Contractual: All upcoming maturities of term deposits. We assume that we will be unable to raise new term deposits or rollover any maturing term deposits.  

     

Contingent: Partial withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. The withdrawal assumptions reflect, among other factors, the type of deposit, whether the deposit is insured or uninsured, and our relationship with the depositor.  

Secured Funding  

     

Contractual: A portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts (i.e., on terms which require us to post additional collateral). Our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the quality of the underlying collateral, counterparty roll probabilities (our assessment of the counterpartys likelihood of continuing to provide funding on a secured basis at the maturity of the trade) and counterparty concentration.  

     

Contingent: Adverse changes in the value of financial assets pledged as collateral for financing transactions, which would necessitate additional collateral postings under those transactions.  

OTC Derivatives  

     

Contingent: Collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our OTC derivatives, excluding those that are cleared and settled through central counterparties (OTC-cleared). 

 84   Goldman Sachs 2017 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

     

Contingent: Other outflows of cash or collateral related to OTC derivatives, excluding OTC-cleared, including the impact of trade terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral disputes, loss of rehypothecation rights, collateral calls or termination payments required by a two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings, and collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.  

Exchange-Traded and OTC-cleared Derivatives  

     

Contingent: Variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives.  

     

Contingent: An increase in initial margin and guaranty fund requirements by derivative clearing houses.  

Customer Cash and Securities  

     

Contingent: Liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business, including withdrawals of customer credit balances, and a reduction in customer short positions, which may serve as a funding source for long positions.  

Securities  

     

Contingent: Liquidity outflows associated with a reduction or composition change in our short positions, which may serve as a funding source for long positions.  

Unfunded Commitments  

     

Contingent: Draws on our unfunded commitments. Draw assumptions reflect, among other things, the type of commitment and counterparty.  

Other  

     

Other upcoming large cash outflows, such as tax payments.  

Intraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.  

The following are key modeling elements of the Intraday Liquidity Model:  

     

Liquidity needs over a one-day settlement period;  

     

Delays in receipt of counterparty cash payments;  

     

A reduction in the availability of intraday credit lines at our third-party clearing agents; and  

     

Higher settlement volumes due to an increase in activity. 

Long-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.  

We also perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc or product-specific basis in response to market developments.  

Resolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our RLAP framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our RLEN framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.  

In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.  

Model Review and Validation  

Treasury regularly refines our Modeled Liquidity Outflow, Intraday Liquidity Model and our other stress testing models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. Any changes, including model assumptions, are assessed and approved by Liquidity Risk Management.  

Model Risk Management is responsible for the independent review and validation of our liquidity models. See Model Risk Management for further information about the review and validation of these models.  

Limits  

We use liquidity limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. The purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in monitoring and controlling our overall liquidity profile.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The Risk Committee of the Board and the Firmwide Finance Committee approve liquidity risk limits at the firmwide level. Limits are reviewed frequently and amended, with required approvals, on a permanent and temporary basis, as appropriate, to reflect changing market or business conditions.  

Our liquidity risk limits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk Management. Treasury is responsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.

Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December 2017 and December 2016 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.  

The table below presents the average fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our GCLA.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents the average fair value of our GCLA by asset class.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the tables above:  

     

The U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table below presents the average GCLA of Group Inc. and Funding IHC, and Group Inc.s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a consolidated requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. During the second quarter of 2017, in connection with our resolution plan, Group Inc. transferred substantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.  

Other Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $158.41 billion and $142.33 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.

Liquidity Regulatory Framework  

As a BHC, we are subject to the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies LCR rule. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%.  

The table below presents information about our average daily LCR.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the overall market environment will impact our average LCR in the future.  

In addition, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule that calls for a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) for large U.S. banking organizations. The proposal would require banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The proposed rule includes quarterly disclosure of the ratio, as well as a description of the banking organizations stable funding sources. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not released the final rule. We expect that we will be compliant with the NSFR requirement by the effective date of the final rule.  

The following is information on our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:  

     

GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to minimum liquidity standards under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December 2017, GS Bank USAs LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies proposed NSFR requirement described above would also apply to GS Bank USA.  

     

GSI. The LCR rule issued by the U.K. regulatory authorities became effective in the U.K. on October 1, 2015, with a phase-in period whereby certain financial institutions, including GSI, were required to have an 80% minimum ratio initially, increasing to 90% on January 1, 2017 and 100% on January 1, 2018. GSIs average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2017 exceeded the minimum requirement. 

     

Other Subsidiaries. We monitor the local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committees framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.  

The implementation of these rules, and any amendments adopted by the applicable regulatory authorities, could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.  

Credit Ratings  

We rely on the short-term and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.  

The table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of Group Inc. by DBRS, Inc. (DBRS), Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), and Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P).

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of GS Bank USA, GSIB, GS&Co. and GSI, by Fitch, Moodys and S&P.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of:  

     

Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;  

     

The level and variability of our earnings;  

     

Our capital base;  

     

Our franchise, reputation and management;  

     

Our corporate governance; and  

     

The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution.  

Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. 

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings.  

Cash Flows  

As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.  

Year Ended December 2017. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $11.66 billion to $110.05 billion at the end of 2017. We used $17.74 billion in net cash for operating activities, reflecting a decrease in the net liability for receivables and payables due to client activity. We used $29.12 billion in net cash for investing activities, primarily to fund loans receivable to corporate borrowers and loans backed by real estate and investments in U.S. government and agency obligations accounted for as available-for-sale securities. We generated $35.20 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings and increases in institutional deposits and Marcus deposits, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.  

Year Ended December 2016. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $28.27 billion to $121.71 billion at the end of 2016. We generated $9.27 billion in net cash from investing activities, primarily from net cash acquired in business acquisitions. We generated $19.00 billion in net cash from financing activities and operating activities, primarily from increases in deposits and from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.  

Year Ended December 2015. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $18.41 billion to $93.44 billion at the end of 2015. We used $18.57 billion in net cash for investing activities, primarily due to funding of loans receivable. We generated $36.99 billion in net cash from financing activities and operating activities primarily from net issuances of long-term borrowings and bank deposits, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.

Market Risk Management  

Overview  

Market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, due to changes in market conditions. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. We hold inventory primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and lending activities. Our inventory therefore changes based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Our inventory is accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in market making and other principal transactions. Categories of market risk include the following:  

     

Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;  

     

Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;  

     

Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and  

     

Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.  

Market Risk Management, which is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk. We monitor and control risks through strong firmwide oversight and independent control and support functions across our global businesses.  

Managers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk Management discuss market information, positions and estimated risk and loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. 

Market Risk Management Process  

We manage our market risk by diversifying exposures, controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. This process includes:  

     

Accurate and timely exposure information incorporating multiple risk metrics;  

     

A dynamic limit setting framework; and  

     

Constant communication among revenue-producing units, risk managers and senior management.  

Risk Measures  

Market Risk Management produces risk measures and monitors them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.  

We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short-term and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions.  

Value-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures. We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model which captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.  

We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:  

     

VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme;  

     

VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and  

     

Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

When calculating VaR, we use historical simulations with full valuation of approximately 70,000 market factors. VaR is calculated at a position level based on simultaneously shocking the relevant market risk factors for that position. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.  

Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.  

Our VaR measure does not include:  

     

Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and  

     

The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.  

We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.  

Stress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and firmwide stress tests. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes.  

Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures. 

Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign inventory, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign inventory that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we typically consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.  

Firmwide stress testing combines market, credit, operational and liquidity risks into a single combined scenario. Firmwide stress tests are primarily used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process; however, firmwide stress testing is also integrated into our risk governance framework. This includes selecting appropriate scenarios to use for our capital planning and stress testing process. See Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  Equity Capital Management above for further information.  

Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur. Instead, stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).  

Stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. Stress testing is an important part of our risk management process because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions.  

Limits. We use risk limits at various levels (including firmwide, business and product) to govern our risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market risk. Limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. Limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or tolerance for risk.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The Risk Committee of the Board and the Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Committee) approve market risk limits and sub-limits at firmwide, business and product levels, consistent with our risk appetite statement. In addition, Market Risk Management (through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee) sets market risk limits and sub-limits at certain product and desk levels.  

The purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling our overall risk profile. Sub-limits are set below the approved level of risk limits. Sub-limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day-to-day basis without additional levels of senior management approval, effectively leaving day-to-day decisions to individual desk managers and traders. Accordingly, sub-limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance. Sub-limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand, taking into account the relative performance of each area.  

Our market risk limits are monitored daily by Market Risk Management, which is responsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.  

When a risk limit has been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations), it is escalated to senior managers in Market Risk Management and/or the appropriate risk committee. Such instances are remediated by an inventory reduction and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the risk limit.  

Model Review and Validation  

Our VaR and stress testing models are regularly reviewed by Market Risk Management and enhanced in order to incorporate changes in the composition of positions included in our market risk measures, as well as variations in market conditions. Prior to implementing significant changes to our assumptions and/or models, Model Risk Management performs model validations. Significant changes to our VaR and stress testing models are reviewed with our chief risk officer and chief financial officer, and approved by the Firmwide Risk Committee.  

See Model Risk Management for further information about the review and validation of these models. 

Systems  

We have made a significant investment in technology to monitor market risk including:  

     

An independent calculation of VaR and stress measures;  

     

Risk measures calculated at individual position levels;  

     

Attribution of risk measures to individual risk factors of each position;  

     

The ability to report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity); and  

     

The ability to produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.  

Metrics  

We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business, and region. The tables below present average daily VaR and period-end VaR, as well as the high and low VaR for the period. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.  

The table below presents average daily VaR by risk category.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our average daily VaR decreased to $54 million in 2017 from $63 million in 2016, due to reductions across all risk categories, partially offset by a decrease in the diversification effect. The overall decrease was primarily due to lower levels of volatility.  

Our average daily VaR decreased to $63 million in 2016 from $76 million in 2015, due to reductions across all risk categories, partially offset by a decrease in the diversification effect. The overall decrease was primarily due to reduced exposures.

The table below presents period-end VaR by risk category.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our daily VaR decreased to $65 million as of December 2017 from $82 million as of December 2016, primarily due to reductions in the currency rates, commodity prices and equity prices categories, partially offset by a decrease in the diversification effect and an increase in the interest rates category. The overall decrease was primarily due to lower levels of volatility.  

Our daily VaR increased to $82 million as of December 2016 from $67 million as of December 2015, primarily due to an increase in the equity prices category and a decrease in the diversification effect, partially offset by a decrease in the currency rates category. The overall increase was primarily due to increased exposures.  

During 2017 and 2016, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded, raised or reduced. During 2015, the firmwide VaR risk limit was temporarily raised on two occasions in order to facilitate client transactions. Separately, in March 2015, the firmwide VaR risk limit was reduced, reflecting lower risk utilization over the prior year.  

The table below presents high and low VaR by risk category.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The high and low total VaR was $86 million and $37 million, respectively, for the year ended December 2017. 

The chart below reflects our daily VaR over the last four quarters.  

The chart below presents the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in VaR for 2017.  

Daily net revenues for positions included in VaR are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions did not exceed our 95% one-day VaR during 2017, 2016 and 2015 (i.e., a VaR exception).  

During periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.

Sensitivity Measures  

Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. Other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.  

10% Sensitivity Measures. The table below presents market risk for positions, accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR by asset category.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

     

The market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10% decline in the value of these positions.  

     

Equity positions relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds.  

     

Debt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans.  

     

Equity and debt funded positions are included in our consolidated statements of financial condition in financial instruments owned. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about cash instruments.  

     

These measures do not reflect the diversification effect across asset categories or across other market risk measures. 

Credit Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities. VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was a gain of $3 million and $2 million (including hedges) as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $35 million and $25 million as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.  

Interest Rate Sensitivity. Loans receivable as of December 2017 and December 2016 were $65.93 billion and $49.67 billion, respectively, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. As of December 2017 and December 2016, the estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $527 million and $405 million, respectively, of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans receivable.  

Other Market Risk Considerations  

As of December 2017 and December 2016, we had commitments and held loans for which we have obtained credit loss protection from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about such lending commitments.  

In addition, we make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale and included in financial instruments owned in the consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  

We also make investments accounted for under the equity method and we also make direct investments in real estate, both of which are included in other assets. Direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets.

Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures  

We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections above, to monitor market risk across the consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of earnings. The related gains and losses on these positions are included in market making, other principal transactions, interest income and interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Credit Risk Management  

Overview  

Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and receivables from brokers, dealers, clearing organizations, customers and counterparties. 

Credit Risk Management, which is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing credit risk. The Firmwide Risk Committee and the Risk Governance Committee establish and review credit policies and parameters. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk Management, consistent with other inventory positions. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk Management.  

Credit Risk Management Process  

Effective management of credit risk requires accurate and timely information, a high level of communication and knowledge of customers, countries, industries and products. Our process for managing credit risk includes:  

     

Approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits;  

     

Establishing or approving underwriting standards;  

     

Monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits;  

     

Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;  

     

Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default;  

     

Reporting of credit exposures to senior management, the Board and regulators;  

     

Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and  

     

Communicating and collaborating with other independent control and support functions such as operations, legal and compliance.  

As part of the risk assessment process, Credit Risk Management performs credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterpartys industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel within Credit Risk Management, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, such as delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.  

Our global credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economic groups). These systems also provide management with comprehensive information on our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.  

Risk Measures and Limits  

We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.  

We use credit limits at various levels (e.g., counterparty, economic group, industry and country), as well as underwriting standards to control the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing risk appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations.  

The Risk Committee of the Board and the Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Committee) approve credit risk limits at firmwide, business and product levels, consistent with our risk appetite statement. Credit Risk Management (through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee) sets credit limits for individual counterparties, economic groups, industries and countries. Policies authorized by the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Risk Governance Committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for us to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across all product areas, taking into account any applicable netting provisions, collateral or other credit risk mitigants. 

Stress Tests  

We use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements. Some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring.  

We perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. Stress tests are conducted jointly with our market and liquidity risk functions.  

Model Review and Validation  

Our potential credit exposure and stress testing models, and any changes to such models or assumptions, are reviewed by Model Risk Management. See Model Risk Management for further information about the review and validation of these models.  

Risk Mitigants  

To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral on a daily basis to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.  

When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterpartys financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterpartys obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.  

Credit Exposures  

As of December 2017, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with December 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in loans and lending commitments. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) increased as compared with December 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in non-investment-grade loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2017 was higher as compared with our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during the prior year, and substantially all of such exposure related to loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2017 remained low, representing less than 0.5% of our total credit exposure, and estimated losses, while higher compared with the prior year, were still not material. Our credit exposures are described further below.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents. Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly-rated banks and central banks. 

The table below presents our credit exposure related to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents by industry, region and credit quality.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $18.44 billion and $14.65 billion as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively.  

OTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.  

Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.

The table below presents the distribution of our credit exposure to OTC derivatives by tenor, both before and after the effect of collateral and netting agreements.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table above:  

     

Tenor is based on expected duration for mortgage-related credit derivatives and generally on remaining contractual maturity for other derivatives.  

     

Counterparty netting within the same tenor category is included within such tenor category. Counterparty netting across tenor categories, as well as cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements, is included in netting. 

     

Net credit exposure represents OTC derivative assets, included in financial instruments owned, less cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, which management considers when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.

     

Commercial Lending. Our commercial lending activities include lending to investment-grade and non-investment-grade corporate borrowers. Loans and lending commitments associated with these activities are principally used for operating liquidity and general corporate purposes or in connection with contingent acquisitions. Corporate loans may be secured or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors. Our commercial lending activities also include extending loans to borrowers that are secured by commercial and other real estate.  

The table below presents our credit exposure related to commercial loans and lending commitments by industry, region and credit quality.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

     

Private Wealth Management and Retail Lending. We extend loans and lending commitments to our Private Wealth Management clients that are primarily secured by residential real estate, securities or other assets. The fair value of the collateral received against such loans and lending commitments generally exceeds their carrying value. The gross exposure related to such loans and lending commitments was $24.86 billion and $22.51 billion as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. Our regional net credit exposure related to these activities was approximately 90% and 92% in the Americas, approximately 5% and 5% in EMEA, and approximately 5% and 3% in Asia as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. 

In addition, we extend unsecured loans to retail clients through Marcus. The gross exposure related to such loans was $1.91 billion and $208 million as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the credit quality indicators of such loans.  

We also purchase and have commitments to purchase loans (including distressed loans) and securities. Such loans and securities are primarily backed by residential real estate. The gross exposure related to such loans and lending commitments was $10.24 billion and $5.38 billion as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively. Our regional net credit exposure related to these activities was approximately 74% and 79% in the Americas and approximately 26% and 21% in EMEA as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively.  

Securities Financing Transactions. We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral obtained for securities financing transactions primarily includes U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations. We had $29.07 billion and $28.64 billion as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively, of credit exposure related to securities financing transactions reflecting both netting agreements and collateral that management considers when determining credit risk. As of both December 2017 and December 2016, substantially all of our credit exposure related to securities financing transactions was with investment-grade financial institutions, funds, governments and municipalities and nonprofits, primarily located in the Americas and EMEA.

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Other Credit Exposures. We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables. Our net credit exposure related to these activities was $34.32 billion and $31.39 billion as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively, and primarily consisted of initial margin (both cash and securities) placed with investment-grade clearing organizations. Our regional net credit exposure related to these activities was approximately 41% and 44% in the Americas, approximately 49% and 42% in EMEA, and approximately 10% and 14% in Asia as of December 2017 and December 2016, respectively.  

Selected Exposures  

We have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus due to recent events and broad market concerns. Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short inventory due to changes in market prices.  

The debt crisis in Mozambique has resulted in credit rating downgrades and Venezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt. Our total credit and market exposure to each of Mozambique and Venezuela as of December 2017 was not material.  

We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underliers assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. 

We use regular stress tests, described above, to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors. To supplement these regular stress tests, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. These stress tests are designed to estimate the direct impact of the event on our credit and market exposures resulting from shocks to risk factors including, but not limited to, currency rates, interest rates, and equity prices. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.  

See Stress Tests above, Liquidity Risk Management  Liquidity Stress Tests and Market Risk Management  Market Risk Management Process  Stress Testing for further information about stress tests.  

Operational Risk Management  

Overview  

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.  

Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:  

     

Clients, products and business practices;  

     

Execution, delivery and process management;  

     

Business disruption and system failures;  

     

Employment practices and workplace safety;  

     

Damage to physical assets;  

     

Internal fraud; and  

     

External fraud.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

We maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Conduct and Operational Risk Committee is globally responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks, policies, parameters and limits which govern our operational risks. Operational Risk Management is a risk management function independent of our revenue-producing units, reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for developing and implementing policies, methodologies and a formalized framework for operational risk management with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.  

Operational Risk Management Process  

Managing operational risk requires timely and accurate information, as well as a strong control culture. We seek to manage our operational risk through:  

     

Training, supervision and development of our people;  

     

Active participation of senior management in identifying and mitigating our key operational risks;  

     

Independent control and support functions that monitor operational risk on a daily basis, and implementation of extensive policies and procedures, and controls designed to prevent the occurrence of operational risk events;  

     

Proactive communication between our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions; and  

     

A network of systems to facilitate the collection of data used to analyze and assess our operational risk exposure.  

We combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, revenue-producing units and independent control and support functions are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks to senior management.  

Our operational risk management framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.  

Our operational risk management framework consists of the following practices:  

     

Risk identification and assessment;  

     

Risk measurement; and  

     

Risk monitoring and reporting. 

Risk Identification and Assessment  

The core of our operational risk management framework is risk identification and assessment. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.  

We have established policies that require our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.  

In addition, our systems capture internal operational risk event data, key metrics such as transaction volumes, and statistical information such as performance trends. We use an internally developed operational risk management application to aggregate and organize this information. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by managers from both revenue-producing units and independent control and support functions. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.  

Risk Measurement  

We measure our operational risk exposure over a twelve-month time horizon using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors including but not limited to:  

     

Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;  

     

The degree of automation in our processes;  

     

New activity information;  

     

The legal and regulatory environment; and  

     

Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis  

The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses ultimately are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold.  

Risk Monitoring and Reporting  

We evaluate changes in our operational risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring the factors noted above at a firmwide level. We have both preventive and detective internal controls, which are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational risk losses and the probability of operational risk events. We monitor the results of assessments and independent internal audits of these internal controls.  

We have established limits and thresholds consistent with our risk appetite statement, as well as escalation protocols. We provide periodic operational risk reports, which include instances that breach escalation thresholds, to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board.  

Model Review and Validation  

The statistical models utilized by Operational Risk Management are subject to independent review and validation by Model Risk Management. See Model Risk Management for further information about the review and validation of these models.  

Model Risk Management  

Overview  

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and financial liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital.  

Our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework. Model Risk Management, which is independent of model developers, model owners and model users, reports to our chief risk officer, is responsible for identifying and reporting significant risks associated with models, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Model Review and Validation  

Model Risk Management consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. Model Risk Management reviews all existing models on an annual basis, and approves new models or significant changes to models prior to implementation.  

The model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:  

     

The models conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;  

     

The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;  

     

The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;  

     

The models accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;  

     

The models consistency with models for similar products; and  

     

The models sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.  

See Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value  Review of Valuation Models, Liquidity Risk Management, Market Risk Management, Credit Risk Management and Operational Risk Management for further information about our use of models within these areas.
