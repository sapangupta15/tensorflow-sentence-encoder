ITEM 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. The notes to our December 31, 2011 financial statements, primarily Note 2, summarize the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures. 

We believe the following are our critical accounting policies, because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Income Tax Expense: We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax if we distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) each year, and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules. We believe we have met these REIT requirements in 2011 and for all other periods presented herein. Accordingly, we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income. 

Our assumption that we have met the REIT requirements could be incorrect, because the REIT requirements are complex, require ongoing factual determinations, and there could be future unanticipated changes in our circumstances, or circumstances in previous years that we did not identify could affect our compliance. For any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income and could be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income would be materially different from our current estimates. 

In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as a regular corporation. To the extent that amounts paid to us by our taxable REIT subsidiaries are in excess of amounts that would be paid under similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments. If we became subject to such a penalty tax, our net income could be materially overstated from our current estimates.  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Substantially all of our assets, consisting primarily of real estate, are long-lived assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows, and determining fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. Others could come to materially different conclusions than we did regarding impairment. In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment. Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in assumptions as to cash flows or fair values, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Accruals for Operating Expenses: Certain of our expenses are estimated based upon assumptions regarding past and future trends, such as losses for workers compensation, employee health plans, and estimated claims for our tenant reinsurance program. Our property tax expense represents one of our largest operating expenses and has significant estimated components. Most notably, in certain jurisdictions we do not receive tax bills for the current fiscal year until after our earnings are finalized, and as a result, we must estimate tax expense based upon anticipated implementation of regulations and trends. If these estimates and assumptions with respect to these operating expenses were incorrect, our expenses could be misstated. 

28 

Accruals for Contingencies: We are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred, but in accordance with GAAP, we have not accrued for certain potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not reasonably estimable or because we are not aware of the event. Future events and the results of further investigation or litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and reasonably estimable, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Valuation of real estate and intangible assets acquired: In reporting the acquisition of operating self-storage facilities in our financial statements, we must estimate the fair value of the land, buildings, and intangible assets acquired in these transactions. These estimates are based upon many assumptions, subject to a significant degree of judgment, including estimating discount rates, replacement costs of land and buildings, future cash flows from the tenant base in place at the time of the acquisition, and future revenues to be earned and expenses to be incurred with respect to acquired properties. We believe that the assumptions we used were reasonable, however, others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated values, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, as well as the amounts included on our balance sheets for real estate and intangible assets. 

Overview of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations 

Our principal business activities include the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of self-storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the U.S., which represents our Domestic Self-Storage segment. A large portion of management time is focused on maximizing revenues and managing expenses at our self-storage facilities, which is the primary driver of growth in our net income and cash flow from operations and contributed 92% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. 

The remainder of our operations is comprised of our European Self-Storage segment through our investment in Shurgard Europe, our Commercial segment through our investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”), and the operations not allocated to any segment, each of which is described in Note 11 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements. 

The self-storage industry is subject to general economic conditions, particularly conditions that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends. Due to the recessionary pressures in the U.S., rental income was negatively impacted in 2009. Demand began to improve in 2010 and, as a result, rental income trends improved each quarter in 2010 and 2011, trending positive on a year-over-year basis since the third quarter of 2010. While trends have been improving, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue. 

Our ability to effectively deploy capital to expand our asset base is an important component of our long-term growth. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired 42 self-storage facilities for $239.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired 11 self-storage facilities for $80.4 million, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries owning self-storage facilities for $175.5 million, and we invested $116.6 million in Shurgard Europe to fund its acquisition of the remaining interests it did not own in 72 self-storage facilities. 

We believe that there may be opportunities to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties in 2012, because we continue to see self-storage facilities come to market. However, there is significant competition for facilities marketed in many of the geographic locations we find attractive. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire facilities on terms we find attractive. 

Due to the challenging operating environment, we have substantially curtailed our development activities. We continue to have a nominal development pipeline at December 31, 2011. 

Other investments we have made in the past, and may make in the future, include i) further investment in Shurgard Europe to allow it to develop or acquire facilities, ii) further investment in PSB, and iii) the early retirement of debt or redemption of preferred securities. There can be no assurance that these other investment alternatives will be attractive in the long-term, or will be even be available as investment alternatives. 

29 

We believe that we are not dependent upon raising capital to fund our operations or meet our obligations, due to our low levels of debt and significant cash from operations available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below). However, access to capital is important to growing our asset base. We choose between the issuance of common and preferred securities based upon the relative cost of capital. For at least the last ten years, we have raised cash proceeds for growth and other corporate purposes primarily through the issuance of preferred securities, while we have issued common stock only in connection with mergers and the acquisition of interests in real estate entities. Our ability to raise capital at favorable costs is dependent upon capital market conditions. When market conditions were favorable, we have generally been able to raise capital as necessary; however, there can be no assurance that future market conditions will permit us to raise capital at favorable costs. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we issued approximately $862.5 million and $270.0 million, respectively, of preferred securities, and on January 12, 2012, we issued another $460.0 million of preferred securities. 

At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $139.0 million of cash and we have access to a $300 million line of credit which expires March 27, 2012 and is expected to be extended, subject to agreeing to satisfactory renewal terms. At December 31, 2011, we have no significant commitments until 2013, when $264.9 million of existing debt comes due. On January 12, 2012 we received net proceeds of $446.2 million in connection with the issuance of our Series S Cumulative Preferred Shares. On February 9, 2012, we paid $206.7 million (excluding accrued dividends) to redeem our Series L Cumulative Preferred Shares. On February 21, 2012, we paid $141.3 million (excluding accrued dividends) to redeem our Series E Cumulative Preferred Shares. On March 19, 2012, we will pay $8.8 million (excluding accrued dividends) to redeem our Series Y Cumulative Preferred Shares. As of February 24, 2012, we are under contract to acquire a portfolio of six self-storage properties, located in California, Florida (two), Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for an aggregate purchase price of $42 million, cash. We expect the pending acquisition of these properties will close in the first quarter of 2012. The pending acquisition is subject to various conditions and contingencies and there can be no assurance that it will be completed. 

Results of Operations                          

 Operating results for 2011 as compared to 2010: For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $561.7 million or $3.29 per diluted common share, compared to $399.2 million or $2.35 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $162.5 million or $0.94 per diluted common share. This increase is due to (i) improved property operations, (ii) decreased foreign currency exchange loss of $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $42.3 million for the same period in 2010, (iii) increased equity in earnings and interest and other income from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europe’s acquisition of its joint venture partner’s interests on March 2, 2011, and (iv) reduced income allocations to our Equity Shares, Series A.  

Operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009: For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $399.2 million or $2.35 per diluted common share, compared to $586.0 million or $3.47 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $186.8 million or $1.12 per diluted common share. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a foreign currency exchange loss of $42.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a gain of $9.7 million during the same period in 2009, (ii) an aggregate $35.8 million increase in income allocated to the shareholders of redeemed securities, (including our equity share of PSB’s redemptions) in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to a $94.5 million decrease in income allocated to shareholders of redeemed securities (including our equity share of PSB’s redemptions), in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the same period in 2009 and (iii) a gain on disposition of real estate assets of $30.3 million related to an equity offering by PSB recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009.

Funds from Operations 

For the year ended December 31, 2011, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $5.67 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $4.72 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $0.95 per diluted common share. 

For the year ended December 31, 2011, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $7.3 million (compared to a $42.3 million loss for the same period in 2010) and a $32.6 million net charge related to our redemptions of equity securities, including our equity share from PSB, in applying EITF D-42 (compared to $35.8 million for the same period in 2010). 

For the year ended December 31, 2010, FFO was $4.72 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $5.61 per diluted common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $0.89 per diluted common share. 

For the year ended December 31, 2010, FFO was impacted by a $35.8 million reduction in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of preferred shares and our Equity Shares, Series A, including our equity share of PSB’s redemptions (compared to an aggregate $94.5 million increase recorded for our redemptions, and our equity share of PSB’s redemptions, of preferred equity in the same period in 2009) and a foreign currency exchange loss totaling $42.3 million (compared to a gain of $9.7 million for the same period in 2009). 

Our FFO for each period was also impacted by various items such as impairment charges, acquisition due diligence costs, changes in accounting estimates, gains and losses on early redemption of debt (including our equity share from PSB and Shurgard Europe), impairment charges, as well as our equity share of PSB’s lease termination fees received from tenants. The net impact of these items reduced FFO by $0.03, $0.04 and $0.04 per diluted common share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), is a non-GAAP financial measure. It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. The following table reconciles from our net income to funds from operations, and sets forth the calculations of FFO per share.

Real Estate Operations                            

Self-Storage Operations: Our self-storage operations are by far the largest component of our operating activities, representing more than 91% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Management analyzes the results of the Company’s consolidated self-storage operations in two-groups: (i) the Same Store facilities, representing the facilities in the Domestic Self-Storage Segment that we have owned and have been operating on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2009, and (ii) all other facilities in the Domestic Self-Storage Segment, which are primarily those consolidated facilities that we have not owned and operated at a stabilized basis since January 1, 2009 such as newly acquired, newly developed, or recently expanded facilities. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

      (a)   See “Net Operating Income or NOI” below.    

Net income with respect to our self-storage operations increased by $79.4 million or 11.9% during the year ended December 31, 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010. This was due to a 6.6% increase in net operating income with respect to our Same Store Facilities due to increased revenues driven by higher occupancy and higher realized rents per occupied square foot, and a 43.3% increase in net operating income with respect to the Non Same Store Facilities, due primarily to the impact of the properties acquired in 2010 and 2011. This was partially offset by a $4.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization, due primarily to increased depreciation with respect to the facilities acquired in 2011 and 2010. Net income with respect to our self-storage operations increased by $0.8 million or 0.1% during the year ended December 31, 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009. This was due to a 0.2% increase in net operating income with respect to our Same Store Facilities due to increased revenues driven by higher occupancy partially offset by lower realized rents per occupied square foot, and a 39.6% increase in net operating income with respect to the Non Same Store Facilities, due primarily to the impact of the 42 facilities acquired in 2010. This was partially offset by a $14.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization, due primarily to increased amortization of tenant intangible assets with respect to the facilities acquired in 2010.

Same Store Facilities 

The “Same Store Facilities” represents those 1,931 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009, 2010, and 2011. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,931 facilities (121.6 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2011. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. “Other costs of management” included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities.    

34 

  b)    See “Net Operating Income” below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our net income in our statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.    

  c)    Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.    

  d)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income (which excludes late charges and administrative fees) by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due.    

  e)    Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF. Exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are charged upon move-in volumes and are therefore dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period.    

  f)    Realized annual rent per available foot or “REVPAF” is computed by dividing rental income (which excludes late charges and administrative fees) by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.    

  g)    In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees.    

Revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was due primarily to a 1.4% increase in weighted average square foot occupancy and a 2.8% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot, as well as an 11.2% increase in late charges and administrative fees due primarily to increases in the fee levels charged for late payments. The increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot includes the impact of aggressive increases in rates charged to our existing tenants in the last two quarters of 2011. 

Revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to a 5.9% increase in late charges and administrative fees due primarily to increases in the fee levels charged for late payments. Rental income was flat on a year-over-year basis as average occupancy was 1.2% higher, offset by a 1.1% reduction in realized annual rent per occupied square foot. 

Our operating strategy is to maintain occupancy levels for our Same Store Facilities at an average of approximately 90% for the full year. In order to achieve this strategy, we evaluate changes in traffic patterns of new tenants renting space and the volume of existing tenants vacating, and in response we increase or decrease rental rates, promotional discounts offered to new tenants, and the frequency of television advertising. We experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months. Consequently, rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months. 

Our self-storage revenues suffered negative operating trends in late 2008 and 2009 due to recessionary pressures, including increased unemployment, reduced housing sales, and reduced moving activity, in the major markets in which we operate. However, trends in occupancy and realized rent per square foot have steadily improved in our Same Store Facilities in 2010 and 2011, and we have had more pricing power, resulting in rental income increases on a year-over-year basis beginning in the third quarter of 2010. Our rent growth accelerated in the last two quarters of 2011, due primarily to rate increases to existing tenants. 

Notwithstanding improved occupancy levels in 2010 and 2011, we will continue to be competitive in our pricing and discounting in order to compete with other operators to attract new incoming tenants. We expect positive year-over-year growth in rental income to continue in the year ending December 31, 2012. 

Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 0.4% in 2011, as compared to 2010. Increases in property taxes, other advertising and promotion, other costs of management, and utilities were partially offset by decreases in media advertising and telephone reservation center costs in 2011, as compared to 2010. Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 0.8% in 2010, as compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily to increases in repairs and maintenance and direct property payroll, offset by a reduction in media advertising and lower property tax expense. 

35 

Property tax expense increased 2.0% in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher tax rates. Property tax expense decreased 1.0% in 2010, as compared to 2009 due to reduced assessments of property values combined with an increase in refunds associated with appeals for prior years’ tax liabilities that were experienced in Texas, Illinois, New York, Virginia and Florida. We expect property tax expense growth of approximately 4.5% in 2012. 

Direct property payroll expense increased 1.0% in 2011, as compared to 2010, and increased by 2.2% in 2010, as compared to 2009. These increases were due primarily to higher incentives and wage rates paid to property personnel. We expect moderate growth in payroll expense in 2012. 

Media advertising decreased 30.3% in 2011, as compared to 2010, and 27.0% in 2010, as compared to 2009. These decreases are due primarily to reductions in television advertising costs as we continued to decrease the number of markets in which we advertised. Media advertising primarily includes the cost of advertising on television, and spending levels can vary considerably depending on a number of factors, including our occupancy levels, the demand for storage space, and the relative cost and availability of television advertising spots. 

Other advertising and promotion is comprised principally of yellow page and Internet advertising, which increased 6.5% in 2011, as compared to 2010, and 7.1% in 2010, as compared to 2009. These increases are due primarily to higher Internet advertising expenditures as we continue to invest and improve our positioning on major Internet search engines by bidding more aggressively on keywords related to our business. These increases were offset in 2010 by decreased yellow page spending compared to 2009 due to revised compensation fee arrangements with yellow page providers to better reflect the reduced effectiveness of this media. 

Our future spending on yellow page, media, and Internet advertising expenditures will be driven in part by demand for our self-storage spaces, our occupancy levels, and the relative cost and efficacy of each type of advertising. Media advertising costs in particular can be volatile and increase or decrease significantly in the short-term. 

Utility expenses increased 4.0% in 2011, as compared to 2010. The increase is due to increased usage caused by extreme temperatures and, to a lesser extent, increased energy prices. Utility expenses decreased 0.8% in 2010, as compared to 2009. The decrease was due primarily to reduced year-over-year energy prices. It is difficult to estimate future utility cost levels because utility costs are primarily dependent upon changes in demand driven by weather and temperature, as well as fuel prices, each of which are volatile and not predictable. 

Repairs and maintenance expenditures decreased 1.9% in 2011, as compared to 2010, and increased 16.5% in 2010, as compared to 2009. The decrease in 2011 is due primarily to a $1.7 million reduction in snow removal expenses, due to severe weather in 2010, which increased snow removal expenses $1.9 million, as compared to 2009. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are dependent upon several factors, such as weather, the timing of periodic needs throughout our portfolio, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events and accordingly can vary considerably from year to year and are difficult to project. 

Telephone reservation center costs decreased 14.5% in 2011, as compared to 2010, and 0.7% in 2010, as compared to 2009. The reductions were primarily due to improved staffing management in our call centers. We expect telephone reservation center cost to grow moderately in 2012. 

Insurance expense decreased 2.7% in 2011, as compared to 2010, and 3.2% in 2010, as compared to 2009. We expect insurance expense in 2012 to grow moderately compared to 2011.

Analysis of Regional Trends 

The following table sets forth selected regional trends in our Same Store Facilities: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

38 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows. It is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results. Over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics. 

Non Same Store Facilities 

The Non Same Store Facilities include 111 facilities that were either recently acquired, recently developed, or were recently expanded by adding additional rentable square feet. In general, these facilities are not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates. As a result of the fill-up process and timing of when the facilities were put into place, year-over-year changes can be significant. 

On the following table, the line-item “Facilities placed into service in 2011” includes 11 facilities acquired from third parties, one facility that was newly developed, and two facilities that we obtained control of and began consolidating in the year ended December 31, 2011. “Facilities placed into service in 2010” is comprised of 42 facilities acquired from third parties in 2010. “Expansion facilities” represent those other facilities that were recently expanded by the addition of more net rentable square feet. 

The following table summarizes operating data with respect to these facilities: 

39 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    See “Net Operating Income” below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our net income in our statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.    

40 

In 2011, we acquired 11 facilities for an aggregate cost of $80.4 million. The weighted average aggregate capitalization rates for these acquisitions, based upon annualizing the net operating income of these facilities for the period we owned them during the year ended December 31, 2011, was approximately 7.0% and the average occupancy was 76.9%. 

In addition, during 2011, we obtained control of two entities we had a partial interest in, and began consolidating the two stabilized self-storage facilities (143,000 net rentable square feet) owned by these entities. We recorded approximately $1.1 million in revenues and $0.2 million in operating expenses with respect to these facilities during the year ended December 31, 2011. 

During 2011, we completed the expansion of four facilities, and converted a commercial facility into a self-storage facility, for an aggregate of $21.8 million (325,000 net rentable square feet). 

In 2010, we acquired 42 facilities for an aggregate acquisition cost of $239.6 million. Thirty-two of the facilities are located in California (primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco), three facilities are located in Chicago, IL., two facilities are located in West Palm Beach, FL., and one facility each is located in Atlanta, GA., Honolulu, HI., New Orleans, LA., Newark, NJ., and Columbus, OH. The weighted average capitalization rate for these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately 8.4%. 

We believe that our management, promotion, and operating infrastructure will result in newly acquired facilities stabilizing at a higher level of net operating income than was achieved by the previous owners, who are typically smaller operators. However, it can take 24 or more months for these newly acquired facilities to reach stabilization, and the ultimate levels of rent to be achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions. As a result, there can be no assurance that our expectations with respect to these facilities will be achieved. However, we expect the Other Facilities will continue to provide earnings growth during 2012 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels, and the earnings of 2011 acquisitions are reflected in our operations for a full year. 

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities 

At December 31, 2011, we have equity investments in PSB, Shurgard Europe and various limited partnerships that own an aggregate of 17 self-storage facilities with approximately one million net rentable square feet of storage space. Due to our limited ownership interest and lack control of these entities, we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes, and account for such investments using the equity method. 

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, consists of our pro-rata share of the net income of these unconsolidated real estate entities based upon our ownership interest for the period. The following table sets forth the significant components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities. Amounts with respect to PSB, Shurgard Europe, and Other Investments, respectively, are included in our Commercial, European Self-Storage, and Domestic Self-Storage segments, respectively, as described in Note 11 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements.

Investment in PSB: At December 31 2011, we have a 42% (41% at December 31, 2010) common equity interest in PSB, comprised of our ownership of 5,801,606 shares of PSB’s common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in PSB’s underlying operating partnership. The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into PSB common stock. Our ownership interest was reduced to 41% during 2009 as PSB sold 3,833,333 shares of its common stock, of which we purchased 383,333 shares or 10% of the shares issued. 

At December 31 2011, PSB owned and operated 27.2 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in eight states. PSB also manages commercial space owned by the Company and affiliated entities pursuant to property management agreements. 

Equity in earnings from PSB increased to $27.8 million in 2011 as compared to $20.7 million in 2010. This increase was principally due to (i) incremental income generated by properties that PSB acquired in 2010 and 2011, (ii) reduced income allocations to PSB’s preferred securities, due to redemptions, partially offset by (iii) increased depreciation and interest expense, each as a result of the property acquisitions. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements for selected financial information on PSB. 

Equity in earnings from PSB decreased to $20.7 million in 2010 as compared to $35.1 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily the result of recognizing our pro rata share, $16.3 million, of the benefit that PSB recognized during 2009 as a result of PSB’s preferred stock and preferred partnership unit repurchases. This decrease was partially offset by our pro rata share, $2.1 million, of PSB’s gain on disposition of a property. Equity in earnings was also negatively impacted during 2010 compared to 2009 by our pro-rata share, $4.5 million, of reduced property net operating income due primarily to a 4.1% decline in the annualized realized rent per square foot for PSB’s “Same Park” facilities for 2010, as compared to 2009. 

We expect our future equity income from PSB to be dependent entirely upon PSB’s operating results. Our investment in PSB provides us with some diversification into another asset type. We have no plans of disposing of our investment in PSB. PSB’s filings and selected financial information can be accessed through the Securities and Exchange Commission, and on PSB’s website, www.psbusinessparks.com. 

Investment in Shurgard Europe: 

Recent developments in Shurgard Europe’s business: At December 31, 2011, and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, we have a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe. Our equity in earnings of Shurgard Europe is comprised of our 49% equity share of Shurgard Europe’s net income. At December 31, 2011, Shurgard Europe’s operations are comprised of 188 wholly-owned facilities with 10 million net rentable square feet. Selected financial data for Shurgard Europe for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011 is included in Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements. As described in more detail in Note 4, we receive interest income and trademark license fees from Shurgard Europe, of which 49% is classified as equity in earnings and the remaining 51% as interest and other income. 

On March 2, 2011, Shurgard Europe acquired the remaining 80% interests in two joint venture partnerships owning 72 self-storage facilities (the “Acquired JV Interests”), in which Shurgard Europe had a preexisting 20% equity interest, for €172.0 million plus the assumption of €159.0 million of debt (representing 80% of the existing debt of the two joint ventures). We loaned Shurgard Europe $237.9 million (€172.1 million) to fund this acquisition. On June 15, 2011, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe effectively purchased 51% of the loan from us for $121.3 million, and the entire loan was effectively exchanged for an equity interest in Shurgard Europe. 

In November 2011, Shurgard Europe obtained a new three year term loan of €215 million from Wells Fargo (the “Wells Fargo Loan”), and used the proceeds to repay approximately €183 million of debt, secured by the 72 facilities mentioned above, and made an additional principal payment of €32 million on the loan it owes to Public Storage. The Wells Fargo Loan has a lower interest rate than the debt repaid, and will provide Shurgard Europe the flexibility to simplify its ownership structure and eliminate various costs associated with the former joint ventures. In connection with this financing, we extended the maturity date of our loan to Shurgard Europe from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2015.

Analysis of our equity earnings in Shurgard Europe: Equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $29.2 million as compared to $15.9 million for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $13.3 million. This growth was primarily due to improvements to Shurgard Europe’s operating results as a result of (i) improved property operations, (ii) the acquisition of the Acquired JV Interests, described above, resulting in reduced allocations of income to permanent noncontrolling equity interests (conversely increased allocation to Shurgard Europe), and (iv) improved foreign currency exchange rates, see below. These items were partially offset by increased interest and general and administrative expenses. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements for selected financial information on Shurgard Europe. 

Equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $15.9 million as compared to $16.3 million for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $0.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to (i) increased depreciation and amortization, (ii) increased allocations of income to Shurgard Europe’s permanent noncontrolling equity interests and (iii) unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates, see below. 

Our equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe is affected by exchange rates, most notably the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. The average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar to the Euro increased 5.0% in the year ended December 31, 2011, from 1.326 for the year ended December 31, 2010 to 1.392 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The average exchange rate for the U.S. Dollar to the Euro decreased 4.8% in the year ended December 31, 2010, from 1.393 for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 1.326 for the year ended December 31, 2010. 

Shurgard Europe has a nominal development pipeline. Accordingly, at least in the short-term, we do not expect any significant impact to our earnings from Shurgard Europe’s development activities, other than the continued fill-up of Shurgard Europe’s existing unstabilized facilities. Our future earnings from Shurgard Europe will be affected primarily by the operating results of its existing stabilized facilities described below, which represent 150 of the 188 facilities that Shurgard Europe owns. 

European Same-Store Facilities: The Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool represents those 150 facilities that are wholly-owned at December 31, 2011 (including 61 facilities owned by the two joint venture partnerships) and have been operated by Shurgard Europe at a stabilized occupancy level since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009, 2010 and 2011. We evaluate the performance of these facilities because Shurgard Europe’s ability to effectively manage stabilized facilities represents an important measure of its ability to grow its earnings over the long-term. The operating results of the Europe Same Store Facilities are more volatile than the operating results of our Same Store Facilities, because of the fewer number of properties in the Europe Same Store Facilities. 

The following table reflects 100% of the operating results of those 150 facilities, and we restate the exchange rates used in prior year’s presentation to the actual exchange rates for 2011. However, only our pro rata share of the operating results for these facilities, based upon the actual exchange rates for each period, is included in “equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities” on our statements of income. 

43 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    In order to isolate changes in the underlying operations from the impact of exchange rates, the amounts in this table are presented on a constant exchange rate basis. The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 have been restated using the actual exchange rate for 2011.    

  (b)    We present net operating income “NOI” of the Shurgard Europe Same-Store Facilities, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Although depreciation and amortization is a component of GAAP net income, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, the investment community utilizes NOI in determining real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense as it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization in evaluating our operating results.    

  (c)    Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.    

  (d)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income before late charges and administrative fees by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due.    

  (e)    Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF. Exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue.    

44 

  (f)    Realized annual rent per available foot or “REVPAF” is computed by dividing rental income before late charges and administrative fees by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.    

  (g)    In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees.    

Net operating income increased 0.7% from $105.8 million in 2010 to $106.5 million 2011, and 6.2% from $99.6 million in 2009 to $105.8 million in 2010. These increases were attributable primarily to increased realized rent per occupied square foot. Based upon current operating trends and metrics, we do not expect any growth in the net operating income of the Europe Same Store Facilities in 2012. In Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements, we disclose Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results include additional facilities that are not Europe Same Store Facilities, and are based upon historical exchange rates rather than constant exchange rates for each of the respective periods. 

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Shurgard Europe” for additional information on Shurgard Europe’s liquidity. 

Other Investments: The “Other Investments” at December 31, 2011 are comprised primarily of our equity in earnings from various limited partnerships that collectively own 17 self-storage facilities. Our future earnings with respect to the Other Investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the facilities that these entities own. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements for the operating results of these 17 facilities under the “Other Investments.” 

Ancillary Operations 

Ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with (i) the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities in the U.S., (ii) merchandise sales (iii) commercial property operations, and (iv) management of facilities for third parties and facilities owned by the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities. 

Commercial property operations are included in our Commercial segment, and all other ancillary revenues and costs of operations are not allocated to any segment. See Note 11 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements for further information regarding our segments and for a reconciliation of these ancillary revenues and cost of operations to our net income. 

The following table sets forth our ancillary operations as presented on our statements of income. 

45 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Tenant reinsurance operations: We reinsure policies offered through a non-affiliated insurance company against losses to goods stored by tenants, primarily in our domestic self-storage facilities. The revenues that we record are based upon premiums that we reinsure. Cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses. Included in cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was a $2.8 million reduction related to changes in accounting estimates. 

The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues over the past year was due primarily to an increase in the percentage of our existing tenants retaining such policies, as well as an increase in the number of facilities due to the acquisition of 53 facilities in 2010 and 2011. On average, approximately 61%, 58%, and 57% of our tenants had such policies during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Assuming no further third party acquisitions of facilities, we believe that the growth in tenant reinsurance revenues in 2012 may not be as high as experienced in 2011 because we expect less growth in the percentage of tenants retaining insurance policies. 

The future level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon the number of new tenants electing to purchase policies, the level of premiums charged for such insurance, and the number of tenants that continue participating in the insurance program. Future cost of operations will be dependent primarily upon the level of losses incurred, including the level of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, that occur and affect our properties thereby increasing tenant insurance claims. 

Commercial operations: We also operate commercial facilities, primarily small storefronts and office space located on or near our existing self-storage facilities that are rented to third parties. We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our commercial operations. 

Merchandise sales and other: We sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at the self-storage facilities that we operate. The primary factor impacting the level of merchandise sales is the level of customer traffic at our self-storage facilities, including the level of move-ins. Merchandise sales and margins were negatively impacted in 2010, as compared to 2009 by reduced volume, driven primarily by a shift in the mix of locks sold to a more upscale but lower-margin product. The margins on those locks improved, due to higher selling prices, resulting in improved merchandise sales and margins in 2011, as compared to 2010. In addition, to a much lesser extent, we also manage self-storage facilities within our existing management infrastructure, for third party owners as well as for the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities. 

46 

Other Income and Expense Items 

Interest and other income: Interest and other income was $32.3 million in 2011, $29.0 million in 2010, and $29.8 million in 2009 and is comprised primarily of interest and other income from Shurgard Europe and, to a lesser extent, interest earned on cash balances. 

The interest and other income from Shurgard Europe is comprised of interest income on the loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, as well as trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe for the use of the “Shurgard” trade name. We record 51% of the aggregate interest income and trademark license fees as interest and other income, while 49% is presented as additional equity in earnings on our statements of income. 

Interest and other income from Shurgard Europe increased from $25.1 million in 2010 to $26.7 million in 2011, due primarily to an additional $237.9 million loan we provided to Shurgard Europe on March 2, 2011 (described more fully in Note 5 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements), bearing interest at 7%, which was extinguished on June 15, 2011, as well as an increase in the average exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to the Euro from 1.326 for 2010 as to 1.392 in 2011. We also received $1.5 million in interest and other income from our joint venture partner for funding its 51% pro rata share of Shurgard Europe’s cost of the Acquired JV Interests for the period from March 2, 2011 until June 15, 2011. 

Interest and other income from Shurgard Europe increased from $24.8 million in 2009 to $25.1 million in 2010, due primarily to an increase in the interest rate on the loan receivable from Shurgard Europe from 7.5% to 9.0%, effective November 1, 2009, in connection with an extension of the loan, partially offset by a decrease in the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar to 1.326 for 2010 as compared to 1.393 for 2009. 

The loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, denominated in Euros, totaling €311.0 million ($402.7 million) as of December 31, 2011 (€373.7 million ($495.2 million) as of December 31, 2010), matures in February 2015. During 2011 and 2010, Shurgard Europe repaid €62.7 million ($85.8 million) and €18.2 million ($24.5 million), respectively, on the note. Future interest income recorded in connection with this loan will be dependent upon the average outstanding balance as well as the exchange rate of the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar. All such interest has been paid currently when due and we expect the interest to continue to be paid when due with Shurgard Europe’s operating cash flow. The terms of a loan payable by Shurgard Europe to Wells Fargo, which require significant principal reduction through the maturity date in November 2014, will result in minimal principal repayment on our loan. 

The remainder of our interest and other income, comprised of interest earned on cash balances as well as other income items that are received from time to time in varying amounts, totaled $4.1 million, $3.9 million, and $5.0 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Interest income on cash balances has declined in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and during 2011 rates have been at historic lows. We expect future interest earned on cash balances, based upon current interest rates on our outstanding money-market fund investments of approximately 0.1% to be minimal. Future earnings from sundry other income items are not predictable. 

Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense was $358.4 million, $353.7 million and $339.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2011 as compared to 2010 is primarily due to depreciation of the real estate facilities we acquired in connection with the acquisition of 11 self-storage facilities during 2011 and 42 facilities during 2010. Partially offsetting this increase was a $1.4 million decrease in amortization expense with respect to tenant intangible assets which declined to $11.9 million for 2011, as compared to $13.3 million for 2010, as well as a $4.0 million reduction in depreciation expense on certain buildings that were placed in service more than 25 years ago and are fully depreciated as of December 31, 2011. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2010, as compared to 2009 is primarily due to amortization of the tenant intangible assets we acquired in connection with the acquisition of 42 self-storage facilities during 2010. Amortization expense with respect to tenant intangible assets was $13.3 million for 2010, as compared to $5.5 million for 2009. 

47 

We expect approximately $5.3 million in intangible amortization during the year ending December 31, 2012, with respect to our intangible assets at December 31, 2011. We expect an approximately $3.1 million reduction in depreciation in 2012, as compared to 2011 with respect to fully depreciated buildings. The level of future depreciation and amortization will also depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities, and the level of capital expenditures we incur on our facilities. 

General and administrative expense: General and administrative expense was $52.4 million, $38.5 million, and $35.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. General and administrative expense principally consists of state income taxes, investor relations expenses, and corporate and executive salaries. In addition, general and administrative expenses includes expenses that vary from year to year depending on our activity levels in certain areas and other factors, such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities, certain expenses related to capital raising and acquisition activities, litigation expenditures, employee severance, share-based compensation, and incentive compensation for corporate and executive personnel. 

The increase in general and administrative expense for 2011 as compared 2010 is due primarily to $11.3 million in share-based compensation expense related to a performance-based restricted share unit program described in Note 10 to our December 31, 2011 financial statements. The increase in general and administrative expense for 2010 as compared to 2009 was due primarily to $2.6 million in property acquisition related expenses. 

We expect to incur $6.1 million, $3.6 million, and $2.0 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, in share-based compensation expense related to our 2011 performance-based restricted share unit program, assuming no further grants of restricted share units under performance-based restricted share unit programs. Costs related to property acquisitions for 2012 are dependent on the level of acquisitions, which is not determinable at this time. 

Interest expense: Interest expense was $24.2 million, $30.2 million, and $29.9 million, for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest capitalized into real estate was nominal for all periods due to our minimal real estate development activities. 

The decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010 is due primarily to the repayment in February 2011 of approximately $103 million of unsecured notes payable with an effective rate of interest of 5.7%. The increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 is due to $1.4 million in interest expense on debt assumed in connection with property acquisitions during the quarter ended June 30, 2010. 

See Note 6 to our December 31, 2010 financial statements for a schedule of our notes payable balances, principal repayment requirements, and average interest rates. 

Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss): We recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $7.3 million, a loss of $42.3 million, and a gain of $9.7 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-based loan receivable from Shurgard Europe due to changes in exchange rates. We have not entered into any agreements to mitigate the impact of currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, therefore the amount of U.S. Dollars we will receive on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at that time. We record the exchange gains or losses into income each period because of our continued expectation of repayment of the loan in the foreseeable future. The U.S. Dollar exchange rate relative to the Euro was approximately 1.295, 1.325 and 1.433 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Future foreign exchange gains or losses will be dependent primarily upon the movement of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, the amount owed from Shurgard Europe and our continued expectation of collecting the principal on the loan in the foreseeable future. 

Discontinued Operations: The net income of real estate facilities or other businesses that have been sold or otherwise disposed of, or that we expect to sell or dispose of within the next year based upon a committed plan of disposal, are reclassified and presented on our income statement for all periods as “discontinued operations.” In addition to the revenues and expenses of disposed self-storage facilities, discontinued operations includes $2.7 million, $7.8 million and $6.0 million in net gains on disposition of real estate facilities in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, a $1.9 million impairment charge on real estate and intangible assets incurred in 2010, a $8.2 million impairment charge on intangible assets incurred in 2009, and $3.5 million in truck disposal expenses in 2009. 

48 

      Net Operating Income    

In our discussions above, we referred to net operating income (“NOI”) of our self-storage facilities, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Although depreciation and amortization are a component of GAAP net income, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, property performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense as it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization or net income in evaluating our operating results. The following reconciles NOI generated by our self-storage segment to our net income in our December 31, 2011 financial statements. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We believe that our cash balances and the internally generated net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses, debt service requirements, capital improvements and distribution requirements to our shareholders for the foreseeable future. 

Operating as a REIT, our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted. In order for us to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be distributed to our shareholders (see “Requirement to Pay Distributions” below). However, despite the significant distribution requirements, we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow. The following table summarizes our ability to fund capital improvements to maintain our facilities, distributions to the noncontrolling interests, capital improvements to maintain our facilities, and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities. The remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    Represents net cash provided by operating activities for each respective year as presented in our December 31, 2011 statements of cash flows.    

  (b)    We present cash from operations for principal payments on debt and reinvestment because we believe it is an important measure to evaluate our ongoing liquidity. This measure is not a substitute for cash flows from operations or net cash flows in evaluating our liquidity, ability to repay our debt, or to meet our distribution requirements.    

Our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt-to-total-capitalization. We expect to fund our long-term growth strategies and debt obligations with (i) cash at December 31, 2011, (ii) internally generated retained cash flows, (iii) depending upon market conditions, proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity securities, and (iv) in the case of acquisitions of facilities, the assumption of existing debt. In general, our strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital, either retained operating cash flow or capital raised through the issuance of common or preferred equity to the extent that market conditions are favorable. 

We have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt. We have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons: (i) under the REIT structure, a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders, making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone, (ii) our perpetual preferred shares have no sinking fund requirement or maturity date and do not require redemption, all of which eliminate future refinancing risks, (iii) after the end of a non-call period, we have the option to redeem the preferred shares at any time, which enables us to refinance higher coupon preferred shares with new preferred shares at lower rates if appropriate, (iv) preferred shares do not contain covenants, thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility, and (v) dividends on the preferred shares can be applied to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements. 

Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “Baa1” by Moody’s, “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A-” by Fitch Ratings. 

50 

Summary of Current Cash Balances and Short-term Capital Commitments: At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $139.0 million of cash. At December 31, 2011, we have no significant commitments until 2013, when $264.9 million of existing debt comes due. On January 12, 2012 we received net proceeds of $446.2 million in connection with the issuance of our Series S Cumulative Preferred Shares. A portion of these proceeds were used to redeem $206.7 million of our Series L Cumulative Preferred Shares and $141.3 million of our Series E Cumulative Preferred Shares in February 2012. On March 19, 2012, we will pay $8.8 million to redeem our Series Y Cumulative Preferred Shares. As of February 24, 2012, we are under contract to acquire a portfolio of six self-storage properties, located in California, Florida (two), Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for an aggregate purchase price of $42 million. We expect the pending acquisition of these properties will close in the first quarter of 2012. The pending acquisition is subject to various conditions and contingencies and there can be no assurance that it will be completed. 

Access to Additional Capital: We have a revolving line of credit for borrowings up to $300 million which expires on March 27, 2012, with no outstanding borrowings at February 24, 2012. We expect to obtain a new line of credit for the same amount prior to the expiration of our current line of credit. We seldom borrow on the line of credit and generally view borrowings on the line as a means to bridge capital needs until we are able to refinance them with permanent capital. 

We believe that we are not dependent upon raising capital to fund our operations or meet our obligations. However, access to capital is important to growing our asset base. When growth capital is needed, we select either common or preferred securities based upon the relative cost of capital. For at least the last ten years, we have raised cash proceeds for growth and other corporate purposes primarily through the issuance of preferred securities, while we have issued common stock only in connection with mergers and the acquisition of interests in real estate entities. During periods of favorable market conditions, we have generally been able to raise capital at attractive costs; however, we are dependent upon capital market conditions and there can be no assurance that future market conditions will be favorable. 

Debt Service Requirements: At December 31, 2011, outstanding debt totaled approximately $398.3 million. Approximate principal maturities are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Our current intention is to repay the debt at maturity and not seek to refinance debt maturities with additional debt. Alternatively, we may prepay debt and finance such prepayments with cash on-hand or proceeds from the issuance of preferred or common securities. 

Our portfolio of real estate facilities is substantially unencumbered. At December 31, 2011, we have 1,966 self-storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of approximately $6.9 billion that are unencumbered. 

Capital Improvement Requirements: Capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to elements of our facilities, which keep the facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal to the customer. Capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or the expansion of net rentable square footage of existing facilities. We incurred capital improvements totaling $69.8 million during 2011. During 2012, we expect to incur approximately $75 million for capital improvements and expect to fund such improvements with operating cash flow.

Requirement to Pay Distributions: We have operated, and intend to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the REIT taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders, provided that at least 90% of our taxable income is so distributed. We believe we have satisfied the REIT distribution requirement since 1981. 

Aggregate REIT qualifying distributions paid during 2011 totaled $846.2 million, consisting of $224.9 million to cumulative preferred shareholders and $621.3 million to common shareholders and restricted share unitholders. 

We estimate the distribution requirements with respect to our cumulative preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, adjusted for the redemptions of our Series L Cumulative Preferred Shared, our Series E Cumulative Preferred Shares and our Series Y Cumulative Preferred Shares and the issuance of our Series S Cumulative Preferred Shares noted above to be approximately $206 million per year. 

On February 23, 2012, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $1.10 per common share, which represents a 15.8% increase from the previous regular common dividend of $0.95 per common share. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Future distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with operating cash flow. 

We are obligated to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries based upon the operating cash flows of the respective subsidiary less any required reserves for capital expenditures or debt repayment. We paid $5.7 million in 2011 with respect to such non-controlling interests outstanding at December 31, 2011, which represents our expectation with respect to future distributions to these interests. 

Acquisition and Development Activities: At December 31, 2011, we were not under contract to acquire any properties. During 2012, we will continue to seek to acquire self-storage facilities from third parties; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake. As of February 24, 2012, we are under contract to acquire a portfolio of six self-storage properties for an aggregate purchase price of $42 million; all cash. We expect the pending acquisition of these properties will close in the first quarter of 2012. The pending acquisition is subject to various conditions and contingencies and there can be no assurance that it will be completed. We have a minimal development pipeline at December 31, 2011 and have no current plans to expand our development activities. We plan on financing our development and acquisition activities in one or more of the following ways: with available cash on-hand, the assumption of existing debt, borrowings on our line of credit, or the net proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred securities. 

Shurgard Europe: We have a 49% interest in Shurgard Europe and our institutional partner owns the remaining 51% interest. As of December 31, 2011, we had a €311.0 million loan receivable from Shurgard Europe totaling $402.7 million, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 9.0% per annum and matures February 15, 2015. The loan can be prepaid in part or in full at any time without penalty. This loan is denominated in Euros and is translated to U.S. Dollars for financial statement purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, Shurgard Europe repaid €62.7 million ($85.8 million). 

In November 2011, Shurgard Europe obtained a three year term loan of €215 million from Wells Fargo (the Wells Fargo Loan”), and used the proceeds to repay the JV Loans totaling €183 million and make an additional principal payment of €32 million on the Public Storage loan. The Wells Fargo Loan is without recourse to Public Storage or our institutional partner. 

Our loan to Shurgard Europe participates pari passu with the Wells Fargo Loan in a liquidation of Shurgard Europe. In addition, Shurgard Europe is obligated to utilize most of its available cashflow to make principal payments on the Wells Fargo Loan, which limits the principal payments that could otherwise be made on our loan. Future prepayments will be dependent upon Shurgard Europe’s management’s evaluation of uses for the capital available from operations after making principal payments on the Wells Fargo Loan, and the availability of other sources of capital. Further, consistent with prior years, we do not expect to receive cash distributions from Shurgard Europe with respect to our 49% equity interest for the foreseeable future.

Redemption of Preferred Securities: As of December 31, 2011, several series of our preferred securities were redeemable at our option upon at least 30 days’ notice with dividend rates ranging from 6.125% to 6.850% and have an aggregate redemption value of approximately $1.3 billion. Generally our strategy is to redeem a preferred security with the proceeds from the issuance of a new preferred series having a lower dividend rate, thus reducing our cost of capital, but not necessarily reducing our overall leverage. However, we may use cash on hand to redeem preferred securities, reducing our aggregate preferred securities outstanding. Accordingly, the redemption of any of the series of preferred securities that are callable will depend upon many factors including current dividend rates that we might pay on newly issued preferred securities, as well as comparison of the acquisition of preferred securities to other investment alternatives with respect to the use of cash on hand. None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders. 

During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we redeemed approximately $1.1 billion and $274 million, respectively, of preferred securities. In 2012 through February 24, 2012, we redeemed an additional $348 million in preferred securities. On March 19, 2012, we will redeem an additional $8.8 million in preferred securities. 

Repurchases of Company’s Common Shares: Our Board of Trustees has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we did not repurchase any of our common shares. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 24, 2012, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. Future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives, and the trading price of our common shares.
