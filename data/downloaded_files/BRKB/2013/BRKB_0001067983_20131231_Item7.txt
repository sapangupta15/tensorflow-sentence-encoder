Results of Operations  

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshires corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate tone at the top messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  

Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting in each of the last three years. Periodic earnings from insurance underwriting are significantly impacted by the magnitude of catastrophe loss events occurring during the period. In 2013, we incurred after-tax losses of approximately $285 million from two catastrophe events in Europe. Insurance underwriting earnings in 2012 included after-tax losses of approximately $725 million from Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, underwriting earnings included after-tax losses of approximately $1.7 billion from several different catastrophe events occurring in that year.  

Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses generated significant earnings in each of the last three years. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2013 increased about 14.4% over 2012, which was partially attributable to bolt-on business acquisitions completed during the last two years and reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2012 increased significantly over 2011 due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol), which was completed on September 16, 2011.  

In 2013 and 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $4.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. In each year, after-tax gains included gains from the reductions in estimated liabilities under equity index put option contracts and dispositions of investments, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses. Investment gains in 2013 also included after-tax gains associated with the fair value increases of certain investment securities where the gains or losses were reflected in periodic earnings. In 2012, after-tax investment and derivative gains also included gains from settlements and expirations of credit default contracts. In 2011, after-tax investment and derivative losses were $521 million, reflecting after-tax losses of $1.2 billion related to increases in liabilities under our equity index put option contracts and OTTI losses of $590 million related to certain equity and fixed maturity securities, partially offset by after-tax investment gains of $1.2 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric Preferred Stock investments. We believe that investment and derivatives gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

Managements Discussion (Continued)  

InsuranceUnderwriting  

We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.  

Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income. Underwriting results represent insurance premiums earned less insurance losses, benefits and underwriting expenses incurred.  

The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. For the purpose of this discussion, we considered catastrophe losses significant if the pre-tax losses incurred from a single event (or series of related events such as tornadoes) exceeded $75 million on a consolidated basis. In 2013, we incurred pre-tax losses of $436 million related to two events in Europe. In 2012, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 billion attributable to Hurricane Sandy, which included approximately $490 million incurred by GEICO. In 2011, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $2.6 billion, arising from nine events. The largest losses were from the earthquakes in Japan ($1.25 billion) and New Zealand ($650 million) in the first quarter. Additionally, we incurred losses from several weather related events in the Pacific Rim and the U.S.  

Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. In 2011, we reduced estimated liabilities related to certain retroactive reinsurance contracts which resulted in an increase in pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $875 million. These reductions were primarily due to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liability estimates recorded as of year-end (approximately $65 billion). Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December 31, 2013 may develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, to pre-tax earnings.  

Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Historically, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings has been relatively significant. These gains and losses are included in underwriting expenses.  

A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2013. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.  

Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

GEICO  

Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICOs policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICOs underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Premiums written in 2013 were $19.1 billion, an increase of 11.4% over premiums written in 2012. Premiums earned in 2013 increased approximately $1.8 billion (10.9%) compared to premiums earned in 2012. The growth in premiums written and earned reflected an increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force of 7.8% over the past year and, to a lesser degree, higher average premiums per policy. The increase in policies-in-force reflected a 12.1% increase in voluntary auto new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2013 were approximately 898,000 greater than at December 31, 2012.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2013 increased $1.56 billion (12.2%) compared to 2012. The loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) was 76.7% in 2013 compared to 75.9% in 2012. In 2013, claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages generally increased in the two to four percent range compared to 2012. Physical damage claims severities increased in the three to four percent range in 2013. In addition, average bodily injury claims frequencies increased in the one to two percent range. Bodily injury claims severities increased in the one to three percent range, although severities for personal injury protection coverage declined, primarily in Florida. In both 2013 and 2012, losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred were favorably impacted by reductions of estimates for prior years losses.  

Underwriting expenses incurred in 2013 declined $170 million (5.1%) compared with 2012. Underwriting expenses in 2012 were impacted by a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC). DPAC represents the underwriting costs that are capitalized and expensed as premiums are earned over the policy period. The new accounting standard, which we adopted on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2012, accelerates the timing of when certain underwriting costs are recognized in earnings. We estimate that GEICOs underwriting expenses in 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard. The effect of transitioning to this new accounting standard was completed in 2012. Excluding the effects of the accounting change in 2012, the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned (the expense ratio) in 2013 declined by approximately 0.4 percentage points from 2012.  

Premiums earned in 2012 were approximately $16.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion (9.0%) over 2011. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 9.0% as a result of a 6.5% increase in policies-in-force and an increase in average premium per policy as compared to 2011. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2012 increased slightly compared with 2011. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at December 31, 2012 were approximately 704,000 greater than at December 31, 2011.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2012 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $687 million (5.7%) over 2011. The loss ratio was 75.9% in 2012 and 78.2% in 2011. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2012 included $490 million related to Hurricane Sandy. With the exception of Hurricane Sandy, GEICOs catastrophe losses tend to occur regularly and are normally not individually significant in amount.  

Despite the losses from Hurricane Sandy, our loss ratio declined in 2012 as compared to 2011. Claims frequencies for property damage and collision coverages were down about one percent, comprehensive coverage frequencies were down about ten percent, excluding Hurricane Sandy, and frequencies for bodily injury coverages were relatively unchanged. Physical

 damage severities increased in the two to four percent range and bodily injury severities increased in the one to three percent range from 2011.  

Underwriting expenses incurred in 2012 increased $586 million (21.1%) compared with 2011. The increase was primarily the result of the change in U.S. GAAP concerning DPAC discussed previously. We estimate that GEICOs underwriting expenses in 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard. Based on that estimate, GEICOs expense ratio in 2012 would have been less than in 2011.  

General Re  

Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Res underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Property/casualty  

Property/casualty premiums written in 2013 were relatively unchanged while premiums earned increased $103 million (3.5%), versus the corresponding 2012 period. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and premiums earned in 2013 increased $8 million (0.3%) and $83 million (2.9%), respectively, versus 2012. This was primarily due to increases in European treaty business. Price competition in most property and casualty lines persists. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by declining offers to write business where prices are deemed inadequate. We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve.  

Property/casualty operations in 2013 produced net underwriting gains of $148 million which consisted of $153 million of gains from our property business and $5 million of losses from casualty/workers compensation business. In 2013, property results included catastrophe losses of approximately $400 million attributable to a hailstorm ($280 million) and floods ($120 million) in Europe. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. Property underwriting results also included gains from reductions of $375 million in loss reserve estimates for prior years loss events as a result of lower than expected losses reported from ceding companies. The underwriting loss from casualty/workers compensation business included $141 million of losses attributable to discount accretion related to prior years workers compensation liabilities and net underwriting losses attributable to current year business, offset by reductions in estimated liabilities for prior year losses.  

Premiums written in 2012 increased $72 million (2.5%), while premiums earned declined $37 million (1.3%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written increased $158 million (5.4%) compared to 2011 which reflected increased volume in most of our major markets around the globe. Before the effects of currency exchange, premiums earned in 2012 increased $61 million (2.1%) over 2011 which was primarily attributable to an increase in European property treaty business.  

Underwriting gains were $399 million in 2012 and consisted of $352 million of gains from our property business and $47 million of gains from casualty/workers compensation business. Our property results included $266 million of catastrophe losses primarily attributable to Hurricane Sandy ($226 million), an earthquake in Northern Italy and various tornadoes in the Midwest. The underwriting gains from casualty/workers compensation business included lower than expected losses from prior years

 casualty business, offset in part by discount accretion of workers compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts.  

Underwriting gains were $7 million in 2011 and consisted of a net underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers compensation business substantially offset by a net underwriting loss of $120 million from property business. Our property results in 2011 included $861 million of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses were primarily attributable to earthquakes in New Zealand ($235 million) and Japan ($189 million), as well as several weather related loss events in the United States, Europe and Australia, with losses ranging from about $30 million to $75 million per event. The underwriting gain of $127 million from casualty/workers compensation business reflected overall reductions in loss reserve estimates for prior years loss events, which was partially offset by discount accretion associated with workers compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization.  

Life/health  

In 2013, premiums written decreased $11 million (0.4%), while premiums earned increased $11 million (0.4%) compared with 2012. Adjusting for the effects of currency exchange rate changes, premiums written in 2013 increased $9 million (0.3%) over 2012 and premiums earned were $32 million (1.1%), higher than 2012. The increases, before foreign currency effects, were primarily attributable to increased non-U.S. life business. Life/health operations in 2013 produced net underwriting gains of $135 million, which were driven by lower than expected mortality, offset in part by discount accretion in the long-term care business.  

Premiums written in 2012 increased $93 million (3.2%) and earned premiums increased $91 million (3.2%) from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums written and earned in 2012 increased $239 million (8.2%) and $236 million (8.2%), respectively, compared to 2011. The increases in premiums written and earned were primarily attributed to increased writings in non-U.S. life business. The underwriting results for 2012 were negatively impacted by a premium deficiency reserve that was established on the run off of the U.S. long-term care book of business as well as greater than expected claims frequency and duration in the individual and group disability business in Australia. Underwriting results for 2011 included losses of $15 million attributable to the earthquake in Japan, offset by lower than expected mortality in the life business.  

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  

Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRGs business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary insurance and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Multi-line property/casualty refers to various coverages written on both a quota-share and excess basis and includes a 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (Swiss Re) covering substantially all of Swiss Res property/casualty risks incepting between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. The Swiss Re quota-share contract is now in run-off. BHRGs underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and traditional annuity businesses. BHRGs underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Catastrophe and individual risk premiums written were $807 million in 2013, $785 million in 2012, and $720 million in 2011. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly depending on changes in market conditions and

 managements assessment of the adequacy of premium rates. We have constrained the volume of business written in recent years. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained.  

Periodic underwriting results of our catastrophe and individual risk business are subject to extraordinary volatility, depending on the timing and magnitude of significant catastrophe losses. In 2013, we incurred losses of $20 million from floods in Europe, while in 2012 we incurred losses of $96 million in connection with Hurricane Sandy. In 2011, we incurred losses of approximately $800 million attributable to the earthquakes in Japan ($700 million) and New Zealand ($100 million).  

Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. Coverages are generally subject to policy limits. Premiums earned in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were attributed to a relatively small number of contracts. Premiums earned under retroactive reinsurance contracts in 2011 included approximately $1.7 billion from a reinsurance contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (AIG). Under the contract, we agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIGs U.S. asbestos liabilities. The agreement provides for a maximum limit of indemnification of $3.5 billion.  

Underwriting results attributable to retroactive reinsurance include the recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges that are established with respect to these contracts. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded as the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charge balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses.  

The underwriting losses from retroactive policies of $321 million in 2013 and $201 million in 2012 primarily represented the amortization of deferred charges. In 2013, we increased undiscounted estimated liabilities by approximately $300 million related to prior years contracts, which was partially offset by increases in related deferred charge balances. In 2011, the net underwriting gain from retroactive reinsurance contracts of $645 million reflected the favorable impact of an $865 million reduction in the estimated liabilities related to an adverse loss development contract with Swiss Re, which was attributable to better than expected loss experience.  

Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $17.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, $18.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and $18.8 billion at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 unamortized deferred charges related to BHRGs retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $4.25 billion and $3.90 billion, respectively.  

Premiums earned from multi-line property/casualty business in 2013 declined $958 million (18%) compared to 2012, while premiums earned in 2012 increased approximately $1.1 billion (26%) over 2011. As previously noted, the Swiss Re 20% quota-share contract expired on December 31, 2012. As a result, premiums earned in 2013 from that contract declined $1.9 billion (57%) compared with 2012. Premiums earned under the Swiss Re quota-share contract were $3.4 billion in 2012 and $2.9 billion in 2011. Premiums earned in 2013 from multi-line business, other than from the Swiss Re quota-share contract, increased $981 million (52%) over 2012, which was primarily attributable to increased property quota-share business.  

Multi-line property/casualty generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $655 million in 2013 and $295 million in 2012. This business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $338 million in 2011. Periodic underwriting results can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the changes in the valuation of certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries (including liabilities arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts), which are denominated in foreign currencies.  

Multi-line property/casualty underwriting results in 2013 included losses of $16 million from floods and a hailstorm in Europe. Underwriting results in 2012 included estimated losses of $268 million from Hurricane Sandy. Catastrophe losses were approximately $933 million in 2011, which arose primarily from the earthquakes in Japan ($375 million) and New Zealand ($300 million) and from floods in Thailand ($150 million). The catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2012 arose primarily under the

 Swiss Re quota-share contract. Underwriting results included foreign currency transaction losses of $28 million in 2013 and $123 million in 2012 and gains of $140 million in 2011.  

Life and annuity premiums earned in 2013 increased $476 million (17%) over premiums earned in 2012. In 2013, premiums earned included $1.7 billion received in connection with a new reinsurance contract which provides coverage of guaranteed minimum death benefits on a portfolio of variable annuity reinsurance contracts that have been in run-off for a number of years. Premiums earned in 2013 also included $1.4 billion from traditional annuity insurance and reinsurance contracts that provide for streams of periodic payments in the future in exchange for upfront consideration. Annuity premiums in 2012 were $794 million. These increases were partially offset by the reversal of premiums previously earned (approximately $1.3 billion) under the Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (SRLHA) yearly renewable term life insurance contract as a result of contract amendments in 2013. The amendments essentially commuted coverage with respect to a number of the underlying contracts in exchange for payments to SRLHA of $675 million.  

The life and annuity business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $379 million in 2013. The underwriting gains in 2013 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $255 million attributable to the aforementioned amendments to the SRLHA contract as the reversal of premiums earned was more than offset by the reversal of life benefits incurred. The one-time underwriting gain related to the SRLHA contract partially offset the significant underwriting losses incurred under that contract over the previous three years. Underwriting results in 2013 also included pre-tax gains of approximately $250 million related to the variable annuity guarantee business written in 2013. The gains were primarily attributable to the impact of rising equity markets which lowered estimates of liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. The annuity business normally generates periodic underwriting losses as a result of the periodic accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Periodic underwriting results are also impacted by adjustments for mortality experience and changes in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of the contracts. Annuity business produced net underwriting losses of $178 million in 2013.  

The life and annuity business generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $190 million in 2012 and $700 million in 2011. Annuity business produced net underwriting losses of $159 million in 2012 and $118 million in 2011. In 2011, we also recorded a pre-tax underwriting loss of $642 million with respect to the SRLHA contract. Mortality rates under that contract persistently exceeded the assumptions we made at the inception of the contract. During the fourth quarter of 2011, after considerable internal actuarial analysis, our management concluded that future mortality rates are expected to be greater than our original assumptions. As a result, we increased our estimated liabilities for future policyholder benefits to reflect the new assumptions.  

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  

The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company and Princeton Insurance Company (Princeton, acquired in December 2011), providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Companys primary group, writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired GUARD Insurance Group (GUARD), a provider of workers compensation and complimentary commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses. In the second quarter of 2013, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance which concentrates on providing large scale capacity solutions for commercial property and casualty risks.  

Premiums earned in 2013 by BH Primary aggregated $3,342 million, an increase of $1,079 million (48%) over 2012. Premiums earned in 2012 by BH Primary were $2,263 million, an increase of $514 million (29%) over 2011. The comparative increases in 2013 and 2012 reflected the impact of the GUARD acquisition in 2012 and Princeton at the end of 2011. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies premiums earned increased $301 million in 2013 and $188 million in 2012 compared to the corresponding prior years, due primarily to significantly higher workers compensation insurance volume. BH Primary produced underwriting gains of $385 million in 2013, $286 million in 2012 and $242 million in 2011. The gains reflected a generally favorable claim environment over the three years, which resulted in loss ratios of 60% in 2013, 58% in 2012 and 52% in 2011.

InsuranceInvestment Income  

A summary of net investment income of our insurance operations follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in 2013 increased $259 million (5.8%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to increased dividends earned on equity investments, which reflected increased dividend rates for certain of our larger equity holdings as well as increased overall investments in equity securities.  

Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2013, investment income no longer includes interest from our investments in Wrigley 11.45% subordinated notes ($4.4 billion par), as a result of the repurchase of those notes by Mars/Wrigley. In addition, other higher yielding fixed maturity investments were redeemed in 2013 or will mature in 2014. Investment income in 2014 is expected to decline compared to 2013 given that investment opportunities currently available will likely generate considerably lower yields. We continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalents earning very low yields. However, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents.  

Pre-tax investment income in 2012 declined $271 million (6%) compared to 2011. The decline reflected the redemptions in 2011 of our investments in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries held 87% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and in General Electric 10% Preferred Stock ($3 billion aggregate investment). Dividends earned by our insurance subsidiaries from these investments were $420 million in 2011. Investment income in 2012 reflected dividends earned for the full year from our investment in September 2011 in Bank of America 6% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries hold 80% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock investments.  

Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $77 billion at December 31, 2013, $73 billion at December 31, 2012, and $70 billion at December 31, 2011. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated underwriting gains in each year.  

A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 follows. Other investments include investments in The Dow Chemical Company and Bank of America Corporation. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts are in millions.

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe)  

Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNSF) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. BNSFs major business groups are classified by product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. Earnings of BNSF are summarized below (in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues for 2013 were approximately $22.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion (5.7%) over 2012. The overall year-to-date increase in revenues reflected a 4.5% increase in cars/units handled and a slight increase in average revenue per car/unit, attributable to rates. In 2013, BNSF generated higher revenues from industrial products, consumer products and coal, partially offset by lower revenues from agricultural products.  

In 2013, industrial products revenues of $5.7 billion increased 14% versus 2012, driven by an 11% increase in volume, reflecting significantly higher petroleum products volumes. Consumer products revenues in 2013 were $7.0 billion, an increase of 6% over 2012 that was primarily attributable to volume increases from domestic intermodal business and higher export demand. Coal revenues were $5.0 billion in 2013, an increase of 2.6% over 2012, which was attributable to increased volume. The volume increase reflected increased coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices and reduced utility stockpiles, partially offset by severe weather issues impacting service levels. In 2013, agricultural products revenues of $3.6 billion declined 4% versus 2012 due to volume declines, which were mainly attributable to lower grain exports as a result of the drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012 and strong global competition.

Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) (Continued)  

Revenues (and revenues per car/unit) in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Surcharges vary by product/commodity, and therefore amounts earned in a given period are impacted by business mix and volume as well as fuel costs. Fuel surcharges increased 3% in 2013 as compared to 2012.  

Operating expenses in 2013 were approximately $15.4 billion, an increase of $522 million (3.5%) compared to 2012. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2013 increased $146 million (3.2%) in 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting volume-related cost increases and wage inflation. In 2013, fuel expenses increased $44 million (1%) versus 2012, as the impact of higher volume was partially offset by lower average fuel prices. Purchased services expenses in 2013 increased 2% versus 2012, due primarily to volume-related costs, including purchased transportation for BNSF Logistics LLC, a wholly-owned, third-party logistics business. In 2013, equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $204 million (13%) over 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes, crew travel costs, derailment-related costs and locomotive material expenses in 2013. Interest expense in 2013 increased $106 million (17%) compared to 2012 due to higher average outstanding debt balances.  

Revenues in 2012 were approximately $20.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion (7%) over 2011. Overall, the revenue increase in 2012 reflected higher average revenues per car/unit of approximately 4% as well as a 2% increase in cars/units handled (volume). Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Fuel surcharges in 2012 increased 6% over 2011, and are reflected in average revenue per car/unit.  

The increase in overall volume during 2012 included increases in consumer products (4%) and industrial products (13%), partially offset by declines in coal (6%) and agricultural products (3%). The consumer products volume increase was primarily attributable to higher domestic intermodal and automotive volume. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased shipments of petroleum and construction products. The decline in coal unit volume in 2012 was attributed to lower coal demand as a result of low natural gas prices and high utility stockpiles. Agricultural product volume declined in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting lower wheat and corn shipments for export partially offset by higher soybean and U.S. corn shipments.  

Operating expenses in 2012 increased $588 million (4%) compared to 2011. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2012 increased $190 million (4%) over 2011 due to the increased volume as well as wage inflation, partially offset by increased productivity and lower weather-related costs. Fuel expenses in 2012 increased $192 million (4.5%) due to higher fuel prices and increased volume, partially offset by improved fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency in 2011 was negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. Purchased services costs in 2012 increased $156 million (7%) compared to 2011 due primarily to increased volume, increased purchased transportation services of BNSF Logistics and increased equipment maintenance costs, partially offset by lower weather-related costs. Interest expense in 2012 increased $63 million (11%) versus 2011, due principally to higher average outstanding debt balances.  

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican)  

We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican), which operates an international energy business. MidAmericans domestic regulated utility interests are currently comprised of four companies, PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC), as well as Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company (together, NV Energy). NV Energy was acquired on December 19, 2013. MidAmerican also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. In Great Britain, MidAmerican subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. The rates that our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and franchise network in the United States.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

PacifiCorp operates a regulated utility business in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. PacifiCorps revenues in 2013 were $5.2 billion, an increase of $265 million (5%) compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $337 million, partially offset by lower renewable energy credits ($74 million). The increase in retail revenues reflected higher prices approved by regulators and higher retail customer loads. PacifiCorps earnings before corporate interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2013 were $982 million, an increase of $245 million (33%) compared to 2012. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to charges of $165 million in 2012 related to litigation, fire and other damage claims, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenues. Before the impact of the aforementioned claims, pre-tax earnings in 2013 as a percentage of revenues were relatively unchanged from 2012.  

In 2012, PacifiCorps revenues increased $311 million (7%) over revenues in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $244 million, which were due to higher prices approved by regulators across most of PacifiCorps jurisdictions and to a lesser degree from increased revenues from renewable energy credits. In 2012, PacifiCorp also experienced generally higher customer load in Utah, which was offset by lower industrial customer load in Wyoming and Oregon, attributable to certain large customers electing to self-generate their own power and by lower residential customer load in Oregon as a result of unfavorable weather. EBIT in 2012 declined $34 million (4%) compared to the corresponding 2011 period. EBIT in 2012 was negatively impacted by the aforementioned litigation, fire and other claims ($165 million), which more than offset the increase in operating earnings from higher revenues and otherwise higher operating margins.  

MEC operates a regulated utility business primarily in Iowa and Illinois. MECs revenues in 2013 increased $178 million (5%) over 2012. Revenues in 2013 reflected higher regulated electric and natural gas revenues and lower nonregulated and other revenues. In 2013, regulated retail electric operating revenues increased $82 million, while regulated natural gas revenues increased $165 million compared to 2012. The increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to higher regulatory rates in Iowa and Illinois and increases in retail customer load. The increase in regulated natural gas revenues was primarily due to higher retail volumes and increases in recoveries through adjustment clauses as a result of a higher average per-unit cost of gas sold. Nonregulated and other operating revenues in 2013 declined $67 million in comparison with 2012 due primarily to lower electricity volumes and prices. MECs EBIT in 2013 declined $6 million (3%) compared to 2012. The decline in EBIT was due to lower regulated and nonregulated electric operating earnings, partially offset by higher natural gas earnings.  

MECs revenues in 2012 declined $255 million (7%) compared to 2011, reflecting declines in natural gas revenues of $110 million and nonregulated and other operating revenues of $178 million. In 2012, MECs regulated electric revenues increased 2% to approximately $1.7 billion. The decline in natural gas revenues reflected lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold and lower volumes. The nonregulated and other operating revenues decline was due to generally lower electricity and natural gas prices. MECs EBIT in 2012 declined $43 million (15%) compared to 2011 due primarily to increased depreciation expense of $56 million and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower interest expense.

Utilities and Energy (MidAmerican) (Continued)  

In 2013, natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT were $971 million and $385 million, respectively, which were relatively unchanged from 2012. In 2012, natural gas pipelines revenues and EBIT declined $15 million and $5 million, respectively, compared to 2011. In 2012, natural gas revenues increased from expansion projects and from higher transportation and storage rates in certain markets, which were more than offset by lower volumes of gas sales and the impact of contract expirations. In 2012, EBIT also reflected increased depreciation expense, partially offset by lower interest expense.  

In 2013, Northern Powergrid revenues declined $10 million (1%) compared to 2012. EBIT in 2013 was $362 million, a decline of $67 million versus 2012. EBIT in 2013 was negatively impacted by fourth quarter rebates to customers and higher regulatory rate provisions in 2013, which reduced revenues, and from higher distribution operating expenses and the foreign currency translation effect of a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the U.K. Pound Sterling. Operating expenses in 2013 included increased pension costs and higher depreciation expenses. EBIT in 2013 also included a $9 million loss from the write-off of hydrocarbon well exploration costs.  

Northern Powergrids revenues in 2012 increased $20 million (2%) while EBIT declined $40 million (9%) compared to 2011. In 2012, revenues were negatively impacted by currency-related declines from a stronger U.S. Dollar. Excluding currency related impacts, distribution revenues increased $28 million in 2012, reflecting higher tariff rates ($76 million), partially offset by the impact of higher regulatory provisions in 2011 ($55 million). Northern Powergrids EBIT in 2012 was negatively affected by increases in pension expense ($44 million) and distribution operating expenses ($21 million), which more than offset the increase in distribution revenues.  

Real estate brokerage revenues in 2013 increased $489 million (37%) over 2012, while EBIT increased $57 million (70%) versus 2012. The increases in revenues and EBIT were attributable to increases in closed brokerage transactions and higher average home sales prices from existing business and the impact of businesses acquired during the last two years. Real estate brokerage revenues in 2012 increased $326 million (32%) and EBIT increased $43 million (110%) over 2011. The revenue increase included $123 million from businesses acquired in 2012. The increase in revenues in 2012 also reflected a 16% increase in closed sales transactions and higher average home sale prices from existing businesses. The increase in real estate brokerage EBIT in 2012 reflected the impact of business acquisitions in 2012 as well as the aforementioned increase in closed sales transactions.  

MidAmericans other activities primarily consist of a portfolio of independent power projects, including solar and wind-powered electricity generation projects placed in service in late 2012 and throughout 2013. In 2013, other activities also included the results of NV Energy since the December 19, 2013 acquisition date. The increase in revenues from other activities in 2013 was $81 million, which was primarily attributable to revenues from the new solar and wind-powered facilities, partially offset by the impact of one-time customer refunds issued by NV Energy and impairment losses associated with MidAmericans interests in certain geothermal electricity generation projects. EBIT in 2013 from other activities declined $87 million compared to 2012, as the impacts of the aforementioned losses associated with geothermal projects and NV Energy acquisition costs and customer refunds, more than offset the increase in earnings from the new solar and wind-powered electricity generation projects.  

Corporate interest includes interest on the unsecured debt issued by MidAmerican Energy Holding Company. Corporate interest expense in 2014 is expected to increase compared to recent years as a result of new borrowings in connection with the NV Energy acquisition, including borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries.  

MidAmericans consolidated income tax expense as percentages of pre-tax earnings were 7% in 2013, 9% in 2012 and 18% in 2011. In each year, MidAmericans utility subsidiaries generated significant production tax credits. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid are taxed at lower rates in the U.K. and each year also benefitted from reductions of deferred income taxes as a result of lower enacted corporate income tax rates in the U.K.

A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Marmon  

Through Marmon, we operate approximately 160 manufacturing and service businesses within eleven diverse business sectors that are further organized in three separate companies. Those companies and constituent sectors are:  

  Company    Sector 

 Marmon Engineered Industrial & Metal Components (Engineered Components)   Electrical & Plumbing Products Distribution, Distribution Services, Industrial Products 

 Marmon Natural Resources & Transportation Services (Natural Resources)   Transportation Services & Engineered Products, Engineered Wire & Cable, Crane Services 

 Marmon Retail & End User Technologies (Retail Technologies)   Highway Technologies, Water Treatment, Retail Store Fixtures, Food Service Equipment, Retail Home Improvement Products  

Marmons consolidated revenues in 2013 were approximately $7.0 billion, 2.7% below 2012, with almost 60% of the decline associated with metals price deflation. Consolidated pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% over 2012. Pre-tax earnings in 2013 as a percentage of revenues was 16.9% in 2013 compared with 15.9% in 2012. This margin improvement is a direct result of Marmons focus on niche products/markets, product/service innovation and improvement in operating efficiency and productivity. The pre-tax earnings information in the paragraphs that follow, exclude unallocated corporate expenses of $30 million in 2013 and $34 million in 2012.  

Engineered Components 2013 revenues were $2.3 billion, a decline of 5% as compared to 2012. The revenue decline was primarily due to the impact of lower metals (steel and copper) costs, which are passed on to customers with minimal margin, as well as reductions in volume in Distribution Services, partially offset by increased volume in the Industrial Products sector. Engineered Components pre-tax earnings were $204 million in 2013, representing a decline of 4% from earnings in 2012. The decline in pre-tax earnings in 2013 reflected reduced margins in the Distribution Services sector, attributable to lower sales volumes and steel price reductions. Electrical & Plumbing Products sector 2013 pre-tax earnings increased over 2012, despite lower revenues. Restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2013 have provided the impetus for improved pre-tax earnings in this sector. Industrial Products sector pre-tax earnings increase in 2013 over 2012 was driven by higher volumes and improved product mix.  

Natural Resources revenues were $2.5 billion in 2013, a decline of 3% compared to 2012. The decrease in revenues was attributable to several non-recurring large prior year projects in the Transportation Services & Engineered Products (TSEP) and Engineered Wire and Cable sectors and lower revenues from external tank car sales, partially offset by higher rail leasing revenues attributable to higher lease rates and new tank car fleet additions. Natural Resources pre-tax earnings were $718 million in 2013, an increase of 3% over 2012. Earnings in 2013 reflected higher rail leasing rates and new tank car fleet

 additions which more than offset the prior year higher project revenues, higher railcar repair costs and lower sales volume of external tank cars.  

Retail Technologies revenues were $2.2 billion in 2013, unchanged from 2012. Revenues increased in 2013 in Highway Technologies driven by growth in the automotive clutch and heavy duty truck axle businesses, Retail Store Fixtures, as a result of a significant store fixture display product rollout for a key customer and Water Treatment, driven by growth in residential products. These revenue increases were offset by a revenue decrease at Retail Home Improvement Products due to a planned reduction in revenues from lower margin products. Retail Technologies pre-tax earnings in 2013 were $284 million which represented an increase of 8% over 2012. The pre-tax earnings increases were primarily due to revenue growth in the Highway Technologies, Retail Store Fixtures and Water Treatment sectors, as well as cost savings related to 2012 restructuring actions taken in the Retail Store Fixtures sector.  

Marmons consolidated revenues in 2012 were $7.2 billion, an increase of 3.6% over 2011. Consolidated pre-tax earnings were $1.1 billion in 2012, an increase of 14.6% over 2011. In 2012 pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 15.9% compared to 14.3% in 2011.  

Engineered Components 2012 revenues were $2.4 billion, a decline of 2% as compared to 2011. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower volume and copper pricing in the Electrical & Plumbing Products sector driven by lower HVAC demand and continued softness in commercial construction in 2012, offset in part by a 2012 bolt-on acquisition and increased market share in certain market niches in the Distribution Services sector. Engineered Components pre-tax earnings were $214 million, an increase of 3% from 2011. The increase in pre-tax earnings in 2012 reflected the growth in market share and higher margins in the Distribution Services sector, partially offset by the revenue declines in the Electrical & Plumbing Products sector.  

Natural Resources revenues were $2.6 billion in 2012, an increase of 10% compared to 2011. The increase in revenues was attributable to bolt-on acquisitions in the Crane Services and Engineered Wire & Cable sectors in 2012 and growth in the TSEP sector. Higher rail fleet utilization and higher lease rates, offset in part by lower external tank car sales provided most of TSEPs growth, with sulfur equipment installations in the Middle East providing the balance. Natural Resources pre-tax earnings were $695 million in 2012, an increase of 23% from earnings in 2011. Earnings in 2012 reflected the impact of the aforementioned bolt-on acquisitions, higher rail fleet utilization and lease rates and Middle East projects, as well cost savings relating to restructuring actions taken in 2011 in the Engineered Wire & Cable sector.  

Retail Technologies revenues were $2.2 billion in 2012, an increase of 3% compared to 2011. The 2012 revenue increase is due to the full year impact of a bolt-on acquisition made in December 2011 and growth in Highway Technologies commercial and heavy haul trailer products along with increased growth in projects for the Canadian Tar Sands area in the Water Treatment sector. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the Retail Store Fixtures sector due to reduced volume from its major customer, which resulted in a 14% decline in revenues. Retail Technologies pre-tax 2012 earnings were $262 million which represented an increase of 3% over 2011. The pre-tax earnings increase was primarily due to revenue growth in the Highway Technologies and Water Treatment sectors offset in part by the decline in the Retail Store Fixtures sector previously discussed.  

McLane Company  

Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. Through its subsidiaries, McLane also operates as a wholesale distributor of distilled spirits, wine and beer. On August 24, 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (MBM). MBM, based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, is a large customized foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains with annual revenues of approximately $6 billion. MBMs revenues and earnings are included in McLanes results beginning as of the acquisition date. McLanes grocery and foodservice businesses are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLanes significant customers include Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. Approximately 25% of McLanes consolidated revenues in 2013 were attributable to Wal-Mart. A curtailment of purchasing by Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLanes periodic revenues and earnings.

McLane Company (Continued)  

McLanes revenues in 2013 were approximately $45.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately $8.5 billion (22.7%) over revenues in 2012. The increase in revenues in 2013 reflected the impact of MBM, as well as year-to-date revenue increases ranging from 10% to 15% in the grocery, other foodservice and beverage businesses. Revenues of each of these businesses in 2013 included the impact of new customers added over the past two years. McLanes pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $83 million (20.6%) over earnings in 2012. The increase in 2013 pre-tax earnings reflected the increases in revenues, including the impact of the MBM acquisition, and a gain from the sale of its Brazil-based logistics business, partially offset by slightly lower operating margins.  

McLanes revenues were approximately $37.4 billion in 2012, an increase of about $4.2 billion (12.5%) over 2011. The increase in revenues was attributable to the MBM acquisition, as well as 6% to 8% revenue increases in McLanes grocery, foodservice and beverage business units. The increases in grocery and foodservice revenues reflected manufacturer price increases as well as increased volume. Pre-tax earnings in 2012 were $403 million, an increase of $33 million (9%) over 2011. The overall increase in earnings reflected the increases in revenues as pre-tax margin rates were relatively unchanged.  

Other manufacturing  

Our other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands womens intimate apparel). Also included in this group are Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol), a specialty chemical manufacturer that we acquired on September 16, 2011, IMC International Metalworking Companies (Iscar), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide, Forest River, a leading manufacturer of leisure vehicles and CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries.  

Other manufacturing revenues in 2013 increased $2.3 billion (8.7%) to $29.1 billion. Forest River generated revenues of $3.3 billion in 2013, a 24% increase over 2012. The increase reflected a 17% volume increase and higher average sales prices, attributable to price and product mix changes. Revenues in 2013 from our building products businesses increased 8% to about $9.6 billion. These businesses benefitted from the generally improved residential and commercial construction markets. Apparel revenues in 2013 increased 3.5% to about $4.3 billion. Our other businesses in this group produced revenues in 2013 of $11.9 billion in the aggregate, an increase of about 8% over 2012. Most of the increase in revenues of these other businesses was attributable to bolt-on acquisitions during the last two years.  

Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2013 were $3.6 billion, an increase of $289 million (8.7%) versus 2012. Increased earnings were generated by Forest River (32%), building products businesses (13%) and apparel businesses (25%) compared to 2012. Pre-tax earnings of Iscar and Lubrizol were roughly unchanged from 2012. In addition, bolt-on acquisitions during the last two years contributed to the overall increased earnings.  

Revenues of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 were approximately $26.8 billion, an increase of approximately $5.6 billion (26%) over 2011. Excluding Lubrizol, revenues in 2012 grew 6% over 2011. Revenues of Forest River increased 27%, which was attributable to increased volume and average sales prices. Revenues from building products and apparel businesses increased 4% and 5%, respectively, as compared with 2011. However, revenues of Iscar and CTB (before the impact of bolt-on acquisitions) declined compared to 2011 as a result of weakness in demand, particularly in non-U.S. markets.  

Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses were approximately $3.3 billion in 2012, an increase of $922 million (38%) over earnings in 2011. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 increased 6% compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings from building products, apparel and Forest River, partially offset by lower earnings from Iscar, CTB and Scott Fetzer. In 2012, our Shaw carpet and flooring business benefited from the impact of price increases at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, as well as from relatively stable raw material costs, which resulted in higher margins. Our apparel businesses benefitted from past pricing actions and stabilizing raw material costs. On the other hand, our other businesses that manufacture products that are primarily for commercial and industrial customers, particularly those with significant business in overseas markets, such as CTB and Iscar, were negatively impacted in 2012 by slowing economic conditions in certain of those markets.

Other service  

Our other service businesses include NetJets, the worlds leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI, a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,300 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; the Buffalo News; the BH Media Group (BH Media), which includes the Omaha World-Herald, as well as 29 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.  

Revenues of our other service businesses in 2013 were $9.0 billion, an increase of $821 million (10%) over revenues in 2012. In 2013, revenues of NetJets increased $288 million (7.5%), driven by higher sales of fractional aircraft shares, while TTIs revenues increased $255 million (11%) over 2012. Revenues of BH Media increased $207 million (66%), attributable to the impact of business acquisitions during the last two years. Pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion in 2013 increased $130 million (13%) compared to 2012. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to BH Media, FlightSafety, TTI and NetJets. The earnings increase of BH Media was due to bolt-on acquisitions during the last two years. TTIs earnings increased 10% in 2013 versus 2012, due to higher sales and changes in product mix. TTI continues to be impacted by price competition, which pressures overall gross sales margins. FlightSafetys earnings increased 11% in 2013, reflecting increased training revenues and relatively unchanged operating expenses. In 2013, NetJets earnings increased 7% as improved flight operations margins, fractional sales margins and reduced net financing costs more than offset the increase in comparative aircraft value impairment charges.  

Revenues of our other service businesses in 2012 were approximately $8.2 billion, an increase of $737 million (10%) over 2011. The increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the BH Media Group and a comparative revenue increase from TTI, principally due to its bolt-on business acquisitions in 2012. Pre-tax earnings of $966 million in 2012 declined $11 million (1%) from earnings in 2011. Earnings of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011. Earnings of other service businesses in 2012 included earnings of the BH Media Group, which were more than offset by lower earnings from TTI due primarily to weaker customer demand and intensifying price competition over the past year.  

Retailing  

Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), Sees Candies; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; and Oriental Trading Company (OTC), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties, which we acquired on November 27, 2012.  

Revenues of our retailing businesses in 2013 were $4.3 billion, an increase of $573 million (15%) over 2012. Pre-tax earnings in 2013 of these businesses increased $70 million (23%) as compared to earnings in 2012. The comparative increases in revenues and earnings were primarily attributable to the inclusion of OTC for the full year in 2013. Otherwise, earnings of the home furnishings and jewelry retail groups increased in 2013, while earnings of Pampered Chef and Sees Candies declined.  

Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2012 from the retailing businesses increased $142 million (4%) and $5 million (2%), respectively, over revenues and earnings in 2011. Increased revenues from the home furnishings and jewelry businesses as well as the inclusion of OTC from its acquisition date were partially offset by lower revenues from Pampered Chef. Increased earnings of our home furnishings retailers were substantially offset by lower earnings from our jewelry businesses and Pampered Chef.

Finance and Financial Products  

Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment leasing (XTRA), furniture leasing (CORT) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Clayton Homes revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2013 increased $185 million (6%) and $161 million (63%), respectively, compared to 2012. In 2013, Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings benefitted from increased home sales, lower loan loss provisions and an increase in net interest income, as lower interest expense more than offset reductions in interest income on loan portfolios. Home unit sales increased 9% in 2013. Loan loss provisions in 2013 were lower reflecting comparatively lower foreclosures volume and loss rates. Clayton Homes manufactured housing business continues to operate at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single family housing markets, which receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. Government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Nevertheless, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions.  

Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings in 2012 increased $101 million (66%) over earnings in 2011. Earnings in 2012 were impacted by the increased unit sales, which improved manufacturing and other operating efficiencies. Earnings also benefited from reduced insurance claims and a decline in credit losses. The decline in interest income on loan portfolios was more than offset by interest expense attributable to a decline in borrowings and lower interest rates.  

Pre-tax earnings of CORT and XTRA in 2013 increased $17 million (11%) to $165 million, as compared to 2012. The increase reflected increased lease revenues and earnings of XTRA, which benefitted from increases in working units and average rental rates, relatively stable operating expenses and a foreign currency related gain in 2013.  

Pre-tax earnings of CORT and XTRA in 2012 were $148 million, a decline of $7 million (5%) versus 2011. In 2012, CORTs earnings increased over 2011 due to a 5% increase in rental income and relatively stable selling, general and administrative expenses, which improved operating margins. In 2012, earnings from XTRA declined primarily due to increased depreciation expense and lower foreign currency exchange gains.  

Other earnings include interest and dividends from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments and our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business in which we own a 50% interest. Other earnings previously included interest income from a relatively small number of long-held commercial real estate loans. These loans were repaid in full during the third and fourth quarters of 2012. In addition, other earnings includes income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to fund loans to Clayton Homes and from guaranty fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes and NetJets results. Guaranty fees charged to NetJets were $11 million in 2013, $30 million in 2012 and $41 million in 2011 and interest spreads charged to Clayton Homes were $78 million in 2013, $90 million in 2012 and $100 million in 2011.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses  

A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  

We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings.  

Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2013 were $4,065 million. Investment gains in 2013 included approximately $2.1 billion related to our investments in General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock warrants and Wrigley subordinated notes. Beginning in 2013, the unrealized gains or losses associated with the warrants were included in earnings. These warrants were exercised in October 2013 on a cashless basis in exchange for shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $2.4 billion. The Wrigley subordinated notes were repurchased for cash of $5.08 billion, resulting in a pre-tax investment gain of $680 million. Pre-tax investment gains were approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 and were primarily attributable to sales of equity securities. Investment gains in 2011 included aggregate pre-tax gains of $1.8 billion from the redemptions of our Goldman Sachs and General Electric preferred stock investments.  

In each of the three years ending December 31, 2013, we recognized OTTI losses on certain of our equity and fixed maturity investments. OTTI losses on fixed maturity investments were $228 million in 2013, $337 million in 2012 and $402 million in 2011, and substantially all of the losses related to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings (TCEH) bonds. In 2011, we also recognized aggregate OTTI losses of $506 million related to our investments in equity securities, a portion of which related to certain components of our Wells Fargo common stock investments. The OTTI losses on equity securities in 2011 averaged about 7.5% of the original cost of the impaired securities. In each case, the issuer had been profitable in recent periods and in some cases highly profitable.  

Although we have periodically recorded OTTI losses in earnings in each of the past three years, we continue to own certain of these securities. In cases where the market values of these investments have increased since the dates the OTTI losses were recorded in earnings, these increases are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders equity as a  

48

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)  

 component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI losses have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  

As of December 31, 2013, consolidated gross unrealized losses on our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were $289 million. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2013, such losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline.  

Derivative gains/losses primarily represent the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets.  

In 2013, our equity index put option contracts generated a pre-tax gain of $2.8 billion, which was due to changes in fair values of the contracts as a result of overall higher equity index values, favorable currency movements and modestly higher interest rate assumptions. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates. As of December 31, 2013, the intrinsic value of these contracts was approximately $1.7 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $4.7 billion.  

In 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains from our equity index put option contracts of approximately $1.0 billion. These gains were due to increased index values, foreign currency exchange rate changes and valuation adjustments on a small number of contracts where contractual settlements are determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value, partially offset by lower interest rate assumptions. In 2011, we recorded pre-tax losses of approximately $1.8 billion on our equity index put option contracts. The losses reflected declines ranging from about 5.5% to 17% with respect to three of the four equity indexes covered under our contracts and lower interest rate assumptions.  

Our credit default contracts generated pre-tax losses of $213 million in 2013, which was due to increases in estimated liabilities of a municipality issuer contract that relates to more than 500 municipal debt issues. Our credit default contract exposures associated with corporate issuers expired in December 2013. There were no losses paid in 2013. Our remaining credit default derivative contract exposures are currently limited to the municipality issuer contract.  

In 2012, we recognized pre-tax gains of $894 million on credit default contracts. Such gains were attributable to narrower spreads and reduced time exposure, as well as from settlements related to the termination of certain contracts. We recorded pre-tax losses of $251 million on our credit default contracts in 2011. The losses in 2011 were primarily related to our contracts involving non-investment grade corporate issuers due to widening credit default spreads and loss events. In 2012 and 2011, credit loss payments were $68 million and $86 million, respectively.  

Financial Condition  

Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2013 was $221.9 billion, an increase of $34.24 billion since the beginning of the year. Our consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2013 is net of a reduction of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of acquisitions of noncontrolling interests as discussed below and in Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Consolidated cash and investments of our insurance and other businesses approximated $199.2 billion (excludes our investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation) at December 31, 2013, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.6 billion. As of December 31, 2013, our insurance subsidiaries held approximately $186.8 billion in cash and investments.

Financial Condition (Continued)  

In 2013, we used cash of approximately $15 billion in the aggregate to fund Berkshires investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (Heinz Holding) and to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries. On June 7, 2013, we invested $12.25 billion in Heinz Holding which acquired H.J. Heinz Company. Our investments in Heinz Holding consist of common stock, common stock warrants and preferred stock. Berkshire currently holds 50% of the voting interests in Heinz Holding. During 2013, Berkshire acquired noncontrolling interests of Marmon and International Metalworking Companies B.V., the parent company of Iscar. Cash paid in 2013 in connection with these acquisitions was approximately $2.9 billion and an additional $1.2 billion is payable in March 2014.  

On October 1, 2013, we received cash of approximately $5.1 billion in connection with Mars/Wrigleys repurchase of our investment in Wrigley subordinated notes. In January 2013, Berkshire issued $2.6 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2043. The proceeds were used to fund the repayment of $2.6 billion of notes that matured in February 2013. On January 1, 2014, Marmon completed its acquisition of the beverage dispensing and merchandising operations of British engineering company IMI plc for approximately $1.1 billion. The acquisition was funded with existing cash balances.  

Berkshires Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at managements discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B common shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshires consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases during 2013. In December 2012, Berkshire acquired 9,475 Class A shares and 606,499 Class B shares for approximately $1.3 billion.  

On December 19, 2013, MidAmerican completed its acquisition of NV Energy, Inc. (NV Energy), an energy holding company serving electric and natural gas customers in Nevada. MidAmerican purchased all outstanding shares of NV Energys common stock for cash of approximately $5.6 billion. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash provided by MidAmericans shareholders of $3.6 billion (including approximately $3.5 billion provided by Berkshire) and the issuance by MidAmerican of $2.0 billion of senior unsecured debt.  

Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2013, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were $8.2 billion, including $4.3 billion by MidAmerican and $3.9 billion by BNSF. BNSF and MidAmerican have forecasted aggregate capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $11.1 billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2013, BNSF issued $3.0 billion in new debentures consisting of $1.5 billion of debentures due in 2023 and $1.5 billion of debentures due in 2043. BNSFs outstanding debt was approximately $17.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. In 2013, MidAmerican and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $4.5 billion, including the new senior unsecured debt issued in funding the NV Energy acquisition, and repaid borrowings of approximately $2.0 billion. MidAmericans aggregate outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2013 were approximately $29.6 billion which includes approximately $5.3 billion of NV Energys debt. BNSF and MidAmerican have aggregate debt and capital lease maturities in 2014 of $2.1 billion. Berkshires commitment to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund its regulated utility subsidiaries expired on February 28, 2014 and has not been renewed. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries.  

Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity and equity investments, were approximately $26.2 billion and $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Liabilities were $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $22.1 billion as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, notes payable and other borrowings of finance and financial products businesses were $12.7 billion and included approximately $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC). During 2013, BHFC issued $3.45 billion aggregate of new senior notes and repaid $3.45 billion of maturing senior notes. In January 2014, an additional $750 million of BHFC debt matured and was refinanced with a corresponding amount of new debt. We currently intend to issue additional new debt through BHFC to replace some or all of its upcoming debt maturities. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated loans and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire.

Financial Condition (Continued)  

As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are party to equity index put option and credit default contracts. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshires credit ratings. At December 31, 2013, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $5.3 billion and we had no collateral posting requirements.  

We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations.  

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act) was signed into law. The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are expected to be finalized during the next several months. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.  

Contractual Obligations  

We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases, that are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided. Amounts due as of the balance sheet date for purchases where the goods and services have been received and a liability incurred are not included in the following table to the extent that such amounts are due within one year of the balance sheet date.  

The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of payments arising under property and casualty insurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events that may occur over many years. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are estimated based on assumptions as to future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. The amounts presented in the following table are based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts, receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table below. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 follows. Amounts are in millions.

Critical Accounting Policies  

Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements, with the benefit of hindsight, will likely be adjusted in the future based on additional information made available and changes in other facts and circumstances.  

Property and casualty losses  

A summary of our consolidated liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses is presented in the table below. Except for certain workers compensation liabilities, all liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses (referred to in this section as gross unpaid losses) are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value, regardless of the length of the claim-tail. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effects.  

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts with respect to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of loss payments is subject to a great degree of variability and is contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and cedants and the determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process. A variety of techniques are used in establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses. Regardless of the techniques used, significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future. As a result, uncertainties are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving techniques and processes used.  

As of any balance sheet date, not all claims that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claims have been settled. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include provisions for reported claims (referred to as case reserves) and for claims that have not been reported (referred to as incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves). The time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to as the claim-tail. Property claims usually have fairly short claim-tails and, absent litigation, are reported and settled within a few years of occurrence. Casualty losses usually have very long claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails.  

Receivables are recorded with respect to losses ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses. In addition, reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders.  

We utilize processes and techniques to establish liability estimates that are believed to best fit the particular business. Additional information regarding those processes and techniques of our significant insurance businesses (GEICO, General Re and BHRG) follows.  

GEICO  

GEICOs gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities as of December 31, 2013 were $11.3 billion, which included $8.0 billion of reported average, case and case development reserves and $3.3 billion of IBNR reserves. GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. Auto insurance claims generally have a relatively short claim-tail. The  

52

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

GEICO (Continued)  

 key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (frequency) and average loss per claim (severity).  

Our reserving methodologies produce reserve estimates based upon the individual claims (or a ground-up approach), which yields an aggregate estimate of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Ranges of loss estimates are not determined in the aggregate.  

Our actuaries establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserves using recognized standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The significant reserve components (and percentage of gross reserves as of December 31, 2013) are: (1) average reserves (15%), (2) case and case development reserves (60%) and (3) IBNR reserves (25%). Each component of loss reserves is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claims. Reserves are analyzed using statistical techniques on historical claims data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Data is analyzed by policy coverage, rated state, reporting date and occurrence date, among other ways. A brief discussion of each reserve component follows.  

We establish average reserve amounts for reported auto damage claims and new liability claims prior to the development of an individual case reserve. The average reserves are intended to represent a reasonable estimate for incurred claims for claims when adjusters have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid within a relatively short time after being reported. Average reserve amounts are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claims opened.  

Our claims adjusters generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates as soon as the specific facts and merits of each claim can be evaluated. Case reserves represent the amounts that in the judgment of the adjusters are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim, including expenses. Individual case reserves are revised over time as more information becomes known.  

For most liability coverages, case reserves alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim-tail, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts available at the time the case reserve is established. Therefore, we establish additional case development reserve estimates, which are usually percentages of the case reserve. As of December 31, 2013, case development reserves averaged approximately 25% of total established case reserves. In general, case development factors are selected by a retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserves. Case development factors are reviewed and revised periodically.  

For unreported claims, IBNR reserve estimates are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim counts to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by accident quarter. Reported claims are subtracted from the ultimate claim projections to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claims. The number of unreported claims is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the IBNR reserve amount. Actuarial techniques are difficult to apply reliably in certain situations, such as to new legal precedents, class action suits or recent catastrophes. Consequently, supplemental IBNR reserves for these types of events may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial, claims and other management personnel.  

For each significant coverage, we test the adequacy of the total loss reserves using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, paid loss triangles and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.  

Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimates recorded at the end of 2012 developed downward by $238 million when reevaluated through December 31, 2013, producing a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2013. These downward reserve developments represented approximately 1.3% of earned premiums in 2013 and approximately 2.3% of prior year-end recorded liabilities. Reserving assumptions at December 31, 2013 were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

GEICO (Continued)  

Within the automobile line of business, reserves for liability coverages are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails. Approximately 92% of GEICOs reserves as of December 31, 2013 were for automobile liability, of which bodily injury (BI) coverage accounted for approximately 55%. We believe it is reasonably possible that the average BI severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used. If actual BI severity changes one percentage point from what was used in establishing the reserves, our reserves would develop up or down by approximately $165 million resulting in a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.  

GEICOs exposure to highly uncertain losses is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policies written during a period from 1981 to 1984. Remaining liabilities associated with such exposure are currently a relatively insignificant component of GEICOs total reserves (approximately 1.3%) and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure. Related claim activity over the past year was insignificant.  

General Re and BHRG  

Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of our General Re and BHRG underwriting units derive primarily from assumed reinsurance. Additional uncertainties are unique to the processes used in estimating such reinsurance liabilities. The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices) and other factors. Contract terms, conditions and coverages tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policies. We are unable to reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties.  

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative, per occurrence excess or retroactive contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. This occurs when our personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information related to aggregate excess-of-loss contracts, including catastrophe losses and quota-share treaties, is often less detailed. Occasionally, loss information is reported in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data is usually provided through periodic reports and may include the amount of ceded losses paid where reimbursement is sought as well as case loss reserve estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers.  

Each of our reinsurance businesses has established practices to identify and gather needed information from clients. These practices include, for example, comparison of expected premiums to reported premiums to help identify delinquent client reports and claim reviews to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting. We periodically evaluate and modify these practices as conditions, risk factors and unanticipated areas of exposures are identified.  

The timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurers. In some instances, multiple reinsurers assume and cede parts of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured. In these instances, the claim reporting delays are compounded. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and other factors. Contracts covering casualty losses on a per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delays in reporting due to the length of the claim-tail as regards to the underlying claim. In addition, ceding companies may not report claims until they conclude it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected, usually determined as a function of its estimate of the claim amount as a percentage of the reinsurance contract retention. However, the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property losses or property catastrophe losses may not vary significantly from primary insurance.  

Under contracts where periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies, such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals which in the U.S. range from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices vary. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. The different client reporting practices generally do not result in a significant increase in risk or uncertainty as the actuarial reserving methodologies are adjusted to compensate for the delays.  

Premium and loss data is provided to us through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data provided is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. Information provided by ceding

 companies is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, we are permitted under the contracts to access the cedants books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing us the ability to conduct audits to determine the accuracy and completeness of information. Audits are conducted as we deem appropriate.  

In the normal course of business, disputes with clients occasionally arise concerning whether certain claims are covered under our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through the involvement of our claims department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally specify whether arbitration, litigation, or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  

General Re  

General Res gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and gross reserves by major line of business as of December 31, 2013 are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

General Res loss reserve estimation process is based upon a ground-up approach, beginning with case estimates and supplemented by additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR reserves. The critical processes in establishing loss reserves involve the establishment of ACRs by claim examiners, the determination of expected ultimate loss ratios which drive IBNR reserve amounts and the comparison of case reserve reporting trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded reserve amounts are subject to tail risk where reported losses develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period.  

We do not routinely determine loss reserve ranges. We believe that the techniques necessary to make such determinations have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumptions required render such resulting ranges to be unreliable. In addition, claim counts or average amounts per claim are not utilized because clients do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail.  

Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, our claim examiners make independent evaluations of loss amounts. In some cases, examiners estimates differ from amounts reported by ceding companies. If the examiners estimates are significantly greater than the ceding companys estimates, the claims are further investigated. If deemed appropriate, ACRs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company. As of December 31, 2013, ACRs aggregated approximately $2.2 billion before discounts and were concentrated in workers compensation reserves, and to a lesser extent in professional liability reserves. Our examiners also periodically conduct detailed claim reviews of individual clients and case reserves are often increased as a result. In 2013, we conducted 266 claim reviews.  

Our actuaries classify all loss and premium data into segments (reserve cells) primarily based on product (e.g., treaty, facultative and program) and line of business (e.g., auto liability, property, etc.). For each reserve cell, premiums and losses are aggregated by accident year, policy year or underwriting year (depending on client reporting practices) and analyzed over time. We internally refer to these loss aggregations as loss triangles, which serve as the primary basis for our IBNR reserve calculations. We review over 300 reserve cells for our North American business and approximately 900 reserve cells with respect to our international business.

General Re (Continued)  

We use loss triangles to determine the expected case loss emergence patterns for most coverages and, in conjunction with expected loss ratios by accident year, loss triangles are further used to determine IBNR reserves. While additional calculations form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern, the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly a mechanical process. In instances where the historical loss data is insufficient, we use estimation formulas along with reliance on other loss triangles and judgment. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include but are not limited to the following: changes in client claims practices, changes in claim examiners use of ACRs or the frequency of client company claim reviews, changes in policy terms and coverage (such as client loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), changes in loss trends and changes in legal trends that result in unanticipated losses, as well as other sources of statistical variability. Collectively, these factors influence the selection of the expected loss emergence patterns.  

We select expected loss ratios by reserve cell, by accident year, based upon reviewing forecasted losses and indicated ultimate loss ratios that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premium. If the selected emergence pattern is not accurate, then the indicated ultimate loss ratios may not be accurate, which can affect the selected loss ratios and hence the IBNR reserve. As with selected loss emergence patterns, selecting expected loss ratios is not a strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratios and department pricing loss ratios.  

We estimate IBNR reserves by reserve cell, by accident year, using the expected loss emergence patterns and the expected loss ratios. The expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical IBNR reserving assumptions and are updated annually. Once the annual IBNR reserves are determined, our actuaries calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year. These calculations do not involve new assumptions and use the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. The expected losses are then allocated into interim estimates that are compared to actual reported losses in the subsequent year. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR reserves and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR reserve assumptions during the course of the year.  

In 2013, our reported claims for prior years workers compensation losses were less than expected by $238 million. However, further analysis of the workers compensation reserve cells by segment indicated the need for maintaining IBNR reserves. These developments precipitated a net increase of $112 million in nominal IBNR reserve estimates for unreported occurrences. After adjusting for the $126 million net increase in liabilities from changes in net reserve discounts during the year, the net increase in workers compensation losses from prior years occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings in 2013. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios for our significant excess-of-loss workers compensation reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2013 of approximately $795 million and $441 million on a discounted basis. The increase in discounted reserves would produce a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Our other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) developed favorably in 2013 relative to expectations. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given year means that loss reserve amounts currently established will continue to develop favorably. For our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cells (including medical malpractice, umbrella, auto and general liability), an increase of five points in the tails of the expected emergence patterns and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratios (one percent for large international proportional reserve cells) would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $978 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cells. However, given the diversification in worldwide business, more likely outcomes are believed to be less than $978 million.  

In 2013, our property results included estimated losses incurred of $400 million from significant catastrophe events during the year. In 2013, reported claims for prior years property loss events were less than expected, and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $375 million. However, the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophes and large individual property losses.

General Re (Continued)  

In certain reserve cells within excess directors and officers and errors and omissions (D&O and E&O) coverages, IBNR reserves are based on estimated ultimate losses without consideration of expected emergence patterns. These cells often involve a spike in loss activity arising from recent industry developments making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern. For our large D&O and E&O reserve cells, an increase of ten points in the tail of the expected emergence pattern (for those cells where emergence patterns are considered) and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in nominal IBNR reserves and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $153 million. We believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios to increase at these rates.  

Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as in setting the estimates for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, mass tort) claims. Gross unpaid mass tort liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively and net of reinsurance, were approximately $1.2 billion at the end of each of the last two years. Mass tort net claims paid were $72 million in 2013. In 2013, ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims were increased by $30 million. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider survival ratios based on average net claim payments in recent years versus net unpaid losses as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. The survival ratio based on claim payments made over the last three years was approximately 15.6 years as of December 31, 2013. The reinsurance industrys survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserves was approximately 14.5 years based on the three years ending December 31, 2012. Estimating mass tort losses is very difficult due to the changing legal environment. Although such reserves are believed to be adequate, significant reserve increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.  

BHRG  

BHRGs unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2013 are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In general, the methodologies we use to establish loss reserves vary widely and encompass many of the common methodologies employed in the actuarial field today. Certain traditional methodologies such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques where appropriate. Additional judgments must also be employed to consider changes in contract conditions and terms as well as the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change.  

Our gross loss reserves related to retroactive reinsurance policies were predominately for casualty or liability losses. Our retroactive policies relate to loss events occurring before a specified date on or before the contract date and include excess-of-loss contracts, in which losses above a contractual retention are indemnified or contracts that indemnify all losses paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date. We paid retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in 2013. The classification reported case reserves has no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policies since the amount is often derived from reports in bulk from ceding companies, who may have inconsistent definitions of case reserves. We review and establish loss reserve estimates, including estimates of IBNR reserves, in the aggregate by contract. In 2013, we increased reserves for prior years retroactive reinsurance contracts by approximately $300 million, which related primarily to asbestos and environmental risks assumed.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)  

BHRG (Continued)  

In establishing retroactive reinsurance reserves, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. The claim-tail is expected to be very long for many policies and may last several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the claim-tail is expected to be very long for such contracts, we reassess expected ultimate losses as significant events related to the underlying losses are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process.  

BHRGs liabilities for environmental, asbestos and latent injury losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $11.9 billion at December 31, 2013 and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contracts. We paid losses of approximately $874 million in 2013 attributable to these exposures. BHRG, as a reinsurer, does not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line treaty or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a ground-up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, our estimates can only be developed by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claims will be adjudicated. Potential legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims in the future.  

We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed approximately $35 billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also believe it unlikely that our reported year end gross unpaid losses of $17.7 billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15%.  

Certain of our reinsurance contracts are expected to have a low frequency of claim occurrence combined with a potential for high severity of claims, such as property losses from catastrophes and aviation risks related to our catastrophe and individual risk business. Loss reserves related to catastrophe and individual risk contracts were approximately $800 million at December 31, 2013. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years events were reduced by about $200 million in 2013, which produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. Absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage terms, the expected claim-tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimates usually emerges within 24 months after the loss event.  

Other reinsurance reserves (approximately $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2013) consisted of a variety of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Liabilities as of December 31, 2013, included approximately $4.0 billion related to the 20% quota-share contract with Swiss Re, which is now in run-off. Reinsurance reserve amounts are generally based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by managements judgment of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. Anticipated loss ratios are based upon managements judgment considering the type of business covered, analysis of each ceding companys loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contracts underwritten by each ceding company, which are in turn ceded to BHRG. A range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared.  

Derivative contract liabilities  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. These contracts were entered into in over-the-counter markets. Certain elements of the terms and conditions of these contracts are not standard and we are not required to post collateral under most of these contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are based on valuation models that we believe would be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in establishing

Derivative contract liabilities (Continued)  

 prices. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options is inherently subjective. The values of contracts in an actual exchange are affected by market conditions and perceptions of the buyers and sellers. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model.  

We determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December 31, 2013 were 2.5% and 3.6%, respectively, and were approximately 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. The interest rates as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately 64 basis points and 95 basis points (on a weighted average basis), respectively, over benchmark interest rates and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component.  

The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about 7 years. The weighted average volatility used as of December 31, 2013 was approximately 20.7%, compared to 20.9% as of December 31, 2012. The weighted average volatilities are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract as compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contracts. The volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The impact on fair value as of December 31, 2013 ($4.7 billion) from changes in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For several years, we also have had exposures relating to a number of credit default contracts written involving corporate and state/municipality issuers. During 2013, all credit default contracts involving corporate issuers expired and at December 31, 2013, our remaining exposures relate to state/municipality exposures which begin to expire in 2019. The fair values of our state/municipality contracts are generally based on bond pricing data on the underlying bond issues and credit spread estimates. We monitor and review pricing data and spread estimates for consistency as well as reasonableness with respect to current market conditions. We make no significant adjustments to the pricing data or inputs obtained.  

Prices in a current market trade involving identical (or sufficiently similar) risks and contract terms as our equity index put option or credit default contracts could differ significantly from the fair values used in the financial statements. We do not operate as a derivatives dealer and currently do not utilize offsetting strategies to hedge our equity index put option or credit default contracts. We currently intend to allow these contracts to run off to their respective expiration dates.  

Other Critical Accounting Policies  

We record deferred charges with respect to liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts. At the inception of these contracts, the deferred charges represent the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over the consideration received. Deferred charges are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Deferred charge balances are adjusted periodically to reflect new projections of the amount and timing of remaining loss payments. Adjustments to deferred charge balances resulting from changes to these assumptions are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $4.35 billion at December 31, 2013. Significant changes in the estimated amount and the timing of payments of unpaid losses may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization.

Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $57.0 billion, which includes approximately $2.7 billion associated with our various acquisitions in 2013. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting units fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the individual assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.  

Market Risk Disclosures  

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.  

Interest Rate Risk  

We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire such securities that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur with respect to assets. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so that the cost of our debt is minimized. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks.  

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments may be more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments.  

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to

 prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Includes other investments that are subject to a significant level of interest rate risk.  

Equity Price Risk  

Historically, we have maintained large amounts of invested assets in exchange traded equity securities. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, with able and honest management and at sensible prices and prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2013, approximately 55% of the total fair value of equity investments was concentrated within four companies.  

We often hold equity investments for long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain above average levels of shareholder capital to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.  

Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions.  

We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. These contracts expire between 2018 and 2026 and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration dates.

The selected 30% hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Includes other investments that possess significant equity price risk.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

We generally do not use derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency price changes primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies such as The Coca-Cola Company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. Our net assets subject to translation are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy businesses, and to a lesser extent in our manufacturing and services businesses. The translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gains or losses on net reinsurance liabilities of certain U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies as well as the equity index put option liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries relating to contracts that would be settled in foreign currencies.  

Commodity Price Risk  

Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to a limited degree in managing commodity price risks, most notably at MidAmerican. MidAmericans exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the risk, MidAmerican uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recovered from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted

 if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. MidAmerican also uses futures, options and swap agreements to economically hedge gas and electric commodity prices for physical delivery to non-regulated customers.
