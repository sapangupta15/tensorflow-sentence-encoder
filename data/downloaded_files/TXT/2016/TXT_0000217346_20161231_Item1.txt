Textron Aviation markets its products worldwide through its own sales force, as well as through a network of authorized independent sales representatives. Textron Aviation has several competitors domestically and internationally in various market segments. Textron Aviations aircraft compete with other aircraft that vary in size, speed, range, capacity and handling characteristics on the basis of price, product quality and reliability, direct operating costs, product support and reputation. 

Bell Segment 

Bell Helicopter is one of the leading suppliers of military and commercial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and services in the world. Revenues for Bell accounted for approximately 23%, 26% and 31% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenues by Bells principal lines of business were as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bell supplies advanced military helicopters and support to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the United States. Bells primary U.S. Government programs are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters. Bell is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company (Boeing), the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Through its strategic alliance with Boeing, Bell produces and supports the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and also for Japan under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. The H-1 helicopter program includes a utility model, the UH-1Y, and an advanced attack model, the AH-1Z, which have 84% parts commonality between them. While the U.S. Marine Corps is the primary customer for H-1 helicopters, we have received orders for Pakistan under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. 

Through its commercial business, Bell is a leading supplier of commercially certified helicopters and support to corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue and emergency medical helicopter operators, and foreign governments. Bell produces a variety of commercial aircraft types, including light single- and twin-engine helicopters and medium twin-engine helicopters, along with other related products. The helicopters currently offered by Bell for commercial applications include the 206L-4, 407, 407GT, 407GXP, 412EP, 412EPI, 429 and Huey II. The new 505 Jet Ranger X, a short-light single helicopter, achieved certification in Canada at the end of 2016, with a follow-on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification expected in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, Bell achieved first flight in 2015 for the 525 Relentless, its first super medium commercial helicopter. On July 6, 2016, one of the two test aircraft used in flight testing for the 525 Relentless helicopters crashed. We are cooperating fully with the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation of the accident and working closely with the FAA on progressing toward certification of the 525. While we have temporarily suspended flight activity for the remaining test aircraft, other certification activities and production work on the 525 program continue. The timing of the aircrafts certification and entry into service will be determined upon resumption of flight testing. 

For both its military programs and its commercial products, Bell provides post-sale support and service for an installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters through a network of six Bell-operated service centers, four global parts distribution centers and over 100 independent service centers located in 32 countries. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support, including parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service and product support engineering.

Revenues of Kautex accounted for approximately 16%, 15% and 14% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Our automotive products have several major competitors worldwide, some of which are affiliated with the OEMs that comprise our targeted customer base. Competition typically is based on a number of factors including price, technology, environmental performance, product quality and reliability, prior experience and available manufacturing capacity. 

Specialized Vehicles and Equipment 

Our Specialized Vehicles and Equipment product line includes the products designed, manufactured and sold by our Textron Specialized Vehicles and Jacobsen businesses. As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Jacobsen business is being combined into the Textron Specialized Vehicles business in order to optimize efficiencies and better serve their shared customers and distributors. The Specialized Vehicles and Equipment product line includes the E-Z-GO, Textron Off Road, TUG Technologies, Douglas Equipment, Ransomes, Jacobsen, Cushman, Dixie Chopper, and the recently acquired Premier and Safeaero, businesses and brands. The businesses in this product line design, manufacture and sell golf cars, off-road utility vehicles, light transportation vehicles, aviation ground support equipment and professional turf-maintenance equipment, as well as specialized turf-care vehicles. 

These businesses have a diversified customer base that includes golf courses and resorts, government agencies and municipalities, consumers, and commercial and industrial users such as factories, warehouses, airports, planned communities, hunting preserves, educational and corporate campuses, sporting venues, municipalities and landscaping professionals. Sales are made through a combination of factory direct resources and a network of independent distributors and dealers worldwide. We have two major competitors for both golf cars and professional turf-maintenance equipment, and several competitors for off-road and light transportation vehicles, aviation ground support equipment, and specialized turf-care products. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and reliability, product features, product support and reputation. 

We recently entered into an agreement to acquire Arctic Cat Inc., a leader in the recreational vehicle industry. The company manufactures and markets all-terrain vehicles, side-by-sides and snowmobiles, in addition to related parts, garments and accessories under the Arctic Cat® and Motorfist® brand names. Subject to customary closing conditions, we expect the transaction to close in March 2017.

Finance Segment 

Our Finance segment, or the Finance group, is a commercial finance business that consists of Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Finance segment provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters. The majority of our finance receivables are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the U.S. Finance receivables originated in the U.S. are primarily for purchasers who had difficulty in accessing other sources of financing for the purchase of Textron-manufactured products. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Finance group paid our Manufacturing group $173 million, $194 million and $215 million, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products to third parties that were financed by the Finance group. 

The commercial finance business traditionally is extremely competitive. Our Finance segment is subject to competition from various types of financing institutions, including banks, leasing companies, commercial finance companies and finance operations of equipment vendors. Competition within the commercial finance industry primarily is focused on price, term, structure and service. 

Our Finance segments largest business risk is the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio. See Finance Portfolio Quality in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 28 for information about the Finance segments credit performance. 

Backlog 

Our backlog at the end of 2016 and 2015 is summarized below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Approximately 41% of our total backlog at December 31, 2016 represents orders that are not expected to be filled in 2017. 

At the end of 2016, approximately 61% of our total backlog was with the U.S. Government, which included only funded amounts as the U.S. Government is obligated only up to the amount of funding formally appropriated for a contract. Bells 2016 backlog included $1.7 billion related to a multi-year procurement contract with the U.S. Government for the purchase of V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. 

U.S. Government Contracts 

In 2016, approximately 25% of our consolidated revenues were generated by or resulted from contracts with the U.S. Government, excluding those contracts under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. This business is subject to competition, changes in procurement policies and regulations, the continuing availability of funding, which is dependent upon congressional appropriations, national and international priorities for defense spending, world events, and the size and timing of programs in which we may participate. 

Our contracts with the U.S. Government generally may be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination, including, if applicable, reasonable profit on such work, as well as reasonable termination costs. If, however, the U.S. Government terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted and services rendered, an agreed-upon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property, and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government may not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and may be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract; (c) the U.S. Government may not be liable for assets we own and utilize to provide services under the fee-for-service contracts; and (d) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.

Environmental Considerations 

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and expenditures for environmental control facilities has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional information regarding environmental matters is contained in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 65 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 36,000 employees.
