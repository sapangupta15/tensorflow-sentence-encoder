Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

 The following discussion of risk factors contains "forward-looking statements," as discussed in the "Business" section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A") section in Part II, Item 7, and the  

8 

Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in the "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" section of Part II, Item 8 of this report.  

 We caution the reader that the following risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.   

Our results may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.  

 Our results have historically been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry. A significant portion of our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.  

 In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to "self-insure," the use of so-called "captive" insurers, and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs.   

Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.  

 Since the Attorney General of New York ("NYAG") brought charges against one of our competitors in 2004, there has been uncertainty concerning then longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Soon after the NYAG brought those charges, Aon and certain other large insurance brokers announced that they would terminate contingent commission arrangements with underwriters and, during the period 2005 through 2008, Aon and three other large insurance brokers entered into agreements with a number of state attorneys general and insurance regulators in which they covenanted to refrain from taking contingent commissions. Most other insurance brokers, however, continued to enter into contingent commission arrangements, and regulators have not taken action consistently to end or prohibit such arrangements. In July 2008, New York regulators held hearings on potential rules relating to insurance producer compensation and disclosures. As a result of those hearings and public comments, New York regulators promulgated Regulation No. 194 in February 2010, which is expected to be effective January 1, 2011. Regulation No. 194 does not prohibit producers from accepting contingent commissions as compensation from insurers, but does obligate all insurance producers to abide by certain minimally prescribed uniform standards of compensation disclosure. Effective as of February 11, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated agreement (the "Amended Settlement Agreement") with the Attorneys General of the States of New York, Illinois and Connecticut, the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, which supersedes and replaces the earlier agreement with those regulators. The Amended Settlement Agreement requires us, among other things, to provide, throughout the United States, compensation disclosure that complies, at a minimum, with the requirements of Regulation 194 or the provisions of the original settlement agreement with those regulators. The Amended Settlement Agreement also requires compliance with any rules, regulations or guidance issued by the attorneys general or insurance departments of Illinois, Connecticut and any other states in which we conduct business. The Amended Settlement Agreement does not prohibit us from accepting contingent compensation. Notwithstanding the Amended Settlement Agreement, we remain bound by: (1) the Settlement Agreement entered into in 2008 between Aon and the Florida  

9 

Department of Financial Services, the Florida Department of Legal Affairs, Office of the Attorney General, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation; and (2) the Agreement entered in 2006 between certain insurance regulator members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners of 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam and Aon, both of which prohibit us from accepting or requesting of any insurer contingent compensation and impose certain business reforms.   

Our results may be adversely affected by the impact that disruptions in the credit and financial markets have on our customers and the insurance industry.  

 Beginning in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets may reduce our customers' demand for our brokerage and reinsurance services and products, including increasing their levels of self-insurance. Other clients may be significantly impacted by credit pressures or other financial difficulties which could result in their insolvency. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which could then reduce placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by clients.  

 The current economic conditions have also created significant uncertainty in the industries in which our consulting operations participate. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn could hurt our clients' financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. These challenges may reduce demand for some of our services or depress pricing of those services and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   

We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  

 We believe that competition in our brokerage lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.  

 We encounter strong competition for both clients and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms that also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk related services and products. Our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world.   

We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plans.  

 We announced a global restructuring plan (the "Aon Benfield Plan") in connection with our merger with Benfield in 2008. The restructuring plan is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 700 job eliminations, the closing or consolidation of several offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We estimate that the Aon Benfield Plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $155 million over a three-year period, of which $55 million of these costs were included in the purchase price allocation and $100 million of which have been or will be charged to earnings. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the Aon Benfield Plan will be approximately $122 million in 2011. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.  

10 

 In 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and to reduce future expense growth to better serve clients (the "2007 Plan"). As a result, we have adopted restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in the elimination of an estimated 4,600 employee positions, the closing or consolidation of various offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We estimate that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges of $750 million. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the 2007 Plan will be approximately $536 million by the end of 2010. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.   

Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.  

 Operating funds available for corporate use and funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $639 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. These funds are reported in cash, short-term investments, and fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2009, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $319 million. Changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from cash balances and short-term investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our long-term investments. We monitor our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairments in carrying value. For securities judged to have an other-than-temporary impairment, we write down the value of those securities and recognize a realized loss through the Consolidated Statement of Income.   

Our pension obligations could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.  

 To the extent that the present value of the pension obligations associated with our major plans continue to exceed the value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In certain previous years, there have been declines in interest rates. As a result of lower interest rates and investment returns, the present value of plan liabilities increased faster than the value of plan assets, resulting in significantly higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans.  

 We currently plan on contributing approximately $381 million to our major pension plans in 2010, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2009 were $437 million, which was an increase of $260 million from 2008.  

 The magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our pension expense is comparatively sensitive to various market factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our financial position and results of operations from year to year.  

 The periodic revision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those that have been estimated.  

11 

We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  

 We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which frequently include errors and omissions ("E&O") claims. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. We have historically purchased E&O insurance and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 At the time of the 2004-05 investigation of the insurance industry by the NYAG and other regulators, purported classes of clients filed civil litigation against us and other companies under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") theories. The federal actions were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was filed in California. In the New Jersey actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' federal antitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. We believe we have meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.  

 Also at the time of the NYAG investigation, putative classes filed actions against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the federal securities laws and ERISA. Plaintiffs in the federal securities class action originally submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $353 million to $490 million, and plaintiffs in the ERISA class actions originally submitted revised purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $74 million to $349 million. To protect against the uncertain outcome of litigation and to contain exposure to us, we settled the securities suit for $30 million in 2009 and have reached an agreement in principle to settle the ERISA suit for $1.8 million. On November 24, 2009, the Court entered a final order approving the settlement and dismissing the securities suit. The proposed ERISA settlement is subject to documentation, notice and court approval.  

 Following inquiries from regulators, we commenced an internal review of our compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). In January 2009, Aon Limited, our principal U.K. brokerage subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with the FSA to pay a £5.25 million fine arising from its failure to exercise reasonable care to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to counter the risks of bribery arising from the use of overseas firms and individuals who helped it win business. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") continue to investigate these matters. We are fully cooperating with these investigations and have agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current information, we are unable to predict at this time when the SEC and DOJ matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.  

 A putative class action, Buckner v. Resource Life, is pending in state court in Columbus, Georgia against a former subsidiary of ours, Resource Life Insurance Company. The complaint alleges that Resource Life, which wrote policies insuring repayment of auto loans, was obligated to identify and return unearned premiums to policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled  

12 

terms. In connection with the sale of Resource Life in 2006, we agreed to indemnify Resource Life's buyer in certain respects relating to this action. We believe that Resource Life has meritorious defenses, and Resource Life is vigorously defending this action. In October 2009, the court certified a nationwide class of policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled terms and who Resource Life cannot prove received a refund of unearned premium. Resource Life has taken an appeal from that decision. Also in October 2009, we filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to our and Resource Life's rights and obligations under the indemnity agreement. The outcome of the actions, and the amount of any losses or other payments that may result, cannot be predicted at this time.  

 Although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.  

 In addition to the matters referred to above, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable which are deemed to be probable and estimable are accrued in our consolidated financial statements.  

 We have total letters of credit ("LOC") outstanding for approximately $153 million at December 31, 2009. These letters of credit are for the benefit of Virginia Surety Company ("VSC") related to a non-performance risk of reinsurers of VSC's worker's compensation business in California, a LOC that secures deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program, and LOCs to cover the beneficiaries related to our Canadian pension plan scheme, secure one of our U.S. pension plans, and to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties.   

We are subject to E&O claims against us.  

 We assist our clients with various matters, including the placement of insurance coverage or employee benefit plans and the handling of related claims. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, E&O claims may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant and, in addition to potential liability for monetary damages, could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. In recent years, we have assumed increasing levels of self-insurance for potential E&O exposures. We use case level reviews by inside and outside counsel to establish loss reserves in accordance with applicable accounting standards. These reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  

 Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including brokers and other professional personnel. Competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.   

Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.  

 Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services, or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. With respect to our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services business, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.  

 Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, and the FCPA, do affect the insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.  

 With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses and increased training and employee expenses. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.  

 In all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.  

 In addition, new legislative or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us. These developments include:    

the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;   

changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;   

the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage;   

14 

changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans; or   

additional regulations promulgated by the FSA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.   

 Competition resulting from these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   

Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.  

 A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:    

the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries;   

devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;   

imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;   

imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;   

difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;   

hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;   

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;   

longer payment cycles;   

greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection; and   

the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.    

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.  

 Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our four largest exposures in order of sensitivity are the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. As slightly more than half of our pretax income is non-U.S. Dollar denominated, a weaker U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, would produce more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements. Offsetting our normal translation exposure is our transactional exposure between the U.S. Dollar revenue and British Pound expense. In the U.K., part of our revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, although our operating expenses are denominated in British Pounds. Therefore, a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound would produce more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the real cost to our customers in foreign markets where we receive our revenue in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could potentially affect demand for our services.  

15 

 Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.   

Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.  

 The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. A growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with us.   

We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  

 As of December 31, 2009, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.0 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures. If at the time of maturity we do not have sufficient operating cash or credit lines to repay the borrowing and are unable to borrow from a third party in an amount sufficient to repay the maturing debt, then an event of default would occur.  

 We have two primary committed credit facilities outstanding, one for our U.S. operations, the other for our European operations. The U.S. facility totals $400 million and matures in December 2012. It is intended as a back-up against commercial paper or to address capital needs in times of extreme liquidity pressure. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings under this facility. The Euro facility totals €650 million ($937 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) and matures in October 2010. It is intended as a revolving working capital line for our European operations. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings under this facility. Both facilities require certain representations and warranties to be made before drawing and both have the same financial covenants. The representations and warrants are standard for agreements of this type and include such things as: compliance with laws and contracts, timely filing of taxes, and insurance licenses in good standing. For both facilities, we are required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of at least 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of no greater than 3 to 1. At December 31, 2009, we could make all representations and warranties and were within our financial covenants.   

A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.  

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, and reduce our financial flexibility. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were BBB+ (Standard & Poor's and Fitch, Inc.) and Baa2 (Moody's Investor Services).  

 A downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. We cannot assume that our financial position would not be adversely affected if we were unable to access the commercial paper market.  

16 

Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.  

 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.   

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.  

 Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. While our principal subsidiaries currently are not limited by material contractual restrictions on their abilities to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their capital stock to us, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. These regulatory restrictions may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or advance to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, due to differences in tax rates, repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us.   

The occurrence of natural or man made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  

 We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tornadoes, and pandemic health events such as H1N1 influenza, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.  

 A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies' ability to pay principal or interest on their securities. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.  

 Through our merger with Benfield, we acquired equity interests in Juniperus Insurance Opportunities Fund Limited ("Juniperus") and Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited ("JCHL"). Juniperus invests its equity in a limited liability company that is expected to invest in excess of 70% of its assets in collateralized reinsurance transactions through collateralized swaps with a reinsurance company, and the remaining assets in instruments such as catastrophe bonds, industry loss warrants and insurer or reinsurer sidecar debt and equity arrangements. JCHL provides investment management and related services to Juniperus. If a disaster such as wind, earthquakes or other named catastrophe occurs, we could lose some or all of our equity investment in Juniperus of approximately $73 million.  

17 

 As part of the Benfield merger, we acquired Benfield's equity stake in certain Florida-domiciled homeowner insurance companies. We maintain ongoing agreements to provide modeling, actuarial, and consulting services to these insurance companies. These firms' financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing their underwriting reserves differ from actual experience. Reserve estimates represent informed judgments based on currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause estimates to vary. Additionally, a natural disaster occurring in Florida could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims relating to these existing service agreements.   

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.  

 Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems would provide us with an important advantage. Nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.  

 Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.  

 We regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.   

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.  

 One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients' confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  

 Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.   

In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy, we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses.  

 In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses, or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify

appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.   

The global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes could create volatility in our effective tax rate, could expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and could cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.  

 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation, our global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the timing and recognition of goodwill impairments, the transfer pricing of revenues and costs, acquisitions and dispositions, and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. It is complex to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations administered by foreign governmental agencies, some of which may conflict with the U.S. or other foreign law. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Favorable resolution of such matters would typically be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Conversely, unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. Such an adverse outcome could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While historically we have not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns, there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise.   

The anticipated benefits from the merger with Benfield may not be realized.  

 The success of the merger with Benfield will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Aon and Benfield including, among other things, synergies, cost savings, operating efficiencies and the integration of information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems. Although we expect to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, no assurance can be given that we will successfully combine the businesses of Aon and Benfield and that these anticipated benefits will actually be achieved because achieving such benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties. Additionally, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating Benfield with Aon. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If we fail to realize all or some of the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition or if we fail to realize those benefits in the anticipated time period, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
