PART I  

Item 1. Business  

Introduction  

Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.  

When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, the firm, we, us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.  

References to this Form 10-K are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. References to the 2015 Form 10-K are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. All references to 2016, 2015 and 2014 refer to our years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  

Group Inc. is a bank holding company and a financial holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank.  

As of December 2016, we had offices in over 30 countries and 47% of our total staff was based outside the Americas. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. In 2016, we generated 40% of our net revenues outside the Americas.

Investment Banking  

Investment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services and help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients the entire resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact with Goldman Sachs.  

Financial Advisory. Financial Advisory includes strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings, spin-offs and risk management. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. Financial Advisory also includes revenues from derivative transactions directly related to these client advisory assignments. We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital. 

Underwriting. The other core activity of Investment Banking is helping companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow the savings of millions of people, with the needs of our public and private sector clients, who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans. Underwriting also includes revenues from derivative transactions entered into with public and private sector clients in connection with our underwriting activities.  

Equity Underwriting. We underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years.  

Debt Underwriting. We underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade and high-yield debt, bank loans and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities.  

Institutional Client Services  

Institutional Client Services serves our clients who come to us to buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Institutional Client Services makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in and clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide.  

As a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Our clients are primarily institutions that are professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate customers include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or putting aside surplus cash in a deposit account.  

Through our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms and operates globally wherever and whenever markets are open for trading.  

Institutional Client Services and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December 2016, provided fundamental research on more than 3,000 companies worldwide and more than 40 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities.  

Institutional Client Services generates revenues in the following ways:  

     

In large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury bills, large capitalization S&P 500 stocks or certain mortgage pass-through securities), we execute a high volume of transactions for our clients;  

     

In less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, growth market currencies or certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities), we execute transactions for our clients for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets;  

     

We also structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline); and  

     

We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities, as well as securities lending and other prime brokerage services.  

In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain inventory, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. We also hold inventory to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities. 

Institutional Client Services activities are organized by asset class and include both cash and derivative instruments. Cash refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). Derivative refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond or stock index on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).  

Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution. Includes client execution activities related to making markets in both cash and derivative instruments for interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities.  

     

Interest Rate Products. Government bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, repurchase agreements, and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.  

     

Credit Products. Investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds, bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.  

     

Mortgages. Commercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.  

     

Currencies. Currency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on G-10 currencies and emerging-market products.  

     

Commodities. Commodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products.

Equities. Includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services.  

Equities Client Execution. We make markets in equity securities and equity-related products, including exchange-traded funds, convertible securities, options, futures and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis. As a principal, we facilitate client transactions by providing liquidity to our clients, including with large blocks of stocks or derivatives, requiring the commitment of our capital.  

We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry groups, financial measures and individual company stocks. We develop strategies and provide information about portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions for our clients. We also work with our clients to create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to establish or liquidate investment positions or undertake hedging strategies. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments.  

Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and exchange-traded funds, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide.  

Commissions and Fees. We generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. We provide our clients with access to a broad spectrum of equity execution services, including electronic low-touch access and more complex high-touch execution through both traditional and electronic platforms.  

Securities Services. Includes financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services.  

     

Financing Services. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our client.  

     

Securities Lending Services. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. 

     

Other Prime Brokerage Services. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. In addition, we provide our hedge fund and other clients with a technology platform and reporting which enables them to monitor their security portfolios and manage risk exposures.  

Investing & Lending  

Our investing and lending activities, which are typically longer-term, include our investing and relationship lending activities across various asset classes, primarily debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure and real estate. These activities include investing directly in publicly and privately traded securities and in loans, and also through certain investment funds that we manage and through funds managed by external parties. We also provide financing to corporate clients and individuals, including bank loans, personal loans and mortgages.  

Equity Securities. We make corporate, real estate, infrastructure and other equity-related investments.  

Debt Securities and Loans. We make corporate, real estate, infrastructure and other debt investments. In addition, we provide credit to corporate clients through loan facilities and to individuals primarily through secured loans. We also make unsecured loans to individuals through our online platform.  

Investment Management  

Investment Management provides investment and wealth advisory services to help clients preserve and grow their financial assets. Our clients include institutions and high-net-worth individuals, as well as retail investors who primarily access our products through a network of third-party distributors around the world.  

We manage client assets across a broad range of asset classes and investment strategies, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily include hedge funds, credit funds, private equity, real estate, currencies, commodities, and asset allocation strategies. Our investment offerings include those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers as well as strategies managed by third-party managers. We offer our investments in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships, and other commingled vehicles.

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

We also provide customized investment advisory solutions designed to address our clients investment needs. These solutions begin with identifying clients objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. We draw from a variety of third-party managers as well as our proprietary offerings to implement solutions for clients.  

We supplement our investment advisory solutions for high-net-worth clients with wealth advisory services that include income and liability management, trust and estate planning, philanthropic giving and tax planning. We also use our global securities and derivatives market-making capabilities to address clients specific investment needs.  

Management and Other Fees. The majority of revenues in management and other fees is comprised of asset-based fees on client assets. The fees that we charge vary by asset class and distribution channel and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and redemptions. Other fees we receive primarily include financial counseling fees generated through our wealth advisory services.  

Assets under supervision include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. Assets under supervision also include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. Assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. Long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. Liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit assets.  

Incentive Fees. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds or a separately managed accounts return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a funds investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. Incentive fees are recognized only when all material contingencies are resolved. 

Transaction Revenues. We receive commissions and net spreads for facilitating transactional activity in high-net-worth client accounts. In addition, we earn net interest income primarily associated with client deposits and margin lending activity undertaken by such clients.  

Other Activities  

We accept deposits directly from individuals through our online platform. Our online deposits are used to finance, among other things, our lending activity and other inventory.  

Business Continuity and Information Security  

Business continuity and information security, including cyber security, are high priorities for Goldman Sachs. Their importance has been highlighted by numerous highly publicized events in recent years, including cyber attacks against financial institutions, large consumer-based companies and other organizations that resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information of clients and customers and other sensitive or confidential information and the theft and destruction of corporate information, and extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Sandy.  

Our Business Continuity Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or systems and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a bank holding company, our Business Continuity Program is also subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board. The key elements of the program are crisis planning and management, people recovery, business recovery, systems and data recovery, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and that of the firm from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

Employees  

Management believes that a major strength and principal reason for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.  

Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach, and includes an evaluation of an employees performance with respect to risk management, compliance and diversity. As of December 2016, we had 34,400 total staff.  

Competition  

The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.  

There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. 

Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S. We also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them.  

A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking and client execution businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution.  

The provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulation could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory developments on our competitive position will depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the new regulatory regimes as described further under Regulation below.  

We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See Regulation  Compensation Practices below and Risk Factors  Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information about the regulation of our compensation practices.  

Regulation  

As a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation worldwide. Our businesses have been subject to increasing regulation and supervision in the U.S. and other countries.  

In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules thereunder, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate. The capital, liquidity and leverage ratios based on the Basel Committees final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III), as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, the PRA and FCA and other national regulators, have also had a significant impact on our businesses. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation, and its member jurisdictions implement regulations based on its standards and guidelines. 

The implications of such regulations for our businesses continue to depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by such regulations.  

Other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described further throughout this section. Recent political developments, including the new presidential administration in the U.S., have added additional uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms, including potential deregulation in some areas. On February 3, 2017, the President of the U.S. issued an executive order identifying core principles for the administrations financial services regulatory policy and directing the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other financial regulatory agencies, to evaluate how the current regulatory framework promotes or inhibits the principles and what actions have been, and are being, taken to promote the principles.  

Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), our principal E.U. operating subsidiaries, are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K. and, as such, are subject to E.U. legal and regulatory requirements, based on directly binding regulations of the E.U. and the implementation of E.U. directives by the U.K. Both currently benefit from non-discriminatory access to E.U. clients and infrastructure based on E.U. treaties and E.U. legislation, including cross-border passporting arrangements and specific arrangements for the establishment of E.U. branches. There is considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory regime that will be applicable in the U.K. following the U.K. referendum vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) and the regulatory framework that will govern transactions and business undertaken by our U.K. subsidiaries in the remaining E.U. countries.  

Banking Supervision and Regulation  

Group Inc. is a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and a financial holding company under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Under the system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization. The primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the Federal Reserve Board exercising a supervisory role. Such functionally regulated U.S. non-bank subsidiaries include broker-dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities.  

Various of our subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate.  

Our principal U.S. bank subsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A number of our activities are conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: origination of bank loans; personal loans and mortgages; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; structured finance; deposit-taking; and agency lending. Our consumer-oriented activities are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state regulators with regard to consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and other practices in connection with marketing and providing consumer financial products.  

GSI, our regulated U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary, which is designated as an investment firm, and GSIB, our regulated U.K. bank and principal non-U.S. bank subsidiary, are supervised and regulated by the PRA and the FCA. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K., and GSIB acts as a primary dealer for European government bonds and is involved in market making in European government bonds, lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities.  

GSI, GSIB and other regulated entities in the E.U. are subject to directly binding regulations of the E.U. and national implementation of E.U. directives, where applicable. 

Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements. We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital and leverage requirements set forth by the Federal Reserve Board. GS Bank USA is subject to capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in substantially the same manner as those applicable to Group Inc., also set forth by the Federal Reserve Board. GSI is subject to capital requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV).  

Under the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy requirements, Group Inc. and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Group Inc. and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, and GSI is subject to similar requirements established by U.K. regulatory authorities.  

Capital Ratios. We are subject to the Federal Reserve Boards revised risk-based capital and leverage regulations, inclusive of certain transitional provisions (Revised Capital Framework). The Revised Capital Framework is largely based on Basel III and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Revised Capital Framework, we are an Advanced approach banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).  

The Revised Capital Framework provides for three additional capital ratio requirements that phase in over time: (i) for capital conservation (capital conservation buffer), (ii) as a consequence of our designation as a G-SIB (G-SIB buffer) and (iii) for counter-cyclicality (counter-cyclical buffer). These additional capital ratio requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1).  

The capital conservation buffer began to phase in on January 1, 2016 and will continue to do so in increments of 0.625% per year until it reaches 2.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) on January 1, 2019. The G-SIB buffer also began to phase in on January 1, 2016 and will continue to do so through January 1, 2019.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

The counter-cyclical buffer, of up to 2.5%, is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and applies only to Advanced approach banking organizations. The counter-cyclical buffer is currently set at zero percent. Several other national supervisors have also started to require counter-cyclical buffers. The G-SIB and counter-cyclical buffers applicable to us could change in the future and, as a result, the minimum capital ratios we are subject to could increase.  

GS Bank USA also computes its capital ratios in accordance with the Revised Capital Framework as an Advanced approach banking organization.  

The Basel Committee has published final guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). If these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they will apply to, among others, certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs. These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based. CRD IV and the CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements of up to 2% of CET1, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII buffers). O-SIIs are identified annually, along with their applicable buffers. During 2016, the PRA identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII. GSG UKs O-SII buffer is currently set at zero percent.  

The Basel Committee has issued a series of updates that propose other changes to capital regulations. In particular, in January 2016, the Basel Committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk, which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations. The Basel Committee has set an effective date for reporting under the revised framework for market risk capital of December 31, 2019. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these revisions for U.S. banking organizations. In November 2016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR to implement these revisions for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSI. 

The Basel Committee has also:  

     

Finalized a revised standard approach for calculating RWAs for counterparty credit risk on derivatives exposures (Standardized Approach for measuring Counterparty Credit Risk exposures, known as SA-CCR);  

     

Published guidelines for measuring and controlling large exposures (Supervisory Framework for measuring and controlling Large Exposures); and

Leverage Ratios. Under the Revised Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. The Revised Capital Framework also introduced a supplementary leverage ratio for Advanced approach banking organizations effective January 1, 2018 which implements the Basel III leverage ratio framework.  

In November 2016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR to implement a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSI, which would implement the Basel III leverage ratio framework.  

See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our and GS Bank USAs Tier 1 leverage ratios and supplementary leverage ratios and GSIs leverage ratio.  

Liquidity Ratios. The Basel Committees international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests.  

The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) applicable to both Group Inc. and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committees framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario.  

In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule that requires bank holding companies to disclose, on a quarterly basis beginning with the second quarter of 2017, LCR averages over the quarter, quantitative and qualitative information on certain components of the LCR calculation and projected net cash outflows. 

The LCR rule issued by the European Commission became effective in the U.K. on October 1, 2015, with a phase-in period whereby certain financial institutions, including GSI, must have a 90% and 100% minimum ratio commencing on January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018, respectively.  

The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance-sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committees NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%, and will be effective on January 1, 2018. In May 2016, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would implement an NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including Group Inc. The proposal would require banking organizations to ensure they have stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The proposed NSFR requirement has an effective date of January 1, 2018, including a requirement for quarterly public disclosure of the ratio, as well as a description of the banking organizations stable funding sources.  

In November 2016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR to implement the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSI.  

The enhanced prudential standards implemented by the Federal Reserve Board under the Dodd-Frank Act require bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (covered BHCs) to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement.  

See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Risk Management  Overview and Structure of Risk Management and  Liquidity Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity.

Stress Tests. Covered BHCs, including Group Inc., are subject to Dodd-Frank Act annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and semi-annual company-run stress tests. The stress test rules require increased involvement by boards of directors in stress testing and public disclosure of the results of both the Federal Reserve Boards annual stress tests and a bank holding companys annual supervisory stress tests, and semi-annual internal stress tests.  

We publish summaries of our annual and mid-cycle stress tests results on our website as described under Available Information below. Our annual Dodd-Frank Act stress test submission is incorporated into the annual capital plans that we submit to the Federal Reserve Board as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The purpose of CCAR is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each institutions unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board evaluates an institutions plan to make capital distributions, such as repurchasing or redeeming stock or increasing dividend payments, across a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions.  

GS Bank USA is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis, to submit the results to the Federal Reserve Board, and to make a summary of those results public. The rules require that the board of directors of GS Bank USA, among other things, consider the results of the stress tests in the normal course of the banks business, including, but not limited to, its capital planning, assessment of capital adequacy and risk management practices. GSI also has its own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the PRAs Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.  

Dividends and Stock Repurchases. Dividend payments by Group Inc. to its shareholders and stock repurchases by Group Inc. are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. The dividend and share repurchase policies of large bank holding companies, such as Group Inc., are reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board through the CCAR process, based on capital plans and stress tests submitted by the bank holding company, and are assessed against, among other things, the bank holding companys ability to meet and exceed minimum regulatory capital ratios under stressed scenarios, its expected sources and uses of capital over the planning horizon under baseline and stressed scenarios, and any potential impact of changes to its business plan and activities on its capital adequacy and liquidity. 

The Federal Reserve Boards capital plan rule includes a limitation on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in the capital plan submission.  

U.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entitys undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus).  

The applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring a payment by a holding company subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve Board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.  

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a bank holding company commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the Federal Reserve Boards invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the holding company and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the bank holding company.

Transactions between Affiliates. Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand, are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. These regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (including credit extensions from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions.  

Resolution and Recovery. Group Inc. is required by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to provide a periodic plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). Our resolution plan must, among other things, demonstrate that GS Bank USA is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. The regulators joint rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of the companys material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. If the regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to cure identified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations or may jointly order the institutions to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  Resolution and Recovery Plans in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about our resolution plan.  

We are also required by the Federal Reserve Board to submit, and have submitted, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that management could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. 

The FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities.  

The E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSI. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant bail-in powers to E.U. resolution authorities to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. (including GSI) must provide that new contracts enable such actions and also amend pre-existing contracts governed by non-E.U. law to enable such actions, if the financial institutions could incur liabilities under such pre-existing contracts.  

The BRRD also subjects financial institutions to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) so that they can be resolved without causing financial instability and without recourse to public funds in the event of a failure. The Bank of Englands rules on MREL are described below under Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity.  

In May 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released a proposal that would impose restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) of G-SIBs. This proposal is intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability of the G-SIB to transact with QFC counterparties unless such counterparties waive rights to terminate such contracts immediately upon the entry of the G-SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution. The effective date is proposed to be approximately one year after the proposal is finalized.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity. In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule establishing loss-absorbency and related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs such as Group Inc. The rule will be effective in January 2019 with no phase-in period. The rule addresses U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Boards (FSB) total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs. The rule (i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements, (ii) establishes minimum eligible long-term debt (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity greater than one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) requirements, (iii) prohibits certain holding company transactions and (iv) caps the amount of G-SIB liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.  

The rule also prohibits a U.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing liabilities of subsidiaries that are subject to early termination provisions if the parent company of a U.S. G-SIB enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs, which have not yet been adopted; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties.  

Additionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the U.S. G-SIBs eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt.  

In October 2016, the Basel Committee issued a final standard to implement capital deductions for banking organizations relating to TLAC holdings of other G-SIBs. This standard will inform how the deductions are implemented by national regulators.  

The FSB, an international body that sets standards and coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies, issued a final TLAC standard requiring certain material subsidiaries of a G-SIB organized outside of the G-SIBs home country, such as GSI, to maintain amounts of TLAC to facilitate the transfer of losses from operating subsidiaries to the parent company. In December 2016, the FSB issued a consultative document that presents a set of guiding principles on the implementation of the TLAC requirements applicable to material subsidiaries. As an obligation of membership, the FSBs members, including the U.S., commit to implement international financial standards, including those of the FSB. 

The BRRD subjects institutions to MREL, which is generally consistent with the FSBs TLAC standard. In November 2016, the Bank of England published its policy on setting MREL under which certain U.K. financial institutions will be required to maintain equity and liabilities sufficient to credibly bear losses in resolution. The Bank of England has not yet published its final policy on the calibration of MREL for entities that are parts of groups, such as GSI.  

In November 2016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR and BRRD that are designed to implement the FSBs minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs commencing January 1, 2019. The proposal would require subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB that account for more than 5% of our RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSI, to meet 90% of the requirement applicable to E.U. G-SIBs.  

In November 2016, the European Commission also proposed an amendment to CRD IV that would require a non-E.U. G-SIB, such as Group Inc., to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) if the firm has two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks, such as GSI and GSIB. This proposal is subject to adoption at the E.U. level and implementing rulemakings by E.U. member states. The European Commission also proposed amendments to the CRR that would require E.U. IHCs to satisfy MREL requirements and certain other prudential requirements.  

Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power:  

     

To transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed bridge bank, without the approval of the depository institutions creditors;  

     

To enforce the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or  

     

To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution. 

     Goldman Sachs 2016 Form 10-K   13

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

In addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders of the institution, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors of GS Bank USA.  

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime (known as orderly liquidation authority (OLA)) for bank holding companies and their affiliates that are systemically important and certain non-bank financial companies. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institutions failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects.  

If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA were generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  

Substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. 

The OLA provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective upon enactment. The FDIC has completed several rulemakings and taken other actions under OLA, including the issuance of a notice describing some elements of its single point of entry or SPOE strategy pursuant to the OLA provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this strategy, the FDIC would, among other things, resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets to a bridge holding company.  

We, along with a number of other major global banking organizations, adhere to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Resolution Stay Protocol (the ISDA Protocol) that was developed and updated in coordination with the FSB. The ISDA Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivatives contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA in the U.S. The ISDA Protocol is expected to be adopted more broadly in the future, following the adoption of regulations by banking regulators (including the Federal Reserve Boards proposal on QFCs described above), and expanded to include instances where a U.S. financial holding company becomes subject to proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  

FDIC Insurance. GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. The amounts of these assessments for larger depository institutions (generally those that have $10 billion in assets or more), such as GS Bank USA, are currently based on the average total consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, the supervisory ratings of the insured depository institution and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The assessment rate is subject to adjustment by the FDIC.  

In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule increasing the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35% of total insured deposits. The rule imposes a surcharge on the assessments of larger depository institutions, that began in the third quarter of 2016 and continues through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% and December 31, 2018. Under the rule, if the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on larger depository institutions, including GS Bank USA.

Prompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described under Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company above.  

The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding companys depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the holding company, the guarantee would take priority over the holding companys general unsecured creditors, as described under Source of Strength above.  

Activities. The Dodd-Frank Act and the BHC Act generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. 

Volcker Rule. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the Volcker Rule became effective in July 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits proprietary trading, but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements. The reporting requirements include calculating daily quantitative metrics on covered trading activities (as defined in the rule) and providing these metrics to regulators on a monthly basis.  

In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including Group Inc. and its subsidiaries. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to reduce our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the funds net asset value, and to reduce our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.  

In July 2016, the Federal Reserve Board extended the conformance period through July 2017 for investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released guidance regarding the extended conformance period available for legacy illiquid funds (as defined in the Volcker Rule) and the process for banking entities to request an extension of the conformance period for those funds of up to an additional five years beyond the expiration of the general conformance period in July 2017. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our investments in covered funds.

Other Restrictions. Financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for bank holding companies as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding companies. The broader range of permissible activities for financial holding companies includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-financial companies (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain financial holding companies are permitted under the GLB Act to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for bank holding companies, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets.  

The Federal Reserve Board, however, has the authority to limit a financial holding companys ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the financial holding company does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the Federal Reserve Board. For example, if a financial holding company or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the financial holding company may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.  

If any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the financial holding company would be subject to similar restrictions on activities.  

In addition, we are required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S. 

In September 2016, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposed rule which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical commodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of financial holding companies. The proposed rule would, among other things, (i) require companies to hold additional capital in connection with covered physical commodity activities, including merchant banking investments in companies engaged in physical commodity activities; (ii) tighten the quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity; and (iii) establish new public reporting requirements on the nature and extent of firms physical commodity holdings and activities. In addition, in a September 2016 report, the Federal Reserve Board recommended that Congress repeal (i) the authority of financial holding companies to engage in merchant banking activities; and (ii) the authority described above for certain financial holding companies to engage in certain otherwise permissible commodities activities.  

In March 2016, the Federal Reserve Board issued a revised proposal regarding single counterparty credit limits, which would impose more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. Such limits (together with other provisions incorporated into the Basel III capital rules) may affect our ability to transact or hedge with other financial institutions. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has proposed early remediation requirements, which are modeled on the prompt corrective action regime, described under Prompt Corrective Action above, but are designed to require action to begin in earlier stages of a companys financial distress, based on a range of triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management.  

In addition, New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USAs activities.  

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions.

Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation 

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co.  

In addition, U.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices, as described further below, as well as under Other Regulation. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&Co., see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  

In Europe, we provide broker-dealer services that are subject to oversight by national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which implement E.U. directives, and, increasingly, by directly applicable E.U. regulations. These national and E.U. laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules.  

Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japans Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, among others. 

Also, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC. Various of our other subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate, including, among others, Brazil and Dubai.  

Our exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.  

The Dodd-Frank Act will result in additional regulation by the SEC, the CFTC and other regulators of our broker-dealer and regulated subsidiaries in a number of respects. The law calls for the imposition of expanded standards of care by market participants in dealing with clients and customers, including by providing the SEC with authority to adopt rules establishing fiduciary duties for broker-dealers and directing the SEC to examine and improve sales practices and disclosure by broker-dealers and investment advisers.  

In addition, in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued final rules expanding the circumstances in which a person would be treated as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by reason of providing investment advice to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, as well as final exemptions. These rules and exemptions are scheduled to become effective on April 10, 2017. On February 3, 2017, the President of the U.S. directed the Secretary of Labor to prepare an updated analysis of the likely impact of the rules and to consider whether to propose to rescind or revise the rules.

Our U.S. broker-dealer and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates an asset-backed security transaction to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. Securitizations would also be affected by rules proposed by the SEC to implement the Dodd-Frank Acts prohibition against securitization participants engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with an investor in a securitization transaction. The proposed rules would exempt bona fide market-making activities and risk-mitigating hedging activities in connection with securitization activities from the general prohibition.  

The SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations.  

Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation  

The commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. GS&Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are registered with the CFTC and act as commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors and/or swap dealers, and are subject to CFTC regulations. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern the commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities of these entities. In addition, Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives activities. 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides for significantly increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivative markets and transactions. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes the following requirements relating to swaps and security-based swaps:  

     

Real-time public and regulatory reporting of trade information for swaps and security-based swaps and large trader reporting for swaps;  

     

Registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the CFTC and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the SEC;  

     

Position limits, aggregated generally across commonly controlled accounts and commonly controlled affiliates, that cap exposure to derivatives on certain physical commodities;  

     

Mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps and security-based swaps;  

     

New business conduct standards and other requirements for swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, covering their relationships with counterparties, internal oversight and compliance structures, conflict of interest rules, internal information barriers, general and trade-specific record-keeping and risk management;  

     

Margin requirements for trades that are not cleared through a central counterparty; and  

     

Entity-level capital requirements for swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants.  

The terms swaps and security-based swaps are generally defined broadly for purposes of these requirements, and can include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally called swaps. The definition includes certain forward contracts, options, certain loan participations and guarantees of swaps, subject to certain exceptions, and relates to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

In general, the CFTC is responsible for issuing rules relating to swaps, swap dealers and major swap participants, and the SEC is responsible for issuing rules relating to security-based swaps, security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies (acting jointly) are responsible for issuing margin rules for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps for swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants subject to their oversight. In September 2016, the final margin rules issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the CFTC for uncleared swaps became effective. These rules will phase in through March 2017 for variation margin requirements and through September 2020 for initial margin requirements depending on the level of swaps, security-based swaps and/or exempt foreign exchange derivative transaction activity of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. The final rules of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies generally apply to inter-affiliate transactions, with limited relief available from initial margin requirements for affiliates. Under the CFTC final rules, inter-affiliate transactions are exempt from initial margin requirements with certain exceptions but variation margin requirements still apply.  

In December 2016, the CFTC proposed revised capital regulations for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the Federal Reserve Board, as well as a liquidity requirement for those swap dealers. However, many other requirements, including registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of certain swaps, business conduct standards and real-time public trade reporting, have taken effect already under CFTC rules, and the SEC and the CFTC have finalized the definitions of a number of key terms. Finally, the CFTC has begun to decide which swaps must be cleared through central counterparties and executed on swap execution facilities or exchanges. In particular, certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps are now subject to these clearing and trade-execution requirements. The CFTC is expected to continue to make such determinations during 2017. 

The SEC has adopted rules relating to trade reporting and real-time reporting requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The SEC has also adopted final rules relating to the registration of, and application of business conduct standards to, security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, but compliance with such rules is not currently required. The SEC has proposed, but not yet finalized, rules to impose margin, capital and segregation requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The SEC has also proposed rules that would govern the design of new trading venues for security-based swaps and establish the process for determining which products must be traded on these venues.  

We have registered certain subsidiaries as swap dealers under the CFTC rules, including GS&Co., GS Bank USA, GSI and J. Aron & Company. We also expect to register certain subsidiaries as security-based swap dealers.  

Similar regulations have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including the adoption of standardized execution and clearing, margining and reporting requirements for OTC derivatives. For instance, the E.U. has established regulatory requirements for OTC derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, including requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives.  

The CFTC and SEC have issued guidance and rules relating to swap activities. The CFTC has provided guidance and timing on the cross-border regulation of swaps and announced that it had reached an understanding with the European Commission regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the common goals underlying their respective regulations. The CFTC also approved certain comparability determinations that would permit substituted compliance with non-U.S. regulatory regimes for certain swap regulations related to certain business conduct requirements, including chief compliance officer duties, conflict of interest rules, monitoring of position limits, record-keeping and risk management.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

The SEC issued rules and guidance on cross-border security-based swap activities and the CFTC issued rules that determine the circumstances under which registered swap dealers are subject to the CFTCs rules regarding margin in connection with uncleared swaps in cross-border transactions. In particular, certain non-U.S. swap dealers are generally required to comply with the CFTCs rules but, with respect to the requirement to post margin, these non-U.S. swap dealers are permitted to comply with comparable margin requirements in a foreign jurisdiction, subject to the CFTCs approval of the particular jurisdiction. Substituted compliance is also available with respect to the collection of margin in certain circumstances. The CFTCs rules are only applicable to those swap dealers that are not subject to the margin requirements of a prudential regulator.  

In October 2016, the CFTC proposed rules addressing the extent to which swap dealers and major swap participants would be required to comply with the CFTCs business conduct standards in cross-border transactions. The proposal also would determine the circumstances under which U.S. and non-U.S. persons would be required to include their cross-border swap dealing transactions or swap positions in their calculations of the level of activity subject to CFTC jurisdiction for purposes of determining whether they are required to register as either a swap dealer or major swap participant.  

The application of new derivatives rules across different national and regulatory jurisdictions has not yet been fully established and specific determinations of the extent to which regulators in each of the relevant jurisdictions will defer to regulations in other jurisdictions have not yet been completed. The full impact of the various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory developments in this area will not be known with certainty until all the rules are finalized and implemented and market practices and structures develop under the final rules.  

J. Aron & Company is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron & Company is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an exempt holding company under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules. 

In addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities activities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as described under Risk Factors  Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  

Investment Management Regulation  

Our investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds.  

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. The SEC has adopted amendments to the rules that govern SEC-registered money market mutual funds. The amended rules require institutional prime money market funds to value their portfolio securities using market-based factors and to sell and redeem their shares based on a floating net asset value. In addition, the rules allow, in certain circumstances, for the board of directors of money market mutual funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates and also require additional disclosure, reporting and stress testing.  

In October 2016, the SEC also adopted rules relating to liquidity risk management that, among others, require registered open-end funds to adopt and implement liquidity risk management programs, establish a minimum percentage of their net assets that will be invested in highly liquid investments and adopt policies and procedures to address shortfalls in meeting that minimum (applicable only to funds that do not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid), and classify and review the liquidity of their portfolio assets. The rules also permit funds to employ swing pricing, under which the net asset value of a funds shares may be adjusted in order to pass the cost of trading in such shares to purchasing or redeeming shareholders. In addition, the rules require funds to make disclosures relating to their liquidity risk management program and swing pricing policies.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

In December 2015, the SEC also proposed a rule regulating the use of derivatives by registered funds. Under the proposed rule, a registered fund would be required to, among other things, comply with one of two alternative portfolio limitations designed to impose a limit on the total amount of leverage the fund can obtain through derivatives transactions; maintain a minimum amount of qualifying coverage assets (generally limited to cash and cash equivalents) to support payment obligations for each derivative transaction; establish a derivatives risk management program if derivative use meets specified thresholds; and comply with new record-keeping, disclosure and reporting requirements related to its use of derivatives.  

Certain of our European subsidiaries are subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and related regulations, which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of E.U.-based alternative investment managers and the ability of alternative investment fund managers located outside the E.U. to access the E.U. market.  

The E.U. legislative institutions have reached provisional agreement on an E.U. regulation relating to money market funds, including provisions prescribing minimum levels of daily and weekly liquidity, clear labeling of money market funds and internal credit risk assessments. This E.U. regulation is currently expected to be published in the second quarter of 2017 and is expected to apply from early 2018 (subject to transitional provisions).  

Compensation Practices  

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other financial regulatory bodies worldwide. The scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop, and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will evolve over a number of years. 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organizations supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness.  

The FSB has released standards for local regulators to implement certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices. In the E.U., the CRR and CRD IV include compensation provisions designed to implement the FSBs compensation standards. These rules have been implemented by E.U. member states and, among other things, limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of certain employees, including those identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of E.U.-regulated entities, including GSI.  

The E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. These requirements are in addition to the guidance issued by U.S. financial regulators described above and the Dodd-Frank Act provision described below.  

During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Group Inc. and some of its depository institution, broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries). 

     Goldman Sachs 2016 Form 10-K   21 

Table of Contents 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion and further, more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion. The general qualitative requirements include (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping.  

For larger financial institutions, the proposed revised rules would also introduce additional requirements applicable only to senior executive officers and significant risk-takers (as defined in the proposed rules), including (i) limits on performance measures and leverage relating to performance targets; (ii) minimum deferral periods; and (iii) subjecting incentive compensation to possible downward adjustment, forfeiture and clawback.  

In October 2016, the NYDFS issued guidance emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions, including GS Bank USA, must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management, oversight and control.  

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations  

The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain some similar provisions. 

In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and regulators are frequently using enforcement proceedings to define the scope of these laws. The obligation of financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor direct and indirect payments to government officials, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.  

Privacy and Cyber Security Regulation  

Certain of our businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the E.U. or other non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, including the GLB Act, the E.U. Data Protection Directive, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act and the Brazilian Bank Secrecy Law.  

In February 2017, the NYDFS adopted regulations that will, beginning March 1, 2017, require financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. In addition, in October 2016, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on potential enhanced cyber risk management standards for large financial institutions.

Other Regulation  

U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions and other state regulators in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity or its directors, officers or employees. In addition, a number of our other activities require us to obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject to the oversight of various regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct these activities.  

The E.U. is finalizing implementing measures under the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and under a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively, MiFID II). MiFID II will become effective on January 3, 2018. Although the implementing rules and technical standards were largely finalized by the European Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in the second half of 2016, significant legal uncertainty still remains in terms of commodities position limits and several market structure rules. In addition, legal uncertainty will remain until member states finalize their rules transposing MiFID II into their law, which they are required to do by July 2017.  

MiFID II includes extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform and enhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments. In equities, MiFID II introduces volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for trading venues, limits the use of broker-dealer crossing networks and creates a new regime for systematic internalizers, which execute client transactions outside a trading venue.  

Additional controls will be introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms will be required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific limits. Other reforms introduce enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. 

The E.U. and national financial legislators and regulators in the E.U. have proposed or adopted numerous further market reforms that may impact our businesses, including heightened corporate governance standards for financial institutions, rules on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products and rules on indices that are used as benchmarks for financial instruments or funds. In addition, the European Commission, ESMA and the European Banking Authority have announced or are formulating regulatory standards and other measures which will impact our European operations. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.  

The European Commission has published a proposal for a common system of financial transactions tax which would be implemented in certain E.U. member states willing to engage in enhanced cooperation in this area. The proposed financial transactions tax is broad in scope and would apply to transactions in a wide variety of financial instruments and derivatives. The European Commission has also published a draft proposal for structural reform of E.U. banks, which would prohibit certain banks from proprietary trading and would require separating certain trading activities from deposit-taking entities.  

As described above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based upon its underlying risk.

Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  

We have included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and from time to time our management may make, statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may also include statements about the effect of changes to the capital, leverage, liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity rules applicable to banks and bank holding companies, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our businesses and operations, and various legal proceedings, governmental investigations or mortgage-related contingencies as set forth in Notes 27 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as well as statements about the results of our Dodd-Frank Act and firm stress tests, statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, statements about our resolution plan and resolution strategy and their implications for our debtholders and other stakeholders, statements about trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements about our future status, activities or reporting under U.S. or non-U.S. banking and financial regulation and statements about our investment banking transaction backlog.  

By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those described below and in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Statements about our investment banking transaction backlog are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For information about other important factors that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  

We have provided in this filing information regarding the firms capital, liquidity and leverage ratios, including the CET1 ratios under the Advanced and Standardized approaches on a fully phased-in basis, as well as the LCR and the NSFR for the firm and the supplementary leverage ratios for the firm and GS Bank USA. The statements with respect to these ratios are forward-looking statements, based on our current interpretation, expectations and understandings of the relevant regulatory rules, guidance and proposals, and reflect significant assumptions concerning the treatment of various assets and liabilities and the manner in which the ratios are calculated. As a result, the methods used to calculate these ratios may differ, possibly materially, from those used in calculating the firms capital, liquidity and leverage ratios for any future disclosures. The ultimate methods of calculating the ratios will depend on, among other things, implementation guidance or further rulemaking from the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards.
