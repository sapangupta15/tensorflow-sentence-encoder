 Highlights of Operating Results 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Includes termination of Edison Capital's cross border leases.   

Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: settlement of prior year tax liabilities; exit activities, including lease terminations, asset impairments, sale of certain assets, early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing; and non-recurring regulatory or legal proceedings.  

SCE's 2009 core earnings increased from 2008 primarily due to higher operating income associated with the CPUC and FERC 2009 general rate case decisions, partially offset by higher income taxes. In addition, core earnings were favorably impacted from lower than planned financings during the year, primarily from cash received for tax-related timing differences and other benefits.  

63 

Table of Contents 

During 2009, SCE received general rate case decisions from the CPUC and FERC, as follows:   

The CPUC issued a decision in SCE's 2009 GRC, authorizing a $4.83 billion revenue requirement for 2009, an increase of $512 million from SCE's 2008 revenue requirement, effective January 1, 2009. The CPUC also authorized a methodology that would result in an approximate revenue requirement of $5.04 billion in 2010 and $5.25 billion in 2011.   

The FERC approved a settlement to the 2009 rate case effective March 1, 2009. The settlement provides for a transmission revenue requirement of $448 million, an increase of $136 million over the previously authorized amount.  

EMG 2009 core earnings were significantly lower than 2008 primarily due to the following:   

Lower wholesale energy prices reduced revenues from EME's merchant coal-fired generation and trading operations. The effects of the economic recession and mild weather during the summer months contributed to declines in electrical demand for the Northern Illinois and PJM West locations during 2009. Electrical load, calculated from data published by PJM, for these locations declined 5% and 3%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, the price of natural gas, which often serves as the marginal fuel source in the region, declined significantly. The reduction in natural gas prices together with lower electrical demand resulted in significantly lower wholesale energy prices. The average 24-hour PJM real-time price for energy at the Northern Illinois Hub and the PJM West Hub declined to $28.86/MWh and $38.31/MWh, respectively, during 2009 as compared to $49.01/MWh and $68.56/MWh, respectively, during 2008.   

Lower electrical load contributed to decreased transmission congestion in the eastern power grid, thereby resulting in $115 million lower trading income in 2009 as compared to 2008.   

Higher costs were incurred at Midwest Generation to comply with the CAIR annual NOx emission program that began in 2009 and new mercury emission controls. Partially offsetting these higher costs were cost reductions at Midwest Generation and Homer City due in part to the deferral of plant overhaul activities.   

Lower earnings occurred at Edison Capital primarily due to a decline in lease income following the termination of cross border leases, which occurred as part of the Global Settlement with the Internal Revenue Service.  

Consolidated changes in non-core items for Edison International include the following:   

An after-tax loss of $254 million in 2009 resulted from the Global Settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and termination of Edison Capital's cross border leases. The 2009 loss is net of a $19 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of federal interest related to the settlement. The Global Settlement resolved federal tax disputes related to Edison Capital's cross-border, leveraged leases through 2009, and all other outstanding federal tax disputes and affirmative claims of Edison International for tax years 1986 through 2002.   

An after-tax non-cash benefit of $46 million was recorded in 2009 from the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base pursuant to approvals by the CPUC and FERC.

An after-tax charge of $49 million in 2008 from a decision by the CPUC disallowing certain amounts and imposing penalties under its performance-based ratemaking program for the period 1997  2003.  

See "SCE: Results of Operations" for discussion of SCE results of operations, including a comparison of 2008 results to 2007. Also, see "EMG: Results of Operations" for discussion of EMG results of operations, including a comparison of 2008 results to 2007.  

 SCE Capital Program 

SCE's capital program is focused primarily in five areas:   

Upgrading and constructing new transmission lines to expand capacity to utilize renewable energy, including the Tehachapi, Devers-Colorado River and Eldorado-Ivanpah projects;   

Maintaining reliability and expanding capability of SCE's transmission and distribution system;   

Developing and installing up to 250 MW of utility-owned solar photovoltaic generating facilities (generally ranging in size from 1 to 2 MW each) on commercial and industrial rooftops and other space in SCE's service territory;   

Replacing steam generators at San Onofre intended to enable operations until at least the end of its initial license period in 2022; and   

Installing "smart" meters in approximately 5.3 million households and small businesses referred to as Edison SmartConnect.  

SCE plans to utilize much of the cash currently generated from its operations and issuance of additional debt and preferred stock for its capital program. SCE's capital expenditures in 2009 totaled $2.9 billion. SCE projects that capital expenditures will be in the range of $3.3 billion to $4.0 billion in 2010 and that the 2010 - 2014 total capital investment plan will be in the range of $18 billion to $21.5 billion. The rate of actual capital spending will be affected by permitting, regulatory, market and other factors as discussed further under "SCE: Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Investment Plan."  

 Environmental Developments 

     Midwest Generation Environmental Compliance Plans and Costs 

Midwest Generation is subject to various requirements with respect to environmental compliance for the Midwest Generation plants. In 2006, Midwest Generation entered into an agreement with the Illinois EPA, which has been embodied in an Illinois rule called the CPS, to control emission of mercury, NOx and SO2 from its coal-fired plants. During 2008 and 2009, Midwest Generation installed equipment to reduce its mercury emissions. During 2009, Midwest Generation also conducted tests of NOx removal technology based on SNCR and SO2 removal using flue gas desulfurization technology based on dry sodium sorbent injection that may be employed to meet CPS requirements. Based on this testing, Midwest Generation has concluded that installation of SNCR technology on multiple units will meet the NOx  

65 

Table of Contents 

portion of the CPS. Capital expenditures for installation of SNCR technology are expected to be approximately $88 million in 2010 and $70 million in 2011.  

Testing of flue gas desulfurization technology based on injection of dry sodium sorbent demonstrated significant reductions in SO2 emissions when using low-sulfur coal employed by Midwest Generation; however, further analysis and evaluation are required to determine the appropriate method to comply with the SO2 portion of the CPS. Use of flue gas desulfurization technology based on injection of dry sodium sorbent in combination with Midwest Generation's use of low-sulfur coal is expected to require substantially less capital and installation time than dry scrubber technology, but would likely result in higher ongoing operating costs and may consequently result in lower dispatch rates and competitiveness of the plants. Midwest Generation may also combine the use of dry sorbent injection technology with upgrades to its particulate removal systems to meet environmental regulations.  

Midwest Generation does not yet know what specific method of SO2 removal will be used or the total costs that will be incurred to comply with the CPS. Any and a decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the above or other approaches to compliance remains subject to further analysis and evaluation of several factors, including market conditions, regulatory and legislative developments and forecasted capital and operating costs. Due to existing uncertainties about these factors, Midwest Generation may defer final decisions about particular units for the maximum time available. Accordingly, final decisions on whether to install controls, the particular controls that will be installed, and the resulting capital commitments may not occur for up to two years for some of the units and potentially further out for others. Midwest Generation could elect to shut down units when required in order to comply with the SO2 removal requirements of the CPS. Midwest Generation continues to evaluate various scenarios and cannot predict the extent of shutdowns and retrofits or the particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ to comply with CPS.  

 Midwest Generation New Source Review Lawsuit 

In August 2009, the US EPA and the State of Illinois filed a lawsuit against Midwest Generation in Illinois federal court based on claims contained in a 2007 NOV regarding alleged violations of the New Source Performance Standards of the CAA, the CAA's Title V operating permit requirements and applicable opacity and particulate matter standards. Midwest Generation is contesting such claims. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, substantial monetary penalties and an injunction requiring Midwest Generation to install controls sufficient to meet BACT emissions rates as determined by the court at all units subject to the lawsuit. See "Item 3. Legal ProceedingsMidwest Generation New Source Review Lawsuit" for further discussion. Should liability of Midwest Generation be established, remedies ordered by the court could go beyond what is required for compliance with the CPS.  

 Homer City Environmental Issues and Capital Resource Limitations 

Homer City operates SCR equipment on all three units to reduce NOx emissions, operates flue gas desulfurization equipment on Unit 3 to reduce SO2 emissions, and uses coal-cleaning equipment onsite to reduce the ash and sulfur content of raw coal to meet both combustion and environmental requirements. Homer City may be required to install additional  

66 

Table of Contents 

environmental equipment on Unit 1 and Unit 2 to comply with environmental regulations under the CAIR and Pennsylvania mercury regulations. If required, the timing of such compliance remains uncertain. Homer City projects that if flue gas desulfurization equipment becomes required, it would need to make capital commitments for such equipment three to four years in advance of the effectiveness of such requirements. Homer City continues to review technologies available to reduce SO2 and mercury emissions and to monitor developments related to mercury and other environmental regulations. Restrictions under the agreements entered into as part of Homer City's 2001 sale-leaseback transaction could affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, Homer City's ability to incur indebtedness or make capital expenditures. Homer City will have limited ability to obtain additional outside capital for such projects without amending its lease and related agreements. EME is under no contractual or other obligation to provide funding to Homer City.  

 Greenhouse Gas Regulation Developments 

The nature of future environmental regulation and legislation will have a substantial impact on Edison International. Edison International believes that resolution of current uncertainties about the future, through well-balanced and appropriately flexible regulation and legislation, is needed to support the necessary evolution of the electric industry into using cleaner, more efficient infrastructure and to attract the capital ultimately needed for this effort. Legislative, regulatory, and legal developments related to potential controls over greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are ongoing. Actions to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels as well as the cost of purchased power. In the case of utilities, like SCE, these costs are generally borne by customers, whereas the increased costs for competitive generators, like EME, must be recovered through market prices for electricity.  

Recent significant developments include the following:   

Legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions continues to be considered by Congress; however, the timing, content, and potential effects on Edison International and its subsidiaries of any greenhouse gas legislation that may be enacted remain uncertain.   

In December 2009, the US EPA issued a final finding that certain greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, threaten the public health and welfare. The US EPA has issued a proposed rule, known as the "greenhouse gas tailoring rule," under which all new and major modifications of existing stationary sources emitting 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually, including power plants, would be required to include BACT to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions. Since the current proposal affects only new or modified sources, it is not expected to have any immediate effect, if adopted, on existing fossil-fuel generating stations of SCE, Midwest Generation or Homer City, but it could affect the cost of new construction or modifications. US EPA could also use its authority in the future to regulate existing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. If controls are required to be installed at the facilities of Edison International subsidiaries in the future in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to regulations issued by the US EPA or others, the potential impact will depend on the nature of the controls applied, which remains uncertain.  

67 

Table of Contents  

Three recent court cases addressed the question of whether power plants that emit greenhouse gases constituted public nuisances that could be held liable for damages or other remedies. In one case (in which Edison International is a named defendant): a California federal district court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. In the other two, federal courts of appeals permitted the suits to go forward. Each of these differing results remains subject to appeal and thus the ultimate impact of these cases remains uncertain. Edison International cannot predict whether these recent decisions will result in the filing of new actions with similar claims or whether Congress, in considering climate legislation, will address directly the availability of courts for these sorts of claims.   

Governor Schwarzenegger issued an executive order to increase California's renewable energy goals from 20% to 33% and has directed the CARB to adopt a regulation consistent with 33% of retail sellers annual electricity sales being obtained from renewable energy sources by 2020. Achieving a 33% renewables portfolio standard in this timeframe is highly ambitious, given the magnitude of the infrastructure build-out required and the slow pace of transmission permitting and approvals. The CARB is also considering a number of direct regulations to reduce greenhouse gases in California, which requirements could go beyond those ultimately imposed by Congress or the US EPA.  

 Once-Through Cooling 

Last year, the California State Water Resources Board released a draft policy, which would establish closed-cycle wet cooling as required technology for retrofitting existing once-through cooled plants like San Onofre and many of the existing gas-fired power plants along the California coast. If the policy is adopted by the Board, it may result in significant capital expenditures at San Onofre and may affect its operations. It may also significantly impact SCE's ability to procure generating capacity from fossil-fuel plants that use ocean water in once-through cooling systems. It may also impact system reliability and the cost of electricity to the extent other coastal power plants in California are forced to shut down or limit operations. The policy has the potential to adversely affect California's nineteen once-through cooled power plants, which provide over 21,000 MW of combined, in-state generation capacity, including over 9,100 MW of capacity interconnected within SCE's service territory.  

 EME Renewable Program 

EME has a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately 4,000 MW at January 31, 2010 compared to approximately 5,000 MW at December 31, 2008. The decline in the pipeline is primarily due to the transfer of projects into construction and cost containment efforts resulting in the reduction in the number of projects funded under our joint development agreements. EME had purchase contracts for 512 MW of wind turbines for future projects as of December 31, 2009. EME plans to deploy these wind turbines when projects meet acceptable financial thresholds, have long-term power sales agreements, and can attract long-term project financing. If EME is unable to develop such projects on acceptable terms and conditions, certain turbine orders may be terminated. Such an event would likely result in a material charge.  

At December 31, 2009, EME had two projects under construction: the 240 MW Big Sky wind project, and the 150 MW Cedro Hill wind project, which are scheduled for completion in  

68 

Table of Contents 

early 2011 and late 2010, respectively. EME has obtained financing for the Big Sky wind project ($206 million). During the first quarter of 2010, EME commenced construction of the 130 MW Taloga wind project located in Oklahoma and executed a power sales agreement for an 80 MW project located in Nebraska, referred to as the Laredo Ridge wind project. After designating turbines for these projects, EME has reduced its available turbines for future projects to 302 MW.  

The pace of further growth in EME's renewables program will be subject to availability of projects that meet EME's requirements and the capital needed for development, and it may be affected by future decisions about capital expenditures for environmental compliance by its coal fleet.  

 Parent Company Liquidity 

The parent company's liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and dividends to common shareholders have historically been dependent on dividends from SCE, tax-allocation payments under its tax-allocation agreements with its subsidiaries, and access to bank and capital markets. During 2009, Edison International paid common dividends of $404 million to its shareholders. Given its subsidiaries' plans to use their current cash flow for their respective capital needs, Edison International (parent) expects to incur additional borrowings to fund its own activities.  

At December 31, 2009, Edison International (parent) had approximately $18 million of cash and equivalents on hand. The following table summarizes the status of the Edison International (parent) credit facility at December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

Edison International has a debt covenant in its credit facility that requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1 to be met. At December 31, 2009, Edison International's consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.53 to 1.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

SCE's results of operations are derived mainly through two sources:   

Utility earning activities, which mainly represent CPUC and FERC-authorized base rates, which allow a reasonable return, and CPUC-authorized incentive mechanisms; and   

Utility cost-recovery activities, which mainly represent CPUC-authorized balancing accounts, which allow recovery of costs incurred or provide mechanisms to track and recover or refund differences in forecasted and actual amounts. Balancing accounts do not allow for a return.  

Utility earning activities include base rates that are designed to recover forecasted operation and maintenance costs, certain capital-related carrying costs, interest, taxes and a return, including the return on capital projects recovered through balancing account mechanisms. Differences between authorized and actual results impact earnings. Also, included in utility earning activities are revenues or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue, and regulatory charges or disallowances, if any.  

Utility cost-recovery activities include rates which provide for recovery, subject to reasonableness review, of fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs), nuclear decommissioning expense, certain operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation expense related to certain projects. There is no return for cost-recovery expenses.

 Electric Utility Results of Operations 

The following table is a summary of SCE's results of operations for the periods indicated. The presentation below separately identifies utility earning activities and utility cost-recovery activities (including Big 4).  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1SCE has contracts with certain QFs that contain variable contract provisions based on the price of natural gas. Four of these contracts are with entities that are partnerships owned in part by EME. The QFs sell electricity to SCE and steam to nonrelated parties. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance which requires consolidation of certain variable interest entities, SCE consolidates these Big 4 projects. SCE does not derive any income or cash flows from these entities.

 Utility Earning Activities 

     2009 vs. 2008 

Utility earning activities were primarily affected by:   

Higher operating revenue of $514 million primarily due to the following:   

$485 million increase resulting from the implementation of SCE's 2009 CPUC GRC decision, which authorized an increase of $512 million ($27 million of which is reflected in utility cost-recovery activities) from SCE's 2008 revenue requirement effective January 1, 2009.   

$114 million increase resulting from the 2009 FERC approved rate case settlement effective March 1, 2009.   

$85 million decrease primarily due to the revenue requirements for medical, dental, and vision expenses and SCE's share of Palo Verde operation and maintenance expenses, which beginning in 2009 are reflected in utility cost recovery activities.   

In December 2009, the CPUC approved a payment of $26 million (compared to a $25 million payment in 2008) on SCE's 2006-2008 energy efficiency risk/reward incentive mechanism. SCE expects to recognize a final payment of approximately $27 million in 2010. The final payment, if any, may be reduced as a result of the final verification and review of the entire program cycle savings.   

Higher operation and maintenance expenses of $60 million primarily due to:   

$105 million of higher transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to higher costs to support system reliability and infrastructure projects, increases in preventive maintenance work, as well as engineering costs;   

$50 million of higher expenses related to regulatory and performance issues including the NRC requiring SCE to take action to provide greater assurance of compliance by San Onofre personnel with applicable NRC requirements and procedures. SCE is currently implementing plans to address the identified issues (See "Item 1 BusinessRegulationNuclear Power Plant Regulation" for further discussion);   

$50 million of higher expenses associated with new information technology system requirements and facility maintenance to support company growth programs;   

$30 million of higher expenses resulting from the transfer of the Mountainview plant to utility rate base in July 2009, previously recognized in cost-recovery activities; partially offset by   

$175 million of expenses which, beginning in 2009, are recovered through balancing accounts and are reflected in 2009 cost-recovery activities. SCE's 2009 GRC decision authorized balancing account treatment for medical, dental and vision expenses and SCE's share of Palo Verde operations and maintenance expenses.    

72 

Table of Contents  

Higher depreciation expense of $80 million primarily resulting from increased capital investments including capitalized software costs.   

Lower net interest expense and other of $118 million primarily due to:   

Lower other expenses of $71 million primarily due to a final charge of $60 million ($49 million after-tax)recorded in 2008 resulting from the CPUC decision on SCE's PBR mechanism as well as a $14 million decrease in civic, political and related activity expenditures, primarily related to spending on Proposition 7 in 2008, partially offset by a $8 million increase in donations. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 12. Other Income and Expenses" for further detail of other expenses.   

Higher other income of $63 million due to an increase in AFUDC  equity earnings primarily resulting from:   

$50 million increase in AFUDC  equity earnings in the third quarter of 2009 related to the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base. The 2009 CPUC GRC decision granted the authority to transfer the assets and liabilities of Mountainview Power Company, LLC to SCE, which was subsequently approved by the FERC and transferred in July 2009.   

$12 million increase in AFUDC  equity earnings resulting from an increase in construction work in progress related to SCE's capital investment program.        

See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 12. Other Income and Expenses" for further detail of other income.    

Higher interest expense of $8 million primarily due to higher outstanding balances on long-term debt partially offset by lower interest expense on short-term borrowings. Due to an increase in cash flow from operations, including the positive cash impact from the Global Settlement and other tax timing differences, SCE was able to defer some of its expected financings in 2009 to support its growth programs.   

Lower income tax expense primarily due to an interest benefit related to the Global Settlement, partially offset by higher pre-tax income, higher 2008 software deductions resulting from the implementation of SAP, and lower property-related tax benefits in 2009.  

 2008 vs. 2007 

Utility earning activities were primarily affected by:   

Higher operating revenue of $289 million primarily due to rate base related revenue growth, and authorized energy efficiency incentives. SCE recorded $25 million of energy efficiency revenues in 2008 in connection with the energy efficiency risk/reward incentive mechanism.   

Higher operation and maintenance expenses of $154 million primarily due to $60 million of higher generation expenses related to maintenance and refueling outage expenses at San Onofre and higher overhaul and outage costs at Four Corners and Palo Verde and $50 million of higher customer service expenses and administrative and general expenses  

73 

Table of Contents  

primarily related to higher labor costs, increased uncollectible accounts and higher franchise fees and higher maintenance costs.    

Higher depreciation expense of $95 million primarily resulting from increased capital investments, including capitalized software costs, and a $17 million cumulative depreciation rate adjustment recorded in the second quarter of 2008.   

Higher net interest expense and other of $56 million primarily due to:   

Higher other expenses of $79 million primarily due to a final charge of $60 million ($49 million after-tax) recorded in 2008 related to a decision received regarding SCE incentives claimed under a CPUC-approved PBR mechanism. The 2008 variance was also due to an increase of $8 million for civic, political and related activity expenditures primarily related to spending on Proposition 7.   

Higher other income of $24 million primarily due to $10 million of proceeds received for corporate-owned life insurance policies and an $8 million increase in AFUDC  equity earnings resulting from an increase in construction work in progress related to SCE's capital investment program.   

Lower interest expense of $21 million primarily due to lower balancing account over-collections and lower interest rates applied to those over-collections. This decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from higher outstanding balances on long-term debt.   

Lower interest income of $22 million primarily due to lower balancing account under-collections and lower interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offset by higher interest income due to higher cash and equivalents and short-term investment balances.    

 Utility Cost-Recovery Activities 

     2009 vs. 2008 

Utility cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by:   

Lower purchased power expense of $1.1 billion primarily due to: lower bilateral energy and QF purchases of $1.3 billion primarily due to lower natural gas prices and decreased kWh purchases; and lower firm transmission rights costs of $65 million due to implementation of the MRTU market. Realized losses on economic hedging activities were $344 million in 2009 and $60 million in 2008. Changes in realized losses on economic hedging activities were primarily due to settled natural gas prices being significantly lower than average fixed prices.   

Lower fuel expense of $679 million primarily due to lower costs at the Mountainview plant of $230 million and lower costs for the SCE Big 4 projects of $445 million, both resulting from lower natural gas costs in 2009 compared to 2008.   

Higher operation and maintenance expense of $81 million primarily related to $185 million of expenses which beginning in 2009 are recovered through balancing accounts and are reflected in 2009 cost recovery activities. SCE's 2009 GRC decision authorized balancing account treatment for medical, dental, and vision expenses and its share of Palo Verde operation and maintenance expenses. In addition, SCE recorded  

74 

Table of Contents  

higher pension and PBOP expenses of $60 million due to the volatile market conditions experienced in 2008. These increases were partially offset by $50 million of lower energy efficiency costs, $85 million of lower transmission access and reliability service charges and $30 million of lower Mountainview expenses resulting from the transfer of the Mountainview plant to utility rate base in July 2009.   

 2008 vs. 2007 

Utility cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by:   

Higher purchased power expense of $610 million due to: higher bilateral energy and QF purchases of $495 million, primarily due to higher natural gas prices and increased kWh purchases and higher ISO-related energy costs of $165 million. These increases were partially offset by $30 million of lower firm transmission rights costs. Realized losses on economic hedging were $60 million in 2008 and $132 million in 2007. Changes in realized losses on economic hedging activities were primarily due to significant decreases in forward natural gas prices in 2008 compared to 2007.   

Higher fuel expense of $209 million primarily due to higher costs at SCE's Mountainview plant of $85 million and higher costs at SCE's VIEs of $104 million, both resulting from higher natural gas prices in 2008 compared to 2007.  

 Supplemental Operating Revenue Information 

SCE's total consolidated operating revenue was $10 billion, $11.2 billion and $10.2 billion for the year-ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, of which $9.5 billion, $9.3 billion and $9.2 billion related to retail billed and unbilled revenue (excluding wholesale sales) for the same respective periods. In 2009, retail billed and unbilled revenue increased $184 million compared to the same period in 2008. The increase reflects a rate increase (including impact of a tiered rate structure) of $564 million and a sales volume decrease of $380 million. Effective April 4, 2009, SCE's overall system average rate increased to 14.1¢ per-kWh due to the implementation of both revenue allocation and rate design changes authorized in Phase 2 of the 2009 GRC and the FERC transmission rate changes authorized in the 2009 FERC rate case. The sales volume decrease was due to the economic downturn as well as the impact of milder weather experienced in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Retail billed and unbilled revenue increased $94 million in 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. The increase reflects a rate increase (including impact of tiered rate structure) of $92 million and a sales volume increase of $2 million. The rate increase was due to minor variations of usage by rate class.  

Due to warmer weather during the summer months and SCE's rate design, operating revenue during the third quarter of each year is generally higher than other quarters.  

Amounts SCE bills and collects from its customers for electric power purchased and sold by the CDWR to SCE's customers, CDWR bond-related costs and a portion of direct access exit fees are remitted to the CDWR and are not recognized as revenue by SCE. The amounts collected and remitted to CDWR were $1.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

SCE's effective income tax rate was 16.3% in 2009 compared to 31.8% in 2008. The effective tax rate decreased due to 2009 benefits related to both the Global Settlement and recognition of additional AFUDC  equity resulting from the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base. Partially offsetting these items was an increase from higher 2008 software deductions related to the implementation of SAP and lower property-related tax benefits in 2009. The effective tax rate for both periods was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to these items as well as other property related flow-through items and state income expense. The CPUC requires flow-through rate-making treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences, which reverse over time. The accounting treatment for these temporary differences results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to deferred income tax expense.  

SCE's effective income tax rate was 31.8% in 2008 compared to 30.8% in 2007. The 2008 effective tax rate included tax benefits from higher software deductions related to the implementation of SAP. The 2007 effective tax rate included tax benefits from reductions in liabilities for uncertain tax positions to reflect both the progress made in an administrative appeals process with the IRS related to the income tax treatment of certain costs associated with environmental remediation and to reflect a settlement of state tax audit issues. The effective tax rate for both periods was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to these items as well as other property related flow-through items and state income tax expense. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes."  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

SCE's ability to operate its business, complete planned capital projects, and implement its business strategy is dependent upon its cash flow and access to the capital markets to finance its business. SCE's overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, dividend payments made to Edison International, and the outcome of tax and regulatory matters.  

SCE's continuing obligations and projected capital investments, both for 2010, are expected to be funded through cash and equivalents on hand, operating cash flows and incremental capital market financings of debt and preferred equity. SCE expects that it would also be able to draw on the remaining availability of its credit facilities and access capital markets if additional funding and liquidity are necessary to meet operating and capital requirements.  

 Available Liquidity 

As of December 31, 2009, SCE had approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity comprised of cash and equivalents and short-term investments and $2.9 billion available under credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, SCE's long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, was $6.7 billion.

Table of Contents 

The following table summarizes the status of SCE's credit facilities at December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1SCE has two credit facilities with various banks. A $2.4 billion five-year credit facility that matures in February 2013, with four one-year options to extend by mutual consent and a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility terminating on March 16, 2010.   

 Debt Covenant 

SCE has a debt covenant in its credit facilities that limits its debt to total capitalization ratio to less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2009, SCE's debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.45 to 1.  

 Capital Investment Plan 

SCE's capital investment plan for 2010  2014 includes a capital forecast of $21.5 billion. The 2010  2011 planned capital investments for projects under CPUC jurisdiction are recovered through the authorized revenue requirement in SCE's 2009 GRC or through other CPUC-authorized mechanisms. Recovery of planned capital investments for projects under CPUC jurisdiction beyond 2011 and not already approved through other CPUC-authorized mechanisms, is subject to the outcome of future CPUC GRCs or other CPUC approvals. Recovery of the 2010 planned capital investments for projects under FERC jurisdiction has been requested in the 2010 FERC Rate Case. Recovery of the 2011  2014 planned capital investments under FERC jurisdiction will be requested in future FERC transmission filings, as appropriate.  

The completion of the projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, weather and other unforeseen conditions.  

SCE capital investments (including accruals) related to its 2009 capital plan were $2.9 billion. SCE's capital investments for 2009 were approximately 15% less than the original forecast, primarily due to timing delays resulting from a later than expected 2009 GRC decision and delays in other regulatory approvals. The estimated capital investments for the next five years may vary from SCE's current forecast in a range of $18 billion to $21.5 billion based on the average variability experienced in 2008 and 2009 of 16.5%. Applying the two-year historical average variability to the current forecast, the estimated capital investments for the next five years would vary in the range of: 2010  $3.3 billion to $4.0 billion; 2011  $3.7 billion to $4.4 billion; 2012  $3.9 billion to $4.6 billion; 2013  $3.6 billion to $4.3 billion; and 2014 

$3.5 billion to $4.2 billion. SCE's 2009 capital spending and 2010  2014 capital spending forecast is set forth in the following table:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Included in SCE's capital investment plan are projected environmental capital expenditures of $510 million in 2010 and approximately $2.8 billion for the period 2011 through 2014. The projected environmental capital expenditures are to comply with laws, regulations, and other nondiscretionary requirements.   

 Distribution Projects 

Distribution investments include projects and programs to meet customer load growth requirements, reliability and infrastructure replacement needs, information and other technology and related facility requirements for 2010  2014. Of the total investments, $3.8 billion are recovered through rates authorized in SCE's 2009 CPUC GRC decision, and $7.1 billion are subject to review and approval in the 2012 CPUC GRC proceeding.  

 Transmission Projects 

SCE's has planned the following significant transmission projects:   

Tehachapi Transmission Project  An eleven segment project consisting of new and upgraded transmission lines and associated substations built primarily to enable the development of renewable energy generated primarily by wind farms in remote areas of eastern Kern County, California. Tehachapi segments one, two and a portion of segment three were completed and placed in service in 2009. The remainder of segment three is under construction and expected to be placed in service over the period 2011  2013. SCE continues to seek the necessary licensing permits for Tehachapi segments four through eleven, which are expected to be placed in service between 2011 and 2015, subject to receipt of licensing and regulatory approvals. SCE expects to invest $1.7 billion over the period 2010  2014 on this project. In November 2007, the FERC approved a 125 basis point ROE project adder, a 50 basis point incentive for CAISO participation, recovery of the ROE and incentive adders during the CWIP phase, and recovery of abandoned plant costs (if any) on this project. SCE's requested 100% CWIP cost recovery is still pending FERC approval.   

Devers-Colorado River Project  A transmission project, also known as the California portion of the DPV2 project, involving the installation of a high voltage (500 kV) transmission line from Romoland, California to the Colorado River switchyard west of Blythe, California. The project is currently expected to be placed in service in 2013, subject to final licensing and regulatory approvals. Over the period 2010  2014, SCE expects to invest $658 million for this project in California. The DPV2 project includes the transmission line through a portion of western Arizona, although SCE has deferred the Arizona portion while it continues to evaluate its transmission needs in western Arizona.  

78 

Table of Contents  

In November 2007, the FERC approved a 125 basis point ROE project adder, a 50 basis point adder for CAISO participation, recovery of the ROE and incentive adders during the CWIP phase, and recovery of abandoned plant costs (if any) on the DPV2 project. Various parties have challenged SCE's ability to receive the DPV2 incentives.    

Eldorado-Ivanpah Transmission Project  A proposed 220/115 kV substation near Primm, Nevada and an upgrade of a 35-mile portion of an existing transmission line connecting the new substation to the Eldorado Substation, near Boulder City, Nevada. The project is currently expected to be placed in service in 2013, subject to necessary licensing and regulatory approvals. SCE expects to invest $469 million over the period 2010  2014 on this project. In December 2009, the FERC granted conditional approval of incentives on the project which included 100 basis point ROE project adder, a 50 basis point incentive for CAISO participation, recovery of the ROE and incentive adders during the CWIP phase, and recovery of abandoned plant costs (if any) on this project. The approval was conditioned upon the approval of the CAISO and its finding that the project ensures reliability or reduces the cost of delivered power.   

Other capital investments consisting of $2.7 billion for other transmission to maintain reliability and expand capability of its infrastructure over the period 2010  2014. Included in these capital investments are other renewable projects in support of the 33% renewable procurement target.  

 Generation Projects 

San Onofre Steam Generator Replacement Project  In February 2010, SCE installed the first two of the four planned steam generators. San Onofre Unit 2 is expected to be back online in March 2010. The steam generator replacement project is intended to enable San Onofre to operate until the end of its initial license period in 2022, and beyond if license renewal proves feasible. SCE expects to spend $270 million over the period 2010  2011 on this project.  

 EdisonSmartConnectTM 

SCE's EdisonSmartConnectTM project involves installing state-of-the-art "smart" meters in approximately 5.3 million households and small businesses through its service territory. In March 2008, SCE was authorized by the CPUC to recover $1.63 billion in customer rates for the deployment phase of EdisonSmartConnectTM. In 2009, SCE began full deployment of meters to all residential and small business customers under 200 kW and anticipates completion of the deployment in 2012. SCE expects to spend $1.1 billion over the period 2010  2014 on this project, with expenditures in 2013 and 2014 primarily related to post-deployment customer additions.  

 Solar Rooftop Program 

In June 2009, the CPUC approved SCE's Solar Photovoltaic Program to develop up to 250 MW of utility-owned Solar Photovoltaic generating facilities generally ranging in size from 1 to 2 MW each, on commercial and industrial rooftops and other space in SCE's service territory. The decision allows SCE to recover its reasonable costs in customer rates and its CPUC-authorized rate of return on its investment. SCE expects to spend $1.0 billion over the period 2010  2014 on this project.

 Regulatory Proceedings 

     Cost of Capital Mechanism 

In 2009, the CPUC granted SCE's request to forgo an expected 2010 cost of capital increase under the annual adjustment provision and extended SCE's existing capital structure and authorized rate of return of 11.5% through December 2012, absent any future potential annual adjustments. The revised mechanism will be subject to CPUC review in 2012 for the cost of capital set for 2013 and beyond.  

 2010 FERC Rate Case 

On September 30, 2009, FERC issued an order allowing SCE to implement its proposed 2010 rates, subject to refund and settlement procedures, effective March 1, 2010. The proposed rates would increase SCE's revenue requirement by $107 million, or 24%, over the 2009 revenue requirement primarily due to an increase in transmission rate base and would result in an approximate 1% increase to SCE's overall system average rate. SCE is currently in settlement negotiations with the FERC staff and multiple intervenors.  

 Dividend Restrictions 

The CPUC regulates SCE's capital structure and limits the dividends it may pay Edison International. In SCE's most recent cost of capital proceeding, the CPUC set an authorized capital structure for SCE which included a common equity component of 48%. SCE may make distributions to Edison International as long as the common equity component of SCE's capital structure remains at or above the 48% authorized level on a 13-month weighted average basis. At December 31, 2009, SCE's 13-month weighted-average common equity component of total capitalization was 49.8% resulting in the capacity to pay $271 million in additional dividends.  

During 2009, SCE made a total of $300 million of dividend payments to its parent, Edison International and declared a $100 million dividend to Edison International which was paid in January 2010. Future dividend amounts and timing of distributions are dependent upon several factors including the actual level of capital investments, operating cash flows and earnings.  

 Income Tax Matters 

SCE is included in the consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns of Edison International and participates in tax-allocation payments with other subsidiaries of Edison International in accordance with the terms of intercompany tax allocation agreements among the Edison International affiliated companies. Significant activities occurred during 2009 that will have an impact on SCE's future cash flows.  

 Global Settlement 

On May 5, 2009, Edison International and the IRS finalized the terms of a Global Settlement that resolved all of SCE's federal income tax disputes and affirmative claims through tax year 2002. See "Edison International Parent and OtherLiquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion.

Table of Contents 

 Repair Deductions 

During the fourth quarter of 2009, Edison International made a voluntary election to change its tax accounting method for certain repair costs incurred on SCE's transmission, distribution and generation assets. The change in tax accounting method resulted in an initial $192 million cash benefit realized in the fourth quarter of 2009. This benefit was based primarily on an estimated cumulative catch-up deduction for certain repair costs that were previously capitalized and depreciated over the tax depreciable life of the property. Additional information and analysis is required to determine the actual deduction that will ultimately be reflected on the 2009 income tax return (due to be filed in September 2010) which may result in additional cash benefits. The current income tax benefit from the change in accounting for repair costs represents a timing difference which will reverse over the remaining tax life of the assets. This method change did not impact SCE's 2009 results of operations. Recovery of the future increase in income taxes related to this matter is expected to be addressed in SCE's 2012 GRC. Due to the uncertainty over this recovery, SCE did not recognize an earnings benefit or regulatory asset in 2009.  

 Margin and Collateral Deposits 

Certain derivative instruments and power procurement contracts under SCE's power and natural gas hedging activities contain collateral requirements. SCE has historically provided collateral in the form of cash and/or letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties. Collateral requirements can vary depending upon the level of unsecured credit extended by counterparties, changes in market prices relative to contractual commitments, and other factors. Future collateral requirements may be higher (or lower) than requirements at December 31, 2009, due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on SCE's contractual obligations.  

Certain of these power contracts contain a provision that requires SCE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. If SCE's credit rating were to fall below investment grade, SCE may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral. The table below illustrates the amount of collateral posted by SCE to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of December 31, 2009.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Collateral posted consisted of $6 million in cash reflected in "Margin and collateral deposits" on the consolidated balance sheets and $12 million in letters of credit. 

2Total posted and potential collateral requirements may increase by an additional $62 million, based on SCE's forward position as of December 31, 2009, due to adverse market price movements over the remaining life of the existing contracts using a 95% confidence level.   

81 

 Table of Contents  

In the table above, there was zero collateral posted as of December 31, 2009 related to derivative liabilities, and $4 million of incremental collateral requirements related to derivative liabilities.  

SCE's incremental collateral requirements are expected to be met from liquidity available from cash on hand and available capacity under SCE's credit facilities, discussed above.  

 Historical Consolidated Cash Flow 

The section of the MD&A discusses consolidated cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities.  

 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 

The $2.4 billion increase in 2009 cash flows provided by operating activities over 2008 was primarily due to the following:   

$875 million cash inflow due to the receipt of tax-allocation payments due to Global Settlement related to the settlement of affirmative claims; a portion of which is timing and will be payable in future periods (See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes" for further discussion).   

$468 million net cash inflow due to the increase in balancing account cash flows comprised of:   

$1.3 billion net cash inflow due to the increase in ERRA balancing account cash flows (collections of approximately $450 million in 2009, compared to refunds of approximately $840 million in 2008). The ERRA balancing account was over-collected by $46 million, under-collected by $406 million and over-collected by $433 million at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively; partially offset by   

$820 million net cash outflow related to all other regulatory balancing accounts which was primarily due to increased spending in 2009 compared to 2008 for public purpose and solar initiative programs and increased pension and PBOP contributions. In addition, a $200 million refund payment was received in 2008 related to public purpose programs.   

$250 million cash inflow benefit related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 50% bonus depreciation provision.   

$192 million cash inflow benefit related to the change in its tax accounting method for certain repair costs incurred on SCE's transmission, distribution and generation assets.  

82 

Table of Contents  

Higher cash inflow due to the increase in pre-tax income primarily driven by higher authorized revenue requirements resulting from the implementation of the 2009 CPUC and FERC GRC decisions.   

Timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to working capital items.  

The $1.3 billion decrease in 2008 cash flows provided by operating activities over 2007 was primarily due to the following:   

$295 million net cash outflow due to the decrease in balancing account cash flows comprised of:   

$745 million net cash outflow due to the decrease in ERRA balancing account cash flows (refunds of approximately $840 million in 2008, compared to refunds of approximately $95 million in 2007). The ERRA balancing account was under-collected by $406 million, over-collected by $433 million and over-collected by $526 million at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively; partially offset by   

$450 million net cash inflow related to all other regulatory balancing accounts which was primarily due a $200 million refund payment received in 2008 related to public purpose programs, $100 million refunded to ratepayers as a result of SCE's PBR decision, and a net $150 million in other balancing account overcollections.   

$240 million cash outflow due to the elimination of amounts collected in 2008 for the repayment of SCE rate reduction bonds. These bonds were fully repaid in December 2007. The bond payment is reflected in financing activities.   

Timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to working capital items, including tax-related items.  

 Cash Flows Provided (Used) by Financing Activities 

Cash provided (used) by financing activities mainly consisted of net repayments of short-term debt and long-term debt issuances (payments).  

Cash used by financing activities for 2009 was $2.0 billion consisting of the following significant events:   

Repaid a net $1.9 billion of short-term debt, primarily due to the improvement in economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008.   

Paid $300 million in dividends to Edison International.   

Purchased $219 million of two issues of tax-exempt pollution control bonds and converted the issues to a variable rate structure. SCE continues to hold the bonds which remain outstanding and have not been retired or cancelled.   

Repaid $150 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds.   

Issued $500 million of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2039 and $250 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2014. The bond proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to finance fuel inventories.  

83 

Table of Contents 

Cash provided by financing activities for 2008 was $2.0 billion consisting of the following significant events:   

Borrowed $1.4 billion under the line of credit to increase SCE's cash position to meet working capital requirements, if needed, during uncertainty over economic conditions during the second half of 2008.   

Issued $600 million of first refunding mortgage bonds due in 2038. The proceeds were used to repay SCE's outstanding commercial paper of approximately $426 million and for general corporate purposes.   

Issued $500 million of 5.75% first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2014. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.   

Issued $400 million of 5.50% first and refunding mortgage bonds due in 2018. The proceeds were used to repay SCE's outstanding commercial paper of approximately $110 million and borrowings under the credit facility of $200 million, as well as for general corporate purposes.   

Paid $325 million in dividends to Edison International.   

Purchased $212 million of its auction rate bonds, converted the issue to a variable rate structure, and terminated the FGIC insurance policy. SCE continues to hold the bonds which remain outstanding and have not been retired or cancelled.   

Paid $36 million for the purchase and delivery of outstanding common stock for settlement of stock based awards (facilitated by a third party).  

Cash used by financing activities in 2007 was $438 million consisting of the following significant events:   

Repaid $246 million of the remaining outstanding balance of its rate reduction bonds.   

Paid $135 million in dividends to Edison International.   

Paid $135 million for the purchase and delivery of outstanding common stock for settlement of stock based awards (facilitated by a third party).   

Issued $500 million of short-term debt to fund interim working capital requirements.  

 Net Cash Used by Investing Activities 

Cash flows from investing activities are driven primarily by capital expenditures and funding of nuclear decommissioning trusts. Capital expenditures were $3.0 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.3 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily related to transmission and distribution investments. Net purchases of nuclear decommissioning trust investments and other were $199 million, $7 million and $133 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

 Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 

     Contractual Obligations 

SCE's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, for the years 2010 through 2014 and thereafter are estimated below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3. Liabilities and Lines of Credit." Amount includes interest payments totaling $7 billion over applicable period of the debt. 

2At December 31, 2009, minimum operating lease payments were primarily related to power contracts, vehicles, office space and other equipment. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies." 

3At December 31, 2009, minimum capital lease payments were primarily related to power purchased contracts that meet the requirements for capital leases. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies." 

4For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies." 

5Amount includes estimated contributions to the pension and PBOP plans. The estimated contributions for SCE are not available beyond 2010. Due to the volatile market conditions experienced in 2008 and the decline in value of SCE's trusts, SCE's contributions increased in 2009. Based on pension and PBOP plan assets at December 31, 2009 SCE expects a decrease in contributions in 2010 but cannot predict or estimate contributions beyond 2010. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 5. Compensation and Benefit Plans" for further information. 

6At December 31, 2009, SCE had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $458 million, which is excluded from the table. SCE cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the IRS. 

7The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 8. Property and Plant," respectively.   

 Contingencies 

SCE has contingencies related to FERC transmission incentives and CWIP proceedings, the Navajo Nation Litigation, nuclear insurance, and spent nuclear fuel, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies."  

85 

Table of Contents 

 Environmental Remediation 

SCE records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and/or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated. SCE reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly, by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. These estimates include costs for site investigations, remediation, operations and maintenance, monitoring and site closure. Unless there is a probable amount, SCE records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs (classified as "Other long-term liabilities") at undiscounted amounts.  

As of December 31, 2009, SCE identified 23 sites for remediation and recorded an estimated minimum liability of $39 million of which $5 million was related to San Onofre. SCE expects to recover 90% of its remediation costs at certain sites. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion.  

 MARKET RISK EXPOSURES 

SCE's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and volumes, and counterparty credit. Fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows. Fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows, but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms. SCE uses derivative financial instruments, as appropriate, to manage its market risks.  

 Interest Rate Risk 

SCE is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short-term investing activities used for liquidity purposes, to fund business operations and to fund capital investments. The nature and amount of SCE's long-term and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. In addition, SCE's authorized return on common equity (11.5% for 2010, 2009 and 2008), which is established in SCE's cost of capital proceeding, is set on the basis of forecasts of interest rates and other factors. Variances in actual financing costs compared to authorized financing costs impact earnings either positively or negatively.  

At December 31, 2009, the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) was $7.2 billion, compared to a carrying value of $6.7 billion. A 10% increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a $345 million decrease in the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt. A 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a $380 million increase in the fair market value of SCE's long-term debt.  

 Commodity Price Risk 

SCE is exposed to commodity price risk which represents the potential impact that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular commodity. SCE's hedging program  

86 

Table of Contents 

reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices related to SCE's power and gas activities. SCE recovers its related hedging costs, through the ERRA balancing account, subject to reasonableness review, and as a result, exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings, but may impact cash flows.  

Electricity price exposure arises from the following activities:   

Energy purchased and sold in the MRTU market as a result of differences between SCE's load requirements versus the amount of energy delivered from SCE's generating facilities, existing bilateral contracts, and CDWR contracts allocated to SCE. In March 2009, SCE began participating in the MRTU day-ahead and real-time markets which uses nodal locational marginal prices and is subject to price caps. The volume purchased in the MRTU market may vary due to outages at SCE's generating facilities, new or expired bilateral contracts and changes in customer demand resulting from, among other things, growth or decline in customer base and weather.  

Natural gas price exposure arises from the following activities:   

Natural gas purchased for generation at Mountainview and peaker plants. The volume purchased may vary due to outages and dispatch based on SCE's management of its load requirements.   

Bilateral contracts where pricing is based on natural gas prices. Contract energy prices for some QFs are based on the monthly index price of natural gas delivered at the Southern California border. Approximately 37% of SCE's purchased power supply is subject to natural gas price volatility.   

Power contracts in which SCE has agreed to provide the natural gas needed for generation, referred to as tolling arrangements. Volume may vary due to dispatch based on SCE's management of its load requirements or if the existing CDWR power contracts, which have related natural gas supply contracts, are novated or replaced and SCE becomes a party to such contracts. SCE is currently unable to predict which or how many existing CDWR contracts will be novated or replaced. However, due to the expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms these power procurement expenses are not expected to affect earnings.  

 Natural Gas and Electricity Price Risk 

SCE's hedging program reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices. As part of this program, SCE enters into energy options, swaps, forward arrangements, tolling arrangements, and congestion revenue rights (CRRs). The transactions are pre-approved by the CPUC or executed in compliance with CPUC-approved procurement plans. In addition, SCE's risk management committee monitors exposure related to these instruments.  

SCE records its derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless they meet the definition of a normal purchase or sale or are classified as VIEs or leases. The derivative instrument fair values are marked to market at each reporting period. Any fair value changes are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and therefore, SCE's fair value changes have no impact on purchased-power expense or earnings. SCE does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment.

 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 

SCE follows the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements. For further discussion see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 10. Fair Value Measurements." The following table summarizes the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments used at SCE to mitigate its exposure to spot market prices:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The CAISO created a commodity, CRRs, which entitles the holder to receive (or pay) the value to transmission congestion between specific nodes, acting as an economic hedge against transmission congestion charges. In September 2007 and November 2008, the CAISO allocated CRRs for the period April 2009 through December 2017 based on SCE's load requirements. In addition, SCE participated in CAISO auctions for the procurement of additional CRRs. The CRRs meet the definition of a derivative. 

2In compliance with a CPUC mandate, SCE held an open, competitive solicitation that produced agreements with different project developers who have agreed to construct new southern California generating resources. The contracts provide for fixed capacity payments as well as pricing for energy delivered based on a heat rate and contractual operation and maintenance prices. However, due to uncertainty regarding the availability of required emission credits, some of the generating resources may not be constructed and the contracts associated with these resources could therefore terminate, at which time SCE would no longer account for these contracts as derivatives.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Due to regulatory mechanisms, SCE's realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.   

SCE recognizes realized gains and losses on derivative instruments as purchased power expense and recovers these costs from ratepayers. As a result, realized gains and losses do not affect earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows. Due to expected future recovery from ratepayers, unrealized gains and losses are deferred and are not recognized as purchased power expense, and therefore do not affect earnings. Realized losses on economic hedging activities were primarily due to settled natural gas prices being significantly lower than transactional average fixed prices. Unrealized gains on economic hedging activities were primarily due to changes in the expected forward prices of the CRRs, the rising volatilities related to SCE's contracts from the new generation contracts, and settlement of gas contracts during the period.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Credit Risk 

As part of SCE's procurement activities, SCE contracts with a number of utilities, energy companies, financial institutions, and other companies, collectively referred to as counterparties. If a counterparty were to default on its contractual obligations, SCE could be exposed to potentially volatile spot markets for buying replacement power or selling excess power. In addition, SCE would be exposed to the risk of non-payment of accounts receivable, primarily related to sales of excess energy and realized gains on derivative instruments. However, all of the contracts that SCE has entered into with counterparties are either entered into under SCE's short-term or long-term procurement plan which has been approved by the CPUC, or the contracts are approved by the CPUC before becoming effective. As a result of regulatory recovery mechanisms, losses from non-performance are not expected to affect earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows.  

To manage credit risk, SCE looks at the risk of a potential default by counterparties. Credit risk is measured by the loss that would be incurred if counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. SCE measures, monitors and mitigates credit risk to the extent possible. SCE manages the credit risk on the portfolio based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings, and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements. SCE's risk management committee regularly reviews and evaluates procurement credit exposure and approves credit limits for transacting with counterparties. Despite this, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be wholly successful in mitigating credit risk or that collateral pledged will be adequate. SCE anticipates future delivery of energy by counterparties, but given the current market condition, SCE cannot predict whether the counterparties will be able to continue operations and deliver energy under the contractual agreements.  

The credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets (derivative assets less derivative liabilities) reflected on the balance sheet. SCE enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff. Accordingly, SCE's credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements.  

89 

Table of Contents 

As of December 31, 2009, the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above, broken down by the credit ratings of SCE's counterparties, was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1SCE assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty's S&P or Moody's rating. For ease of reference, the above table uses the S&P classifications to summarize risk, but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings. 

2Exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non- derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, except for any related net accounts receivable.   

The credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is comprised of $7 million of net account receivables and $299 million representing the fair value, adjusted for counterparty credit reserves, of derivative contracts.  

The CAISO comprises 72% of the total net exposure above and is mainly related to the CRRs' fair value (see "Commodity Price Risk" for further information).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

The following table reconciles AOI to operating income as reflected on EME's consolidated statements of income.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1AOI is equal to operating income under GAAP, plus equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expenses, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Production tax credits are recognized as wind energy is generated based on a per-kilowatt-hour rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. AOI is a non-GAAP performance measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, dividend income from projects, production tax credits, other income and expenses, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in AOI is meaningful for investors as these components are integral to the operating results of EME.

 Adjusted Operating Income from Consolidated Operations 

     Midwest Generation Plants 

The following table presents additional data for the Midwest Generation plants:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Included in fuel costs were $63 million, $5 million and $5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the net cost of emission allowances. Midwest Generation purchased NOx emission allowances from Homer City at fair market value. Purchases were $1 million and $0.4 million in 2009 and 2007, respectively. There were no purchases in 2008. For more information regarding the price of emission allowances, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price RiskEmission Allowances Price Risk." 

2Midwest Generation sold excess SO2 emission allowances to Homer City at fair market value. Sales to Homer City were $2 million in 2008 and $21 million in 2007. There were no sales in 2009. These sales reduced operating expenses. Midwest Generation recorded $3 million of intercompany profit during 2008 consisting of $1 million and $2 million on emission allowances sold by Midwest Generation to Homer City during the first quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2007, respectively, but not yet used by Homer City until the second quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2008, respectively. In addition, Midwest Generation recorded $4 million of intercompany profit during 2007 that was eliminated by Midwest Generation in 2006 on emission allowances sold by Midwest Generation to Homer City in the fourth quarter of 2006 but not used by Homer City until the first quarter of 2007.   

AOI from the Midwest Generation plants decreased $348 million in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased $105 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The 2009 decrease in AOI was  

94 

Table of Contents 

primarily attributable to a decline in realized gross margin, partially offset by an increase in unrealized gains related to hedge contracts (described below), and lower plant operations expense. The decline in realized gross margin was primarily due to a 21% decline in average realized energy prices resulting from lower energy prices and higher fuel costs to comply with the CAIR annual NOx emission program that began in 2009 and to implement new mercury emission controls. This decline was partially offset by higher capacity revenue primarily due to higher capacity prices from the RPM auctions. Plant operations expense was lower in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to cost containment efforts and the deferral of plant overhaul activities.  

The 2008 increase in AOI was primarily attributable to higher realized gross margin, an increase in unrealized gains related to hedge contracts (described below) and a $15 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2008 related to a buyout of a fuel contract. The increase in realized gross margin was due to an increase in capacity prices as a result of the RPM auctions. The increase in generation and slightly higher average realized energy prices was partially offset by higher coal and transportation costs.  

Included in operating revenues were unrealized gains (losses) of $30 million, $(6) million and $(25) million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Unrealized gains in 2009 were primarily due to hedge contracts that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges (referred to as economic hedges). In addition, $14 million was reversed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in 2009 related to the power contracts with Lehman Brothers Commodity Services, Inc. Unrealized losses in 2008 included a $24 million write-down of power contracts with Lehman Brothers Commodity Services, Inc. for 2009 and 2010 generation. These contracts qualified as cash flow hedges until EME dedesignated the contracts due to nonperformance risk and subsequently terminated the contracts. The change in fair value was recorded as an unrealized loss during 2008. In addition, unrealized gains (losses) included the ineffective portion of hedge contracts at the Midwest Generation plants attributable to changes in the difference between energy prices at NiHub (the settlement point under forward contracts) and the energy prices at the Midwest Generation plants busbars (the delivery point where power generated by the Midwest Generation plants is delivered into the transmission system) resulting from marginal losses. Unrealized losses in 2007 were also attributable to energy contracts that were entered into to hedge the price risk related to projected sales of power. During 2007, power prices increased resulting in mark-to-market losses on economic hedges.  

Included in fuel expenses were unrealized gains of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to oil futures contracts that were accounted for as economic hedges. The contracts were entered into in 2009 to hedge a portion of a fuel adjustment provision of a rail transportation contract. For more information regarding forward market prices and unrealized gains (losses), see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price Risk" and "EMG: Results of OperationsAccounting for Derivative Instruments," respectively.

 Homer City 

The following table presents additional data for the Homer City facilities:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Included in fuel costs were $16 million, $20 million and $31 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the net cost of emission allowances. Homer City purchased SO2 emission allowances from Midwest Generation at fair market value. Purchases were $2 million in 2008 and $21 million in 2007. There were no purchases in 2009. For more information regarding the price of emission allowances, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price RiskEmission Allowances Price Risk."   

AOI from the Homer City facilities decreased $16 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and $19 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The 2009 decrease in AOI was primarily attributable to a decline in realized gross margin partially offset by lower plant operations expense. The decline in realized gross margin was primarily due to a 13% decline in average realized energy prices, partially offset by an increase in capacity revenues and lower coal costs. The decline in plant operations expense was due to cost containment efforts and the deferral of plant overhaul activities.  

The 2008 decrease in AOI compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to lower realized gross margin and higher plant maintenance expenses, partially offset by an increase in unrealized gains related to hedge contracts (described below). The decline in realized gross margin was due to lower generation from higher forced outages, lower off-peak dispatch and extended planned overhauls in 2008, partially offset by an increase in capacity revenues and the sale of excess coal inventory.  

Included in operating revenues were unrealized gains (losses) from hedge activities of $15 million, $21 million and $(10) million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Unrealized gains (losses) were primarily attributable to the ineffective portion of forward and futures contracts which are derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges. The ineffective portion of  

96 

Table of Contents 

hedge contracts at Homer City was attributable to changes in the difference between energy prices at PJM West Hub (the settlement point under forward contracts) and the energy prices at the Homer City busbar (the delivery point where power generated by the Homer City facilities is delivered into the transmission system). For more information regarding forward market prices and unrealized gains (losses), see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price Risk" and "EMG: Results of OperationsAccounting for Derivative Instruments," respectively.  

 Non-GAAP DisclosuresFossil-Fueled Facilities 

    Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) 

AOI is equal to operating income plus other income (expense) for the fossil-fueled facilities. AOI is a non-GAAP performance measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of other income (expense) is meaningful for investors as the components of other income (expense) are integral to the results of the fossil-fueled facilities.  

 Seasonal DisclosureFossil-Fueled Facilities 

In 2009, the seasonal fluctuations in electric demand normally occurring for the fossil-fueled facilities were minimized by milder winter conditions and cooler than normal summer months. Normally, due to fluctuations in electric demand resulting from warmer weather during the summer months and cold weather during the winter months, electric revenues from the fossil-fueled facilities vary substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, maintenance outages generally are scheduled during periods of lower projected electric demand (spring and fall) further reducing generation and increasing major maintenance costs which are recorded as an expense when incurred. Accordingly, AOI from the fossil-fueled facilities are seasonal and have significant variability from quarter to quarter. Seasonal fluctuations may also be affected by changes in market prices. For further discussion regarding market prices, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price RiskEnergy Price Risk Affecting Sales from the Fossil-Fueled Facilities."

 Renewable Energy Projects 

The following table presents additional data for EME's renewable energy projects:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1AOI is equal to operating income (loss) plus production tax credits, other income and expense, and net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Production tax credits are recognized as wind energy is generated based upon a per-kilowatt-hour rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Under GAAP, production tax credits generated by wind projects are recorded as a reduction in income taxes. Accordingly, AOI represents a non-GAAP performance measure which may not be comparable to those of other companies. Management believes that inclusion of production tax credits in AOI for wind projects is meaningful for investors as federal and state subsidies are an integral part of the economics of these projects. The following table reconciles AOI as shown above to operating income (loss) under GAAP:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

AOI from renewable energy projects decreased $7 million in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased $29 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The 2009 decrease in AOI was primarily attributable to mild wind conditions, which reduced the revenue increases relative to the increased operating costs associated with additional projects coming on line. Expenses incurred for projects under construction also contributed to the decrease in AOI. New projects that commenced operations were the primary drivers for increases in the revenues and operating costs and AOI in 2008. EME's share of installed capacity of new wind projects that commenced operations during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 223 MW, 396 MW and 292 MW, respectively.

 Energy Trading 

EME seeks to generate profit by utilizing its subsidiary, EMMT, to engage in trading activities in those markets in which it is active as a result of its management of the merchant power plants of Midwest Generation and Homer City. EMMT trades power, fuel, and transmission congestion primarily in the eastern U.S. power grid using products available over the counter, through exchanges, and from ISOs. AOI from energy trading activities decreased $115 million in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased $22 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The 2009 decrease in AOI from energy trading activities was attributable to lower transmission congestion in the eastern U.S. power grid. The 2008 increase in AOI from energy trading activities was primarily attributable to increased transmission congestion and market volatility in key markets. In addition, energy trading included favorable results for load service transactions in 2009 and 2008.  

 Adjusted Operating Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates 

     Big 4 Projects 

AOI from the Big 4 projects decreased $41 million in 2009 compared to 2008, and $60 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The 2009 decrease in AOI was primarily due to lower natural gas prices affecting electricity and steam revenues. The 2008 decrease in AOI was primarily due to $60 million in lower AOI from the Sycamore and Watson projects as a result of lower pricing in 2008 than previously applied under a long-term power sales agreement that expired.  

 Sunrise 

AOI from the Sunrise project increased $13 million in 2009 from 2008 and decreased $9 million in 2008 from 2007. The 2009 increase was primarily due to higher availability incentive payments in 2009 and lower maintenance expenses. The 2008 decrease was primarily due to lower availability incentive payments in 2008 and higher maintenance expenses due to unplanned outages in 2008.  

 March Point 

In 2009, EME recommenced recording its share of equity in income from the March Point project and recorded $11 million for the year. Although EME's investment in the project was determined to be fully impaired in 2005, declining natural gas prices reduced fuel expenses and returned the project to profitability. To the extent that cash is received from the project in excess of EME's investment, such amount will be included in equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates on EME's consolidated statements of income. In February 2010, EME received an $18 million equity distribution from the March Point project. EME subsequently sold its ownership interest in the March Point project to its partner.  

 Seasonal DisclosureUnconsolidated Affiliates 

EME's third quarter equity in income from its unconsolidated energy projects is normally higher than equity in income related to other quarters of the year due to seasonal fluctuations and higher energy contract prices during the summer months.

 Other Operating Income (Expense) 

Other operating income (expense) in 2009 included a small gain on the sale of a portion of EME's solar project development pipeline, offset by a write-down of capitalized costs related to a development project during the fourth quarter of 2009. Other operating income (expense) in 2008 resulted from a charge of $23 million related to the termination of a turbine supply agreement in connection with the Walnut Creek project and a $7 million write-down of capitalized costs related to U.S. Wind Force. These amounts are reflected in "Gain on buyout of contract, loss on termination of contract, asset write-down and other charges and credits" on EME's consolidated statements of income.  

 Interest Related Income (Expense) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1In June 2009, a subsidiary of EME, Viento Funding II, Inc., completed a non-recourse financing of EME's interests in the Wildorado, San Juan Mesa and Elkhorn Ridge wind projects.   

Interest income decreased $19 million in 2009 from 2008 and $59 million in 2008 from 2007. The 2009 decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2008 decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates in 2008, compared to 2007, and lower average cash equivalents and short-term investment balances.  

EME's interest expense to third parties, before capitalized interest, increased $4 million in 2009 from 2008 and $14 million in 2008 from 2007. The 2009 increase was primarily due to higher debt balances under EME's credit facility in 2009, compared to 2008, and EME's wind financing in June 2009. The 2008 increase primarily resulted from EME's refinancing activities in May 2007.  

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $241 million in 2007 related to the early repayment of EME's 7.73% senior notes due June 15, 2009 and Midwest Generation's 8.75% second priority senior secured notes due May 1, 2034 and MEHC's 13.5% senior secured notes due July 15, 2008.

 Income Taxes 

Competitive power generation (including MEHC) effective tax rates were 5%, 33% and 34%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by lower pretax income in relation to the level of production tax credits and estimated state income tax benefits allocated from Edison International. Production tax credits for wind projects of $56 million, $44 million and $29 million were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Estimated state income tax benefits allocated from Edison International of $15 million, $5 million and $10 million were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes."  

In May 2009, Edison International and the Internal Revenue Service completed a settlement of federal tax disputes and affirmative claims for open tax years 1986 through 2002. As a result, state tax years for the same periods are now open pending review by state taxing authorities of agreed final federal adjustments. The settlement includes the resolution of issues pertaining to EME which were largely timing in nature. During the second quarter of 2009, EME recorded an income tax benefit of $6 million due to the settlement and related estimated impact of interest and state income taxes. The amount recorded is subject to change based on the final determination of interest and state taxes and items affected under the tax-allocation agreement.  

 Results of Discontinued Operations 

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $8 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Results in 2009 and 2008 included foreign exchange gains (losses) and interest expense associated with contract indemnities related to EME's sale of international projects in December 2004. In addition, EME increased its estimated liability for a tax indemnity by $6 million during the second quarter of 2009.  

 Related-Party Transactions 

EME owns interests in partnerships that sold electricity generated by their project facilities to SCE and others under the terms of power purchase agreements. Sales by these partnerships to SCE under these agreements amounted to $366 million, $686 million and $747 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Accounting for Derivative Instruments 

EME uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from fluctuations in the prices of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. For derivative instruments recorded at fair value, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings at the end of each accounting period unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. For derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, changes in their fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item settles and is recognized in earnings. However, the ineffective portion of a derivative that qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting is recognized currently in earnings.  

101 

 Table of Contents  

EME classifies unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments as part of operating revenues or fuel expenses. The results of derivative activities are recorded as part of cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table summarizes unrealized gains (losses) from non-trading activities for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

At December 31, 2009, unrealized gains of $47 million were recognized from non-qualifying hedge contracts or the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges related to subsequent periods ($40 million for 2010 and $7 million for 2011).  

 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 

In determining the fair value of EME's derivative positions, EME uses third-party market pricing where available. For further explanation of the fair value hierarchy and a discussion of EME's derivative instruments, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 10. Fair Value Measurements" and "Note 2. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," respectively.  

 Non-Trading Derivative Instruments 

The fair value of outstanding non-trading commodity derivative instruments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $215 million and $375 million, respectively. In assessing the fair value of EME's non-trading commodity derivative instruments, EME uses quoted market prices and forward market prices adjusted for credit risk. The fair value of commodity price contracts takes into account quoted market prices, time value of money, volatility of the underlying commodities and other factors. The decrease in the fair value of commodity contracts at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008 is attributable to the settlement of contracts in 2009 that were entered into in 2008 at higher prices than contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009. A 10% change in the market price of the underlying commodity at December 31, 2009 would increase or decrease the fair value of outstanding non-trading commodity derivative instruments by approximately $102 million. Since these non-trading commodity derivative instruments are economic hedges, an increase or decrease in fair value would be offset by an increase or decrease in the cash flows of the underlying asset. The change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in cash flows from the economically hedged item may not be recognized in operating revenues in the same periods.

 Energy Trading Derivative Instruments 

The fair value of outstanding energy trading derivative instruments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $122 million and $112 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of trading contracts for the year ended December 31, 2009 was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

A 10% change in the market price of the underlying commodity at December 31, 2009 would increase or decrease the fair value of trading contracts by approximately $1 million. The impact of changes to the various inputs used to determine the fair value of Level 3 derivatives would not be anticipated to be material to EME's results of operations as such changes would be offset by similar changes in derivatives classified within Level 3 as well as other categories.

 Financial Services and Other (Edison Capital and other EMG subsidiaries) Results of Operations 

The following table sets forth the major changes in financial services and other net income (loss):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Lease Termination and Other 

Pursuant to the Global Settlement with the IRS, Edison Capital terminated its interests in cross-border leases during the first half of 2009 (see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes" for further discussion). The net proceeds and loss, before income tax, from termination of the cross-border leases were $1.385 billion and $920 million, respectively. The after-tax loss on termination of the cross-border leases, including the federal and state income tax impact of the Global Settlement, was $614 million. In addition, Edison Capital sold its interest in another leverage lease transaction, Midland Cogeneration Ventures, during the second quarter of 2009 and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $33 million ($20 million after tax).  

In March 2008, First Energy exercised an early buyout right under the terms of an existing lease agreement with Edison Capital related to Unit No. 2 of the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Plant. The termination date of the lease under the early buyout option was June 1,  

104 

Table of Contents 

2008. Proceeds from the sale were $72 million. Edison Capital recorded a pre-tax gain of $41 million ($23 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2008.  

 Income Tax Expense 

The composite federal and state statutory income tax rate was approximately 40% (net of the federal benefit for state income taxes) for all periods presented. The lower effective tax rate of 33% realized in 2009, as compared to the statutory rate, was primarily due to the impacts of the Global Settlement. The lower effective tax rates of 32.6% and (2.9)% realized in 2008 and 2007 respectively, as compared to the statutory rate, were primarily due to low income housing tax credits.

At December 31, 2009, EMG and its subsidiaries had cash and equivalents and short-term investments of $808 million, excluding approximately $378 million at Edison Capital which is expected to be used to meet tax, debt and other obligations of this business segment. EMG's subsidiaries had a total of $960 million of available borrowing capacity under their credit facilities. EMG's consolidated debt at December 31, 2009 was $4.1 billion, of which $127 million was current. In addition, EME's subsidiaries had $3.2 billion of long-term lease obligations related to their sale-leaseback transactions that are due over periods ranging up to 25 years.  

The following table summarizes the status of the EME and Midwest Generation credit facilities at December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., a lender in EME's credit agreement representing a commitment of $36 million, in September 2008 declined requests for funding under that agreement and in October 2008, filed for bankruptcy protection.  

EME intends to focus on a selective growth strategy, focusing primarily on the completion of renewable energy projects under construction and the development of similar projects which deploy current turbines in storage and on order. In 2010, EME anticipates capital expenditures of $1.3 billion (as described in the proceeding table) to be funded with a  

105 

Table of Contents 

combination of project-level financing, U.S. Treasury grants, cash on hand, and cash flow from operations. EME intends to negotiate turbine payment deferrals, where possible. EME has secured financing of $206 million through vendor financing and anticipates funds from U.S. Treasury grants filed during the first quarter of 2010 totaling $92 million. EME intends to seek project level financing for wind projects in construction during 2010.  

EME may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchange offers, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, EME's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  

 Redemption of Edison Capital Medium-Term Loans 

In January 2010, Edison Capital redeemed in full its medium-term loans. As a result of the redemption, Edison Capital is no longer subject to the minimum net worth covenant set forth in the financial covenants.  

 Capital Investment Plan 

The actual capital expenditures for 2009, and the currently estimated capital expenditures for 2010 through 2012 by EME's subsidiaries for existing projects, corporate activities and turbine commitments are as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Environmental expenditures include primarily expenditures related to SNCR equipment. Additional expenditures are anticipated, however, the amounts and timing have not been determined. For additional discussion, see "Item 1. BusinessEnvironmental Matters and Regulations." 

2Includes projects beginning construction in January 2010 and $206 million in turbine purchases for 2010 where financing has been arranged. For further discussion, see "Project-Level Financing" below. 

3Turbine commitments related to the Taloga and Laredo Ridge wind projects totaling $106 million are excluded from turbine commitments and included in capital and construction expenditures in 2010. Turbine commitment figures for 2010 include amounts subject to dispute under provisions in one of the turbine supply agreements. 

4Amounts exclude balance of project costs for 302 MW available for new projects, which would be an additional $225 million to $350 million based on typical project costs. 

5One of EME's existing turbine supply agreements can be terminated for convenience. Termination of this agreement in its entirety would further reduce turbine commitments by $84 million during 2010. In the event of such termination by EME, a write-off of approximately $21 million would be recognized. Another of EME's existing turbine supply agreements can be terminated for cause or for convenience. If EME terminates the agreement, this election is likely to lead to a dispute regarding grounds for termination and/or available remedies, among other matters.

 Project-Level Financing 

In October 2009, EME, through its subsidiary, Big Sky, entered into turbine financing arrangements totaling approximately $206 million for wind turbine purchase obligations related to the 240 MW Big Sky wind project. For further details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3. Liabilities and Lines of Credit."  

 Estimated Expenditures for Existing Projects 

Plant capital expenditures relate to non-environmental projects such as upgrades to boiler and turbine controls, replacement of major boiler components, mill steam inerting projects, generator stator rewinds, 4Kv switchgear and main power transformer replacement.  

Environmental expenditures at Homer City relate to emission monitoring and control projects. Midwest Generation is subject to various commitments with respect to environmental compliance. Midwest Generation continues to review all technology and unit shutdown combinations, including interim and alternative compliance solutions. For more information on the current status of environmental improvements in Illinois, see "Edison International OverviewEnvironmental Developments" and "Item 1. BusinessEnvironmental Regulation of Edison International and Subsidiaries."  

The preceding capital expenditures table includes the following projects that commenced construction or were awarded a power sales contract subsequent to December 31, 2009:  

 Taloga Wind Project 

The Taloga wind project is a 130 MW wind project in Oklahoma scheduled for completion in late 2010. EME commenced construction activities in February 2010. EME plans to use wind turbines currently in storage to complete the Taloga wind project. The remaining costs to complete the project, including construction and turbine transportation and installation, are expected to be approximately $89 million. In January 2010, the project entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company.  

 Laredo Ridge Wind Project 

The Laredo Ridge wind project is an 80 MW wind project in Nebraska scheduled for completion in late 2010. In February 2010, EME allocated turbines under one of its existing turbine supply agreements for 53 wind turbines to complete the Laredo Ridge wind project. The remaining costs to complete the project, including turbine payments, construction, and turbine transportation and installation, are expected to be approximately $177 million. The Laredo Ridge wind project is being developed under a joint development agreement. EME intends to purchase the project in the second quarter of 2010. The project has contracted to sell power to the Nebraska Public Power District under a 20-year power sales contract.  

107 

Table of Contents 

 Estimated Expenditures for Future Projects 

EME had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately 4,000 MW at January 31, 2010. The development pipeline represents potential projects with respect to which EME either owns the project rights or has exclusive acquisition rights. EME has wind turbines in storage and on order for wind projects under construction and to be used for future wind projects (turbine commitments are reflected separately in the preceding capital expenditure table). Successful completion of development of a wind project depends upon obtaining permits and agreements necessary to support an investment and may take a number of years due to factors that include local permit requirements, willingness of local utilities to purchase renewable power at sufficient prices to earn an appropriate rate of return, and availability and prices of equipment.  

 Walnut Creek Project 

Walnut Creek Energy, a subsidiary of EME, was awarded by SCE, through a competitive bidding process, a 10-year power sales contract starting in 2013 for the output of a 479 MW gas-fired peaking facility located in the City of Industry, California, which is referred to as the Walnut Creek project. In July 2008, the Los Angeles Superior Court found that actions taken by the SCAQMD, in promulgating rules that had made available a "Priority Reserve" of emissions credits for new power generation projects, did not satisfy California environmental laws. In a November 2008 decision, the Los Angeles Superior Court enjoined SCAQMD from issuing Priority Reserve emission credits to Walnut Creek and other projects. Legal challenges related to the Priority Reserve emission credits are continuing. Legislation that passed the State Assembly and is currently pending in the Senate would provide access to the credits for Walnut Creek, subject to further regulatory steps and litigation risk. In the air basins regulated by SCAQMD, the need for particulate matter (PM10) and SO2 emission credits exceeds available supply, and it is difficult to create new qualifying credits. Construction on the Walnut Creek project will not begin until its access to the Priority Reserve emission credits is restored or another source of credits is identified. The capital costs to construct this project, excluding interest, are estimated in the range of $500 million to $600 million.

 Historical Consolidated Cash Flow 

This section discusses EMG's consolidated cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities.  

 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Consolidated Cash Flows (Used) by Operating Activities 

The 2009 decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to:   

The impacts of the Global Settlement which resulted in net tax allocation payments to Edison International of $1.1 billion by Edison Capital related to the termination of Edison Capital's interests in cross-border leases.   

Lower realized revenues due to lower market prices in 2009, compared to 2008 and a decrease in margin deposits received from counterparties at December 31, 2009.  

The 2008 increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to $225 million in margin deposits received from counterparties at December 31, 2008, partially offset by the purchase of annual NOx emission allowances in 2008 by Midwest Generation.  

 Consolidated Cash Flows (Used) by Financing Activities 

The 2009 increase in cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was attributable to repayments of $376 million and $475 million under EME's corporate credit facility and Midwest Generation's working capital facility, respectively. These repayments were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of a $189 million term loan as part of a $202 million project financing completed in June 2009.  

The 2008 increase in cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was attributable to an increase in borrowings in 2008 under EME's corporate credit facility and Midwest Generation's working capital facility. In addition, EME received $12 million from the minority shareholders of the Elkhorn Ridge wind project.  

109 

 Table of Contents  

 Consolidated Cash Flows (Used) by Investing Activities 

Cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to $1.385 billion of net proceeds from termination of the cross-border leases at Edison Capital. Excluding this impact and the impact of changes in short-term investments (described below), cash provided by investing activities is related to capital expenditures and investments in other assets (primarily turbine deposits and pre-construction costs). The amount of capital expenditures and investment in other assets were $562 million in 2009, $894 million in 2008 and $838 million in 2007. The changes in the level of expenditures are primarily due to investments for renewable energy projects. Included in investments in other assets were turbine deposits for wind projects prior to the commencement of construction of $265 million in 2009, $213 million in 2008, and $271 million in 2007.  

The change in short-term investments is reflected as investing activities in the cash flow statement. Investments with maturity dates less than 90 days are considered cash equivalents and are classified as part of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet. Maturities of short-term investments are included as a source of cash from investing activities and have decreased during the past two years primarily due to EME curtailing its purchase of short-term investments.  

Other factors that impacted investing activities included:   

payments of $22 million and $19 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively, toward the purchase price of wind projects;   

proceeds of $28 million from the sale of 33% of EME's membership interest in the Elkhorn Ridge wind project during the second quarter of 2008; and   

payments of $22 million during 2007 towards the purchase price of new wind projects, payment of $24 million during 2007 to acquire an option to purchase specific projects, and payments of $11 million towards the purchase price of the Wildorado wind project during 2007.  

 Credit Ratings 

     Overview 

Credit ratings for EME, Midwest Generation and EMMT are as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Senior unsecured rating. 

2First priority senior secured rating.   

The S&P and Fitch ratings are on negative outlook, while the Moody's rating outlook is stable. EME cannot provide assurance that its current credit ratings or the credit ratings of its  

110 

Table of Contents 

subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered. EME notes that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold its securities and may be revised at any time by a rating agency.  

EME does not have any "rating triggers" contained in subsidiary financings that would result in it being required to make equity contributions or provide additional financial support to its subsidiaries, including EMMT. However, coal contracts at Midwest Generation include provisions that provide the right to request additional collateral to support payment obligations for delivered coal and may vary based on Midwest Generation's credit ratings. Furthermore, EMMT also has hedge contracts that do not require margin, but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party. For discussions of contingent features related to energy contracts, see "Margin, Collateral Deposits and Other Credit Support for Energy Contracts."  

 Credit Rating of EMMT 

The Homer City sale-leaseback documents restrict Homer City's ability to enter into derivative activities, as defined in the documents, with EMMT to sell forward the output of the Homer City facilities if EMMT does not have an investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody's or, in the absence of those ratings, if it is not rated as investment grade pursuant to EME's internal credit scoring procedures. These documents also include a requirement that Homer City's counterparty to such transactions, whether it is EMMT or another party, and Homer City, if acting as seller to an unaffiliated third party, be investment grade. EME currently sells all the output from the Homer City facilities through EMMT, which has a below investment grade credit rating, and Homer City is not rated. In order to continue to sell forward the output of the Homer City facilities through EMMT, EME has obtained a consent from the sale-leaseback owner participants that allows Homer City to enter into such sales, under specified conditions, through March 1, 2014. Homer City continues to be in compliance with the terms of the consent; however, because EMMT's credit rating has dropped below BB-, the consent is revocable by the sale-leaseback owner participants at any time. The sale-leaseback owner participants have not indicated that they intend to revoke the consent; however, there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. An additional consequence of EMMT's lowered credit rating is that outstanding accounts receivable between EMMT and Homer City have been reduced to zero, as required under the terms of the consent. Revocation of the consent would not affect trades between EMMT and Homer City that had been entered into while the consent was still in effect. EME is permitted to sell the output of the Homer City facilities into the spot market on the terms set forth in the Homer City sale-leaseback documents. For further discussion, see "EMG: Market Risk ExposuresCommodity Price RiskEnergy Price Risk Affecting Sales from the Fossil-Fueled Facilities."  

 Margin, Collateral Deposits and Other Credit Support for Energy Contracts 

To reduce its exposure to market risk, EME hedges a portion of its electricity price exposure through EMMT. In connection with entering into contracts, EMMT may be required to support its risk of nonperformance through parent guarantees, margining or other credit  

111 

Table of Contents 

support. EME has entered into guarantees in support of EMMT's hedging and trading activities; however, EME has historically also provided collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties related to the net of accounts payable, accounts receivable, unrealized losses, and unrealized gains in connection with these hedging and trading activities. At December 31, 2009, EMMT had deposited $85 million in cash with clearing brokers in support of futures contracts and had deposited $35 million in cash with counterparties in support of forward energy and congestion contracts. Cash collateral provided to others offset against derivative liabilities totaled $49 million at December 31, 2009. In addition, EME had received cash collateral of $124 million at December 31, 2009, to support credit risk of counterparties under margin agreements; $68 million of which is classified as restricted cash. The liability for margin deposits received from counterparties has been offset against net derivative assets.  

Future cash collateral requirements may be higher than the margin and collateral requirements at December 31, 2009, if wholesale energy prices change or additional transactions are entered into. EME estimates that margin and collateral requirements for energy and congestion contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2009 could increase by approximately $90 million over the remaining life of the contracts using a 95% confidence level. This increase may not be offset by similar changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items in the same periods. Certain EMMT hedge contracts do not require margin, but contain provisions that require EME or Midwest Generation to comply with the terms and conditions of their credit facilities. The credit facilities contain financial covenants which are described further in "Dividend Restrictions in Major Financings."  

Furthermore, the hedge contracts include provisions relating to a change in control or material adverse effect resulting from amendments or modifications to the related credit facility. EMMT also has hedge contracts that do not require margin, but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features is in an asset position on December 31, 2009 and, accordingly, the contingent features described above do not currently have a liquidity exposure. Future increases in power prices could expose EME or Midwest Generation to termination payments or additional collateral postings under the contingent features described above.  

Midwest Generation has cash on hand and a credit facility to support margin requirements specifically related to contracts entered into by EMMT related to the Midwest Generation plants. In addition, EME has cash on hand and a credit facility to provide credit support to subsidiaries. For discussion on available borrowing capacity under Midwest Generation and EME credit facilities, see "EMG: Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverview."  

 Intercompany Tax-Allocation Agreement 

EME and Edison Capital are included in the consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns of Edison International and are eligible to participate in tax-allocation payments with other subsidiaries of Edison International in circumstances where domestic tax losses are incurred. The right of EME and Edison Capital to receive and the amount of and timing of  

112 

Table of Contents 

tax-allocation payments are dependent on the inclusion of EME and Edison Capital in the consolidated income tax returns of Edison International and its subsidiaries and other factors, including the consolidated taxable income of Edison International and its subsidiaries, the amount of net operating losses and other tax items of EMG's subsidiaries, and other subsidiaries of Edison International and specific procedures regarding allocation of state taxes. EME and Edison Capital receive tax-allocation payments for tax losses when and to the extent that the consolidated Edison International group generates sufficient taxable income in order to be able to utilize EME's or Edison Capital's consolidated tax losses in the consolidated income tax returns for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Based on the application of the factors cited above, EME and Edison Capital are obligated during periods it generates taxable income to make payments under the tax-allocation agreements. In connection with the Global Settlement with the IRS, EME made a payment of $18 million and assigned a tax receivable of $125 million to its parent, Mission Energy Holding Company, in satisfaction of its obligations under a tax-allocation agreement in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, EME received net tax-allocation payments of $166 million in 2009 and made net tax-allocation payments to Edison International of $95 million and $112 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In connection with the Global Settlement, Edison Capital made net tax-allocation payments of $1.1 billion in 2009. Edison Capital made net tax-allocation payments of $15 million in 2008 and received net tax-allocation payments from Edison International of $17 million in 2007.  

 Debt Covenants and Dividend Restrictions 

     Credit Facility Financial Ratios 

EME's credit facility contains financial covenants which require EME to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum corporate-debt-to-corporate-capital ratio as such terms are defined in the credit facility.  

The following table sets forth the interest coverage ratio for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008:

 Dividend Restrictions in Major Financings 

Each of EME's direct or indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from EME and its other subsidiaries. Assets of EME's subsidiaries are not available to satisfy EME's obligations or the obligations of any of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law and the terms of financing arrangements of the parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to EME or to its subsidiary holding companies.  

 Key Ratios of EME's Principal Subsidiaries Affecting Dividends 

Set forth below are key ratios of EME's principal subsidiaries required by financing arrangements at December 31, 2009 or for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Midwest Generation Financing Restrictions on Distributions 

Midwest Generation is bound by the covenants in its credit agreement and certain covenants under the Powerton-Joliet lease documents with respect to Midwest Generation making payments under the leases. These covenants include restrictions on the ability to, among other things, incur debt, create liens on its property, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, make distributions, make capital expenditures, enter into agreements restricting its ability to make distributions, engage in other lines of business, enter into swap agreements, or engage in transactions for any speculative purpose. In order for Midwest Generation to make a distribution, it must be in compliance with the covenants specified under its credit agreement, including maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.60 to 1.  

 Homer City 

Homer City completed a sale-leaseback of the Homer City facilities in December 2001. In order to make a distribution, Homer City must be in compliance with the covenants specified in the lease agreements, including the following financial performance requirements measured on the date of distribution:  

At the end of each quarter, the senior rent service coverage ratio for the prior 12-month period (taken as a whole) must be greater than 1.7 to 1. The senior rent service coverage ratio is defined as all income and receipts of Homer City less amounts paid for operating expenses, capital expenditures funded by Homer City, taxes and financing fees divided by the aggregate amount of the debt portion of the rent, plus fees, expenses and indemnities due and payable with respect to the lessor's debt service reserve letter of credit.  

114 

Table of Contents 

At the end of each quarter, the equity and debt portions of rent then due and payable must have been paid. The senior rent service coverage ratio (discussed above) projected for each of the prospective two 12-month periods must be greater than 1.7 to 1. No more than two rent default events may have occurred, whether or not cured. A rent default event is defined as the failure to pay the equity portion of the rent within five business days of when it is due. EME has not guaranteed Homer City's obligations under the leases.  

 Corporate Credit Facility Restrictions on Distributions from Subsidiaries 

EME's corporate credit agreement contains covenants that restrict its ability and the ability of several of its subsidiaries to make distributions. This restriction impacts the subsidiaries that own interests in the Westside projects, the Sunrise project, the fossil-fueled facilities, and the Big 4 projects. These subsidiaries would not be able to make a distribution to EME's shareholder if an event of default were to occur and be continuing under EME's secured credit agreement after giving effect to the distribution.  

 Senior Notes and Guaranty of Powerton-Joliet Leases 

EME is restricted from the sale or disposition of assets, which includes the making of a distribution, if the aggregate net book value of all such sales and dispositions during the most recent 12-month period would exceed 10% of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in such agreements computed as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter preceding such sale or disposition. At December 31, 2009, the maximum sale or disposition of EME assets was $799 million.

 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies 

     Contractual Obligations 

EME has contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements. The following table summarizes EME's significant consolidated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For more information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 5. Compensation and Benefit PlansPension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." 

5At December 31, 2009, EME had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $97 million, which is excluded from the table. EME cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. For more information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes."

 Commercial Commitments 

     Standby Letters of Credit 

As of December 31, 2009, standby letters of credit under EME and its subsidiaries' credit facilities aggregated $119 million and were scheduled to expire as follows: $111 million in 2010 and $8 million in 2011.  

 Contingencies 

EME's significant contingencies related to the Midwest Generation NSR lawsuit and the Homer City NSR NOV, environmental remediation, and environmental developments are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies."  

 Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 

EMG has off-balance sheet transactions in three principal areas: investments in projects accounted for under the equity method, operating leases resulting from sale-leaseback transactions and leveraged leases.  

 Investments Accounted for under the Equity Method 

EME has a number of investments in power projects that are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, the project assets and related liabilities are not consolidated on EME's consolidated balance sheet. Rather, EME's financial statements reflect its investment in each entity and it records only its proportionate ownership share of net income or loss.  

EME owns a number of domestic energy projects through partnerships in which it has a 50% or less ownership interest. Entities formed to own these projects are generally structured with a management committee in which EME exercises significant influence but cannot exercise unilateral control over the operating, funding or construction activities of the project entity. Two of these projects have long-term debt that is secured by a pledge of the assets of the project entity, but do not provide for any recourse to EME. Accordingly, a default on a long-term financing of a project could result in foreclosure on the assets of the project entity resulting in a loss of some or all of EME's project investment, but would not require EME to contribute additional capital. At December 31, 2009, entities which EME has accounted for under the equity method had indebtedness of $245 million, of which $104 million is proportionate to EME's ownership interest in these projects.  

Edison Capital has invested in affordable housing projects utilizing partnership or limited liability companies in which Edison Capital is a limited partner or limited liability member. In these entities, Edison Capital usually owns a 99% interest. With a few exceptions, an unrelated general partner or managing member exercises operating control; voting rights of Edison Capital are limited by agreement to certain significant organizational matters. Edison Capital has subsequently sold a majority of these interests to unrelated third party investors through syndication partnerships in which Edison Capital has retained an interest, with one  

117 

Table of Contents 

exception, of less than 20%. The debt of those partnerships and limited liability companies is secured by real property. At December 31, 2009, entities that Edison Capital has accounted for under the equity method had indebtedness of approximately $1.5 billion, of which approximately $631 million is proportionate to Edison Capital's ownership interest in these projects. Substantially all of this debt is nonrecourse to Edison Capital.  

 Sale-Leaseback Transactions 

EME has entered into sale-leaseback transactions related to the Powerton Station and Units 7 and 8 of the Joliet Station in Illinois and the Homer City facilities in Pennsylvania. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and ContingenciesLease Commitments."  

The lessor equity and lessor debt associated with the sale-leaseback transactions for the Powerton, Joliet and Homer City assets are summarized in the following table:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

PSEG  PSEG Resources, Inc.

 GECC  General Electric Capital Corporation   

In the event of a default under the leases, each lessor can exercise all its rights under the applicable lease, including repossessing the power plant and seeking monetary damages. Each lease sets forth a termination value payable upon termination for default and in certain other circumstances, which generally declines over time and in the case of default may be reduced by the proceeds arising from the sale of the repossessed power plant. A default under the terms of the Powerton and Joliet or Homer City leases could result in a loss of EME's ability to use such power plant. In addition, a default under the terms of the Powerton and Joliet leases would trigger obligations under EME's guarantee of such leases. These events could have a material adverse effect on EME's results of operations and financial position.  

 Leveraged Leases 

Edison Capital is a lessor in power and infrastructure projects with terms of 25 to 30 years. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 18. Investments in Leveraged Leases, Partnerships and Unconsolidated Subsidiaries" for details of the lease investments.

Table of Contents 

 MARKET RISK EXPOSURES 

EMG's primary market risk exposures are associated with the sale of electricity and capacity from, and the procurement of fuel for, its merchant power plants. These market risks arise from fluctuations in the prices of electricity, capacity, fuel, emission allowances, and transmission rights. Additionally, EME's financial results can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates. EME manages these risks in part by using derivative instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures.  

 Commodity Price Risk 

EME's merchant operations create exposure to commodity price risk, which reflects the potential impact of a change in the market value of a particular commodity. Commodity price risks are actively monitored, with oversight provided by a risk management committee, to ensure compliance with EME's risk management policies. Policies are in place which define risk management processes, and procedures exist which allow for monitoring of all commitments and positions with regular reviews by EME's risk management committee. Despite this, there can be no assurance that all risks have been accurately identified, measured and/or mitigated.  

In addition to prevailing market prices, EME's ability to derive profits from the sale of electricity will be affected by the cost of production, including costs incurred to comply with environmental regulations. The costs of production of the units vary and, accordingly, depending on market conditions, the amount of generation that will be sold from the units may vary.  

EME uses estimates of the variability in gross margin to help identify, measure, monitor and control its overall market risk exposure and earnings volatility with respect to hedge positions at the fossil-fueled facilities, and the merchant wind projects, and uses "value at risk" metrics to help identify, measure, monitor and control its overall risk exposure with respect to its trading positions. These measures allow management to aggregate overall commodity risk, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify changes in risk factors. Value at risk measures the possible loss, and variability in gross margin measures the potential change in value, of an asset or position, in each case over a given time interval, under normal market conditions, at a given confidence level. Given the inherent limitations of these measures and reliance on a single type of risk measurement tool, EME supplements these approaches with the use of stress testing and worst-case scenario analysis for key risk factors, as well as stop-loss triggers volumetric exposure limits.  

 Energy Price Risk Affecting Sales from the Fossil-Fueled Facilities 

Energy and capacity from the fossil-fueled facilities are sold under terms, including price, duration and quantity, arranged by EMMT with customers through a combination of bilateral agreements (resulting from negotiations or from auctions), forward energy sales and spot market sales. Power is sold into PJM at spot prices based upon locational marginal pricing. Hedging transactions related to generation are generally entered into at the Northern Illinois Hub or the AEP/Dayton Hub, both in PJM, for the Midwest Generation plants and generally  

119 

Table of Contents 

at the PJM West Hub for the Homer City facilities. These trading hubs have been the most liquid locations for hedging purposes. See "Basis Risk" below for further discussion.  

The following table depicts the average historical market prices for energy per megawatt-hour at the locations indicated:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Energy prices were calculated at the respective delivery points using historical hourly real-time prices as published by PJM or provided on the PJM web-site.   

The following table sets forth the forward market prices for energy per megawatt-hour as quoted for sales into the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub at December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Energy prices were determined by obtaining broker quotes and information from other public sources relating to the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub delivery point. 

2Market price for energy purchases for the entire calendar year.   

Forward market prices at the Northern Illinois Hub and PJM West Hub fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including natural gas prices, transmission congestion, changes in market rules, electricity demand (which in turn is affected by weather, economic growth, and other factors), plant outages in the region, and the amount of existing and planned power plant capacity. The actual spot prices for electricity delivered by the fossil-fueled facilities into these markets may vary materially from the forward market prices set forth in the preceding table.

Table of Contents 

EMMT engages in hedging activities for the fossil-fueled facilities to hedge the risk of future change in the price of electricity. The following table summarizes the hedge positions as of December 31, 2009 for electricity expected to be generated in 2010 and 2011:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day. Market prices tend to be higher during on-peak periods and during summer months, although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time. Accordingly, the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the 24-hour Northern Illinois Hub or PJM West Hub prices set forth above. Furthermore, the average price/MWh for Homer City's hedge position is based on the PJM West Hub. Energy prices at the Homer City busbar have been lower than energy prices at the PJM West Hub.   

In addition, as of December 31, 2009, EMMT has entered into 3.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas futures contracts (equivalent to approximately 557 GWh of energy only contracts using a ratio of 6 MMBtu to 1 MWh) for the Midwest Generation plants to economically hedge energy price risks during 2010 at an average price of $38.40/MWh.  

 Capacity Price Risk 

On June 1, 2007, PJM implemented the RPM for capacity. Under the RPM, capacity commitments are made in advance to provide a long-term pricing signal for capacity resources. The RPM is intended to provide a mechanism for PJM to meet the region's need for generation capacity, while allocating the cost to load-serving entities through a locational reliability charge.  

121 

 Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the status of capacity sales for Midwest Generation and Homer City at December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Capacity not sold arises from: (i) capacity retained to meet forced outages under the RPM auction guidelines, and (ii) capacity that PJM does not purchase at the clearing price resulting from the RPM auction. 

2Other capacity sales and purchases, net includes contracts executed in advance of the RPM base residual auction to hedge the price risk related to such auction, participation in RPM incremental auctions and other capacity transactions entered into to manage capacity risks.   

The RPM auction capacity prices for the delivery period of June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 varied between different areas of PJM. In the western portion of PJM, affecting Midwest Generation, the price of $16.46 per MW-day was substantially lower than previous capacity prices. The decrease in forward capacity prices was attributable to a substantial increase in demand side management resources. The impact of lower capacity prices for this period will have an adverse effect on Midwest Generation's revenues unless such lower capacity prices are offset by an unavailability of competing resources and increased energy prices, which is uncertain.  

Revenues from the sale of capacity from Midwest Generation and Homer City beyond the periods set forth above will depend upon the amount of capacity available and future market prices either in PJM or nearby markets if EME has an opportunity to capture a higher value associated with those markets. Under PJM's RPM system, the market price for capacity is generally determined by aggregate market-based supply conditions and an administratively set aggregate demand curve. Among the factors influencing the supply of capacity in any particular market are plant forced outage rates, plant closings, plant delistings (due to plants being removed as capacity resources and/or to export capacity to other markets), capacity imports from other markets, demand side management activities and the cost of new entry.

 Basis Risk 

Sales made from the fossil-fueled facilities in the real-time or day-ahead market receive the actual spot prices or day-ahead prices, as the case may be, at the busbars (delivery points) of the individual plants. In order to mitigate price risk from changes in spot prices at the individual plant busbars, EME may enter into cash settled futures contracts as well as forward contracts with counterparties for energy to be delivered in future periods. Currently, a liquid market for entering into these contracts at the individual plant busbars does not exist. A liquid market does exist for a settlement point at the PJM West Hub in the case of the Homer City facilities and for settlement points at the Northern Illinois Hub and the AEP/Dayton Hub in the case of the Midwest Generation plants. EME's hedging activities use these settlement points (and, to a lesser extent, other similar trading hubs) to enter into hedging contracts. To the extent that, on the settlement date of a hedge contract, spot prices at the relevant busbar are lower than spot prices at the settlement point, the proceeds actually realized from the related hedge contract are effectively reduced by the difference. This is referred to as "basis risk." During 2009, transmission congestion in PJM has resulted in prices at the Homer City busbar being lower than those at the PJM West Hub by an average of 9%, compared to 16% during 2008 and 15% during 2007. During 2009, transmission congestion in PJM has resulted in prices at the individual busbars of the Midwest Generation plants being lower than those at the AEP/Dayton Hub and Northern Illinois Hub by an average of 14% and less than 1%, respectively, compared to 10% and 2%, respectively, during 2008.  

By entering into cash settled futures contracts and forward contracts using the PJM West Hub, the Northern Illinois Hub, and the AEP/Dayton Hub (or other similar trading hubs) as settlement points, EME is exposed to basis risk as described above. In order to mitigate basis risk, EME may purchase financial transmission rights and basis swaps in PJM for Homer City and Midwest Generation. A financial transmission right is a financial instrument that entitles the holder to receive the difference between actual spot prices for two delivery points in exchange for a fixed amount. Accordingly, EME's hedging activities include using financial transmission rights alone or in combination with forward contracts and basis swap contracts to manage basis risk.  

 Coal and Transportation Price Risk 

The Midwest Generation plants and Homer City facilities purchase coal primarily obtained from the Southern PRB of Wyoming and from mines located near the facilities in Pennsylvania, respectively.  

123 

Table of Contents 

Coal purchases are made under a variety of supply agreements. The following table summarizes the amount of coal under contract at December 31, 2009 for the following three years:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The amount of coal under contract in tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an 8,800 Btu equivalent for the Midwest Generation plants and 13,000 Btu equivalent for the Homer City facilities. 

2In January and February 2010, Midwest Generation entered into additional contractual agreements for the purchase of 1 million tons for 2010 and 2 million tons for 2011. 

3In January 2010, Homer City exercised options under existing contractual agreements for the purchase of 0.3 million tons for 2011, 0.5 million tons for 2012 and 0.5 million tons for 2013. In February 2010, Homer City entered into additional contractual agreements for the purchase of 0.4 million tons for 2011.   

EME is subject to price risk for purchases of coal that are not under contract. Prices of NAPP coal, which are related to the price of coal purchased for the Homer City facilities, decreased during 2009 from 2008 and increased substantially during 2008 from 2007. The price of NAPP coal (with 13,000 Btu per pound heat content and <3.0 pounds of SO2 per MMBtu sulfur content) decreased to a price of $52.50 per ton at December 31, 2009, compared to a price of $76 per ton at January 9, 2009, as reported by the EIA. In 2009, the price of NAPP coal ranged from $43.50 per ton to $76 per ton, as reported by the EIA. The 2009 decrease in NAPP coal prices was due in part to current global economic conditions that have lessened demand for coal, high levels of inventories and fuel switching. In 2008, the price of NAPP coal ranged from $61.75 per ton to $150 per ton, as reported by the EIA. In 2007, the price of NAPP coal fluctuated between $44.00 per ton to $55.25 per ton, which was the price per ton at December 21, 2007, as reported by the EIA.  

Prices of PRB coal (with 8,800 Btu per pound heat content and 0.8 pounds of SO2 per MMBtu sulfur content) purchased for the Midwest Generation plants declined during 2009 from 2008 year-end prices and increased during 2008 from 2007 year-end prices. The price of PRB coal fluctuated between $8.25 per ton and $13 per ton during 2009, with a price of $9.25 per ton at December 31, 2009, as reported by the EIA. The 2009 decrease in PRB coal prices was due to lower demand and higher levels of inventory. In 2008, the price of PRB coal fluctuated between $11 per ton to $14.50 per ton, with a price of $13 per ton at January 9, 2009, as reported by the EIA. In 2007, the price of PRB coal ranged from $8.35 per ton to $11.50 per ton, which was the price per ton at December 21, 2007, as reported by the EIA.  

EME has contractual agreements for the transport of coal to its facilities. The primary contract is with Union Pacific Railroad (and various short-haul carriers), which extends through 2011. EME is exposed to price risk related to higher transportation rates after the expiration of its existing transportation contracts. Current transportation rates for PRB coal  

124 

Table of Contents 

are higher than the existing rates under contract (transportation costs are approximately half of the delivered cost of PRB coal to the Midwest Generation plants).  

Based on EME's anticipated coal requirements in 2010 in excess of the amount under contract, EME expects that a 10% change in the price of coal at December 31, 2009 would increase or decrease pre-tax income in 2010 by approximately $6 million.  

 Emission Allowances Price Risk 

The federal Acid Rain Program requires electric generating stations to hold SO2 allowances sufficient to cover their annual emissions. Pursuant to Pennsylvania's and Illinois' implementation of the CAIR, electric generating stations also are required to hold seasonal and annual NOx allowances beginning January 1, 2009. As part of the acquisition of the fossil-fueled facilities, EME obtained emission allowance rights that have been or are allocated to these plants. EME purchases (or sells) emission allowances based on the amounts required for actual generation in excess of (or less than) the amounts allocated under these programs. For further discussion of the CAIR, see "Item 1. BusinessEnvironmental Matters and RegulationsAir QualityNitrogen Oxide and Sulfur Dioxide."  

In the event that actual emissions required are greater than allowances held, EME is subject to price risk for purchases of emission allowances. The market price for emission allowances may vary significantly. The average purchase price of SO2 allowances was $65 per ton in 2009, $315 per ton in 2008 and $512 per ton in 2007. The average purchase price of annual NOx allowances was $1,431 per ton in 2009. Based on broker's quotes and information from public sources, the spot price for SO2 allowances and annual NOx allowances was $60 per ton and $665 per ton, respectively, at December 31, 2009.  

Based on EME's anticipated annual and seasonal NOx requirements for 2010 beyond those allowances already purchased, EME expects that a 10% change in the price of annual and seasonal NOx emission allowances at December 31, 2009 would increase or decrease pre-tax income in 2010 by approximately $0.7 million.  

 Credit Risk 

In conducting EME's hedging and trading activities, EME enters into transactions with utilities, energy companies, financial institutions, and other companies, collectively referred to as counterparties. In the event a counterparty were to default on its trade obligation, EME would be exposed to the risk of possible loss associated with market price changes occurring since the original contract was executed if the nonperforming counterparty were unable to pay the resulting damages owed to EME. Further, EME would be exposed to the risk of non-payment of accounts receivable accrued for products delivered prior to the time a counterparty defaulted.  

To manage credit risk, EME evaluates the risk of potential defaults by counterparties. Credit risk is measured as the loss that EME would expect to incur if a counterparty failed to perform pursuant to the terms of its contractual obligations. EME measures, monitors and mitigates credit risk to the extent possible. To mitigate credit risk from counterparties, master netting agreements are used whenever possible and counterparties may be required to pledge  

125 

Table of Contents 

collateral when deemed necessary. EME also takes other appropriate steps to limit or lower credit exposure.  

EME has established processes to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. EME manages the credit risk of its counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings, and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements. A risk management committee regularly reviews the credit quality of EME's counterparties. Despite this, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be wholly successful in mitigating credit risk or that collateral pledged will be adequate.  

The credit risk exposure from counterparties of merchant energy hedging and trading activities is measured as the sum of net receivables (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets. EME's subsidiaries enter into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting such activities which typically provide for a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty. At December 31, 2009, the balance sheet exposure as described above, broken down by the credit ratings of EME's counterparties, was as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1EME assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty's S&P or Moody's rating. For ease of reference, the above table uses the S&P classifications to summarize risk, but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings. 

2Exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non-derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, except for any related accounts receivable.   

The credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is comprised of $160 million of net accounts receivable and payables and $318 million representing the fair value of derivative contracts. The exposure is based on master netting agreements with the related counterparties. Due to developments in the financial markets, credit ratings may not be reflective of the actual related credit risks. In addition to the amounts set forth in the above table, EME's subsidiaries have posted a $120 million cash margin in the aggregate with PJM, NYISO, MISO, clearing brokers and other counterparties to support hedging and trading activities. The margin posted to support these activities also exposes EME to credit risk of the related entities.  

126 

Table of Contents 

The majority of EME's consolidated wind projects and unconsolidated affiliates that own power plants sell power under power purchase agreements. Generally, each project or plant sells its output to one counterparty. A default by the counterparty, including a default as a result of a bankruptcy, would likely have a material adverse effect on the operations of the project or plant.  

Coal for the fossil-fueled facilities is purchased from suppliers under contracts which may be for multiple years. A number of the coal suppliers to the fossil-fueled facilities do not currently have an investment grade credit rating and, accordingly, EME may have limited recourse to collect damages in the event of default by a supplier. EME seeks to mitigate this risk through diversification of its coal suppliers and through guarantees and other collateral arrangements when available. Despite this, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in mitigating credit risk from coal suppliers.  

The fossil-fueled facilities sell electric power generally into the PJM market by participating in PJM's capacity and energy markets or transact in capacity and energy on a bilateral basis. Sales into PJM accounted for approximately 48% of EME's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Moody's rates PJM's debt Aa3. PJM, an ISO with over 300 member companies, maintains its own credit risk policies and does not extend unsecured credit to non-investment grade companies. Losses resulting from a PJM member default are shared by all other members using a predetermined formula. At December 31, 2009, EME's account receivable due from PJM was $50 million.  

For the year ended December 31, 2009, a second customer, Constellation Energy Commodities Group, Inc., accounted for 16% of EME's consolidated operating revenues. Sales to Constellation are primarily generated from the fossil-fueled facilities and consist of energy sales under forward contracts. The contract with Constellation is guaranteed by Constellation Energy Group, Inc., which at December 31, 2009 had a senior unsecured debt rating of BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's. At December 31, 2009, EME's account receivable due from Constellation was $36 million.  

The terms of EME's wind turbine supply agreements contain significant obligations of the suppliers in the form of manufacturing and delivery of turbines, and payments for delays in delivery and for failure to meet performance obligations and warranty agreements. EME's reliance on these contractual provisions is subject to credit risks. Generally, these are unsecured obligations of the turbine manufacturer. A material adverse development with respect to EME's turbine suppliers may have a material impact on EME's wind projects and development efforts.  

 Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate changes can affect earnings and the cost of capital for capital improvements or new investments in power projects. EMG mitigates the risk of interest rate fluctuations by arranging for fixed rate financing or variable rate financing with interest rate swaps, interest rate options or other hedging mechanisms for a number of its project financings. The fair market values of long-term fixed interest rate obligations are subject to interest rate risk. The fair market value of EMG's consolidated long-term obligations (including current portion) was $3.25 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to the carrying value of $4.1 billion. A 10% increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2009 would result in a decrease in the fair value of total long-term obligations by approximately $176 million. A 10% decrease in market interest rates at December 31, 2009 would result in an increase in the fair value of total long-term obligations by approximately $194 million.

 EDISON INTERNATIONAL PARENT AND OTHER 

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Results of operations for Edison International parent and other includes amounts from other Edison International subsidiaries that are not significant as a reportable segment, as well as intercompany eliminations.  

Edison International parent and other earnings (loss) from continuing operations were $18 million, $(29) million and $(19) million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 was due to the impact of the Global Settlement resulting from lower combined state deferred income taxes recorded by Edison International and its subsidiaries under their respective tax allocation agreements.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

     Historical Cash Flow 

This section discusses Edison International (parent) and other cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities.  

 Condensed Statement of Cash Flows 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Cash Flows Used by Operating Activities 

Cash flows from operating activities were primarily related to interest, operating costs and income taxes of Edison International (parent). Included in operating activities during 2009 was the impacts of the Global Settlement which resulted in remittances of approximately $343 million to the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board.  

Under the tax allocation agreement with EMG, Edison International received net payments of approximately $1.2 billion, principally from Edison Capital funded by the proceeds of termination of the cross border leases. Edison International made net tax allocation payments of approximately $875 million to SCE.

Table of Contents 

Edison International expects that the Global Settlement, together with the termination of the Edison Capital cross border leases, will result in a positive cash impact over time. The following table provides the approximate cash flow expected over time by major subsidiary:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1Includes all other Edison International consolidated subsidiaries including EME and other EMG subsidiaries.   

See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes" for further discussion of the Global Settlement.  

The $162 million increase in 2008 cash flows from operating activities compared to 2007 was primarily due to the following:   

SCE held $78 million and $75 million of intercompany notes receivables from EME and Edison International, respectively, which were repaid in 2007. The elimination of the cash received to settle the intercompany receivable is reflected in cash flows from operating activities, and the elimination of EME's repayment of its intercompany note payable is reflected in financing activities.  

 Cash Flows Provided (Used) by Financing Activities 

Financing activities for 2009 were as follows:   

Paid $404 million of (or $0.31 per share) dividends to Edison International common shareholders. These quarterly dividends represent an increase of $0.005 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2008.   

In December 2009, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared a $0.315 per share quarterly dividend which was paid in January 2010. This quarterly dividend represents an increase of $0.005 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2009. The 2009 dividend increase is consistent with Edison International's dividend policy of paying out approximately 45% to 55% of the earnings of SCE and balancing dividend increases with the significantly growing capital needs of Edison International's business.    

Repaid a net $165 million of short-term debt, primarily due to the improvement in economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008.   

Received $300 million of dividend payments from SCE.  

129 

Table of Contents 

Financing activities for 2008 were as follows:   

Paid $397 million of dividends to Edison International common shareholders.   

Received $325 million of dividend payments from SCE.   

Issued $250 million of short-term debt, primarily due to the economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008.   

Received $120 million from an intercompany loan between Edison Capital and Edison International in 2008.  

Financing activities for 2007 were as follows:   

Paid $378 million of dividends to Edison International common shareholders.   

Repaid $75 million of intercompany notes payable to SCE (discussed above in operating activities).   

Received $135 million and $237 million of dividend payments from SCE and EME, respectively.   

Received $50 million from an intercompany loan between Edison Capital and Edison International in 2007.  

 EDISON INTERNATIONAL (CONSOLIDATED) 

     Contractual Obligations 

Edison International's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, for the years 2010 through 2014 and thereafter are estimated below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3. Liabilities and Lines of Credit." Amount includes interest payments totaling $9.5 billion over applicable period of the debt. 

2At December 31, 2009, minimum operating lease payments were primarily related to power contracts, vehicles, office space and other equipment. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies."   

130 

Table of Contents 

3At December 31, 2009, minimum capital lease payments were primarily related to power purchased contracts that meet the requirements for capital leases. For further discussion, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies." 

4For additional details, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies." 

5Amount includes estimated contributions to the pension and PBOP plans. The estimated contributions for Edison International are not available beyond 2010. Due to the volatile market conditions experienced in 2008 and the decline in value of Edison International's trusts, Edison International's contributions increased in 2009. Based on pension and PBOP plan assets at December 31, 2009, SCE expects a decrease in contributions in 2010 but cannot predict or estimate contributions beyond 2010. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 5. Compensation and Benefit Plans" for further information. 

6At December 31, 2009, Edison International had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of $621 million, which is excluded from the table. Edison International cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the IRS. 

7The contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 8. Property and Plant," respectively.   

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of Edison International's consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or, the use of alternative estimates, that could have a material impact on Edison International's results of operations or financial position. For more information on Edison International's accounting policies, see "Item 8. Edison International's Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."  

 Rate Regulated Enterprises 

 Nature of Estimate Required. SCE follows the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue, these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates; conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. SCE's management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to SCE or other rate-regulated entities in California,  

131 

Table of Contents 

and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for rate-making purposes. Using these factors, management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement. This determination reflects the current regulatory climate in California and is subject to change in the future.  

 Effect if Different Assumption Used. Significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund, as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings. At December 31, 2009, the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of $4.3 billion and regulatory liabilities of $3.7 billion. If different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition, SCE's earnings and cash flows may vary from the amounts reported.  

 Derivatives 

 Nature of Estimates Required. Management's judgment is required to determine if a transaction meets the definition of a derivative and, if it does, whether the normal sales and purchases exception applies or whether individual transactions qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of Edison International's long-term power sales and fuel supply agreements related to its generation activities either: (1) do not meet the definition of a derivative, or (2) qualify as normal purchases and sales and are, therefore, recorded on an accrual basis. SCE's fair value changes are expected to be recovered from or refunded to ratepayers, and therefore SCE's fair value changes have no impact on earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows. SCE has elected not to use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment.  

EME uses derivative instruments for hedging activities and trading purposes. Derivative instruments are mainly utilized by EME to manage exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rates. Derivative commodity instruments include forward sales transactions entered into on a bilateral basis with third parties, futures contracts, full requirements services contracts or load requirements services contracts, and capacity transactions. Financial derivative instruments include interest rate swaps entered into on a bilateral basis with counterparties. EME follows authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging, which requires derivative instruments to be recorded at fair value unless an exception applies. Authoritative guidance also requires that changes in a derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized currently in earnings.  

EME records derivative instruments used for trading utilizing the fair value model. EME's derivative instruments with a short-term duration (less than one year) are normally valued

using quoted market prices. In the absence of quoted market prices, derivative instruments with a short-term duration are valued considering the time value of money, volatility of the underlying commodity, and other factors as determined by EME. Resulting gains and losses are recognized in operating revenues on the accompanying consolidated income statements.  

Derivative assets include open derivative positions recorded at fair value, including cash flow hedges, that are "in-the-money" and the present value of net amounts receivable from structured transactions. Derivative liabilities include open derivative positions, including cash flow hedges, that are "out-of-the-money." Where EME enters into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting hedging and trading activities with a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty, these types of transactions are reported net on the balance sheet.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. EME determines the fair value of its derivatives based on forward market prices in active markets adjusted for nonperformance risk. If quoted market prices are not available, internally developed models are used to determine the fair value. When actual market prices, or relevant observable inputs are not available, it is appropriate to use unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions, including extrapolating limited short-term observable data and developing correlations between liquid and non-liquid trading hubs. In assessing nonperformance risks, EME reviews credit ratings of counterparties (and related default rates based on such credit ratings) and prices of credit default swaps. The market price (or premium) for credit default swaps represents the price that a counterparty would pay to transfer the risk of default, typically bankruptcy, to another party. A credit default swap is not directly comparable to the credit risks of derivative contracts, but provides market information of the related risk of nonperformance.  

In addition, a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. For further information, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 10. Fair Value Measurements."  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. As described above, fair value is determined using a combination of market information or observable data and unobservable inputs which reflect management's assumptions. Changes in observable data would impact results. In addition, unobservable inputs could have an impact on results. Fair value for Level 3 derivatives is derived using observable and unobservable inputs. As of December 31, 2009, EME and SCE Level 3 derivatives had a net fair value of $173 million and $(111) million, respectively. While it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one input, if the fair value of EME and SCE Level 3 derivatives were increased or decreased by 10%, the impact would be a $17 million and $11 million increase or decrease to operating revenues, respectively.  

For Edison International's derivative instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models, a significant change in estimate could affect Edison International's results of operations. For further sensitivities in Edison International's assumptions used to calculate fair value, see "EMG: Results of OperationsFair Value Measurements" and "SCE: Market Risk ExposuresNatural Gas and Electricity Price Risk."

 Nuclear Decommissioning  ARO 

 Nature of Estimate Required. Regulations by the NRC require SCE to decommission its nuclear power plants which is expected to begin after the plants' operating licenses expire. In accordance with authoritative guidance, SCE is required to record an obligation to decommission its nuclear facilities. Nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in utility rates through contributions that are reviewed every three years by the CPUC. Due to regulatory accounting treatment, nuclear decommissioning activities are not expected to affect SCE earnings.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The liability to decommission SCE's nuclear power facilities is based on site-specific studies performed in 2005 which estimate that SCE will spend approximately $11.5 billion through 2049 to decommission its active nuclear facilities. Decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each Nuclear Decommissioning Triennial Proceeding. A site-specific study was performed in 2008 which is currently awaiting CPUC approval. Once a CPUC decision is rendered the updated cost estimate is established and accreted over the lives of San Onofre and Palo Verde. The current estimate is based on the following assumptions from the 2005 site-specific study:   

Decommissioning Costs. The estimated costs for labor, dismantling and disposal costs, energy and miscellaneous costs.   

Escalation Rates. Annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future-year dollars. Escalation rates are primarily used for labor, material, equipment, and low level radioactive waste burial costs. SCE's current estimate is based on SCE's decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes, escalated at rates ranging from 1.7% to 7.5% (depending on the cost element) annually.   

Timing. Cost estimates are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current NRC operating licensees expire. The operating licenses currently expire in 2022 for San Onofre Units 2 and 3, and in 2024, 2025 and 2027 for the Palo Verde units.   

Spent Fuel Dry Storage Costs. Cost estimates are based on an assumption that the DOE will begin to take spent fuel in 2015, and will remove the last spent fuel from the San Onofre and Palo Verde sites by 2045 and 2047, respectively. Costs for spent fuel monitoring are included until 2045 and 2047, respectively.   

Changes in decommissioning technology, regulation, and economics. The current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The ARO for decommissioning SCE's active nuclear facilities was $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material affect on the recorded liability and related regulatory asset. The following table illustrates the increase to

the ARO and regulatory asset if the escalation rate or discount rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:

 Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions 

 Nature of Estimate Required. Authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet; the assets and/or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income (loss) for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates. Edison International has a fiscal year-end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans.  

 Key Assumptions of Approach Used. Pension and other postretirement obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models. Two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement. Additionally, health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually. Other assumptions, which require management judgment, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.  

As of December 31, 2009, Edison International's pension plans had a $3.7 billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was $140 million for 2009. As of December 31, 2009, Edison International's PBOP plans had a $2.1 billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was $82 million for 2009. The following are critical assumptions used

to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2009:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

1The discount rate enables Edison International to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. Edison International selects its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis. This analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows, matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. Two corporate yield curves were considered, Citigroup and AON. 

2To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, current and expected asset allocations are considered, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. A portion of PBOP trusts asset returns are subject to taxation, so the 7.0% rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after-tax basis. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the pension plan assets were 24.4%, 3.7% and 4.1% for the one-year, five-year and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2009, respectively. Actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the PBOP plan assets were 23.6%, 1.9%, and 1.5% over these same periods. Accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. 

3The health care cost trend rate is 8.75% for 2009, gradually declining to 5.5% for 2016 and beyond.   

Pension expense is recorded for SCE based on the amount funded to the trusts, as calculated using an actuarial method required for rate-making purposes, in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis. Any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with rate-making methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and will, over time, be recovered from or returned to customers. As of December 31, 2009, this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of $24 million, meaning that the accounting method has recognized $24 million more in expense than the rate-making method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers' accounting for pensions in 1987.  

Edison International's pension and PBOP plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility. SCE funds its pension and PBOP plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the CPUC. Executive pension plans and competitive power generation PBOP plans have no plan assets.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates, could have a material affect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. Edison International's total annual contributions for SCE are recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to SCE's total annual expense.

A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected benefit obligation for pension by $288 million. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation for pension by $294 million. A one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease the expense by $23 million.  

A one percentage point increase in the discount rate for PBOP would decrease the projected benefit obligation by $238 million. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate for the PBOP would increase the projected benefit obligation by $269 million. A one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on PBOP plan assets would decrease the expense by $12 million. Increasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would increase the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 by $226 million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by $15 million. Decreasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 by $206 million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by $14 million.  

 Income Taxes 

 Nature of Estimates Required. As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, Edison International is required to estimate its income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it operates. This process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within Edison International's consolidated balance sheet.  

Edison International takes certain tax positions it believes are applied in accordance with the applicable tax laws. However, these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the IRS, state tax authorities and the courts. Edison International determines its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. Accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment. Management uses judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that a tax position will be sustained, and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized. Judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes. In assessing its uncertain tax positions Edison International considers, among others, the following factors: the facts and circumstances of the position, regulations, rulings, and case law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the experience gained from similar tax positions. Management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements. Edison International continues to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex  

137 

Table of Contents 

tax laws. A tax liability has been recorded with respect to tax positions in which the outcome is uncertain and the effect is estimable. Such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded. Furthermore, settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated. See "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4. Income Taxes" for a further discussion on income taxes.  

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

 Nature of Estimates Required. EME evaluates its long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance. The amount of the impairment charges, if applicable, are calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or, in the case of assets expected to be sold, at fair value less costs to sell. Authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company's assets or group of assets (without interest charges) is less than its carrying value, asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements. EME evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist or when EME commits to sell the asset. These evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as economic or operational analyses. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded.  

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine: (1) if an indicator of impairment has occurred, (2) how assets should be grouped, (3) the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset's estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists, and (4) if an impairment exists, the fair value of the asset or asset group. Factors that EME considers important, which could trigger an impairment, include operating losses from a project, projected future operating losses, the financial condition of counterparties, or significant negative industry or economic trends. The determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in: (1) estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices that are susceptible to significant change, (2) environmental and maintenance expenditures, and (3) the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. The estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues, environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, EME may be exposed to additional losses that could be material to EME's results of operations.

 Merchant Coal-Fired Power Plants 

Weak commodity prices and heightened public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal-fired power plants similar to EME's, which may require significant capital and increased operating costs to meet environmental requirements. Management has reviewed long-term cash flow forecasts that included assumptions about future electricity and fuel prices, future capacity payments under the PJM RPM, and future capital expenditure requirements under different scenarios. Assumptions included in the long-term cash flow forecasts included:   

Observable market prices for electricity and fuel to the extent available and long-term prices developed based on a fundamental price model;   

Long-term capacity prices based on the assumption that the PJM RPM capacity market would continue consistent with its current structure, with expected increases in revenue as a result of declines in reserve margins beyond the price of the latest auctions; and   

Multiple plans for compliance with environmental regulations.  

If commodity prices do not increase consistent with the fundamental forecast or if EME decides not to install additional environmental control equipment and, instead, shuts down one or more coal-fired power plants, the forecasted cash flow would be less than expected. If the undiscounted expected cash flow measured at a plant level were less than the net book value of the asset group, an impairment charge would be recognized. The amount of an impairment charge would be calculated as the excess of the net book value of the asset group over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group.  

If EME decides to implement an environmental compliance plan that results in shutting down one or more coal-fired power plants or results in a shorter useful life, in addition to preparing an impairment analysis and possibly recording a related impairment of the plant, the remaining useful life of the plant would need to be adjusted to reflect the revised shorter life. The impact on annual depreciation could be significant.  

EME includes allocated acquired emission allowances as part of each power plant asset group. In the case of the Powerton and Joliet Stations, EME also includes prepaid rent in the respective asset group. EME's unit of account is at the plant level and, accordingly, the closure of a unit at a multi-unit site would not result in an impairment of property, plant and equipment unless such condition were to affect an impairment assessment on the entire plant.  

 Accounting for Contingencies, Guarantees and Indemnities 

 Nature of Estimates Required. Edison International records loss contingencies when it determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into, Edison International records a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification. Gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized.  

139 

Table of Contents 

 Key Assumptions and Approach Used. The determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter, including the analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility, Edison International may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases. Edison International provides disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. Some guarantees and indemnifications could have a significant financial impact under certain circumstances, and management also considers the probability of such circumstances occurring when estimating the fair value.  

 Effect if Different Assumptions Used. Actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, for guarantees and indemnities actual results may differ from the amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on Edison International's consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of contingencies, guarantees and indemnities, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies."
