Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and global competitiveness of the United States. America is once again poised for a period of growth in manufacturing, as the economy continues to recover. The U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise along with the need to reduce highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. CSX and freight railroads are the best way to meet this demand while reducing environmental impacts. CSX can move a ton of freight almost 500 miles on one gallon of fuel and, on average, over three times more fuel efficiently than trucks. 

CSX's network is positioned to reach nearly two-thirds of Americans, who account for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of products and commodities to meet the country's needs. These products range from energy sources like coal and ethanol, to automobiles, chemicals, building materials, paper, metals, grains and consumer products.  The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, coal and intermodal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries across the United States with each other and with global markets to meet the transportation needs of port facilities, energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States armed forces. 

CSX services are delivered by dedicated employees whose jobs cannot be exported overseas. Railroad jobs are among some of the nation's highest paying. In 2011, CSX continued its job creation efforts by hiring more than 4,000 new employees that will carry forward with this legacy.

Strategic Growth Initiatives

As CSX continues to strengthen its core business, the Company is focusing on three key strategic growth initiatives related to intermodal, export coal and total service integration. The Company believes these initiatives will allow it to capture additional domestic and international volume, while improving service offerings to its customers in a cost-effective manner. 

The Company's intermodal business is an economical, environmentally-friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX is capitalizing on this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity. Construction of a new intermodal terminal in Louisville, Kentucky and major terminal expansion projects such as the Worcester, Massachusetts and Columbus, Ohio terminals are currently underway. These investments are in addition to the Company's new Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal that became operational during first quarter 2011. This high-capacity terminal, which is part of CSX's National Gateway initiative discussed below, expands service offerings to customers as well as improves market access to and from east coast ports. 

Rapid economic growth in developing countries such as India, China and Brazil has generated a long term growth cycle in export coal demand. As a result of the increase in global steel production, demand for U.S. coal is expected to remain strong. Demand for coal used in electric power generation is also expected to remain high due to rising consumption as developing countries become more urbanized. These increases in global coal demand are expected to largely be met by export shipments with a considerable portion originating from the U.S. The Company is well-positioned to capitalize on this market growth through its network access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities.

PART II

CSX's Total Service Integration (“TSI”) initiative, which was launched in 2006, supports growth by improving service, optimizing train size, and increasing asset utilization for unit train shipments from origin to destination. CSX is now advancing this initiative to enhance service quality for customers who ship by the carload. This program, TSI Carload, focuses where the customer is impacted most - during the first and last mile of service. These enhancements aim to improve service levels and reliability of rail transportation over other modes of transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service will better align the Company's operating capabilities with customers' needs. 

Balanced Approach to Capital Deployment

CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying capital that includes investments in infrastructure, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2011, the Company invested $2.3 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. Included in this amount is approximately $100 million of investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend nine times over the last six year period which represents a 36 percent compounded annual growth rate. Also during 2011, CSX announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authority expected to be completed by the end of 2012 based on market and business conditions.

Public-Private Partnerships

Expanding capacity on U.S. rail networks will provide substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are working jointly to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity on key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest. Current projects related to the National Gateway include the expansion of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel in Washington, D.C. and construction for double-stack train clearances in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Columbia.

CSX is engaged in another major partnership initiative with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to expand freight and commuter rail service. Currently, CSX provides service to and from New England. To further improve that service offering to customers, CSX is expanding its intermodal terminal footprint in Worcester, Massachusetts and, with the Commonwealth, is clearing the route from Worcester to the New York state line for double-stack intermodal service. 

Additionally, CSX has entered into a transaction with the state of Florida to help alleviate highway congestion through a new commuter rail operation known as SunRail. CSX sold the state a portion of its track for its new commuter rail and will invest the proceeds in additional freight rail capacity and infrastructure within the state. This includes a new automotive and intermodal facility in central Florida. 

In summary, these long-term investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth and productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies.

2011 HIGHLIGHTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2011, the Company achieved positive year-over-year volume and revenue results as demand for rail service in the markets CSX serves continued to support profitable growth. Revenue increased 10% from prior year, to $11.7 billion, with growth in all three major markets - merchandise, coal and intermodal. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in all markets.

Expenses increased by $760 million, or 10%, from prior year. This increase was driven primarily by higher fuel prices, inflation and other labor-related costs associated with increased resource levels and training costs focused on service improvements. Although expenses increased year-over-year, CSX was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 70.9% due to the Company's continued focus on cost control and strong top line growth. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011. This activity did not have a material impact on the Company's full year 2010 results of operations.

For additional information, refer to Results of Operations discussed on pages 34 through 37.

PART II

In addition to the financial highlights described above, the Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, initiatives and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement. The programs utilize operating rules training, compliance measurement, root cause analysis and communication that are intended to create a safer environment for employees and the public. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.

The Company routinely collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives. For example, CSX, Operation Lifesaver, Inc., the U.S. Department of Transportation and other major railroads from across the country have partnered in the Common Sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and deaths around tracks and trains. In addition to these initiatives, CSXT also has an ongoing public safety program to clear-cut trees and vegetation at public passive highway-rail intersections (crossings with no flashing lights or gates) to improve the public's ability to discern rail hazards.

 During 2011, the Company's safety metrics improved. For 2011, the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) personal injury rate improved 10% to 0.91, compared to 1.01 in 2010. This is a record full year personal injury performance for CSX. The 2011 reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 14% to 2.32, compared to 2.69 in 2010. These improvements were achieved through a sustained commitment to safety.

Key service measures in 2011 slightly declined as the impact of severe weather on first half 2011 operations were partially offset by improvements gained from additional resources added in the second half of 2011. On-time train originations declined to 72% from 75% in 2010 while on-time arrivals declined to 62% from 69% in 2010. Dwell time increased to 25.9 hours from 25.0 hours in 2010. Average train velocity declined 2% to 20.6 miles per hour. While these key measures declined on a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter 2011 measures were markedly improved, and continue to support efficient and reliable train operations for CSX's customers.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends decreased $94 million to $1.4 billion.

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Property additions include investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships. These investments of approximately $100 million in 2011 are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. Also, property additions for 2009 above do not include cash payments of new assets using seller financing of approximately $160 million. These payments are shown in "other financing activities" on the consolidated cash flow statement.

34
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

2011 vs. 2010 Results of Operations

CSX full year results reflect positive year-over-year volume and revenue growth as demand for rail service in the markets CSX serves continued to support profitable growth. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in all markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011.

Volume and Revenue

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products – Volume declined as the amount of feed shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and decreased production from producers of poultry and pork. These reductions were slightly offset by growth in ethanol and increased shipments of soybeans into the Southeast due to low inventories. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Shipments of domestic fertilizers grew as farmers replenished inventories to improve crop yields as a result of higher anticipated crop prices. Export demand was also strong with recovery in exports to Central and South America after last year's drought. Shipments of phosphate rock, which is used to make fertilizer, grew as suppliers are stocking up in anticipation of a strong spring season.

Food and Consumer – Volume decreased as lower appliance shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing sector was partially offset by strength in truckload conversions of refrigerated products and manufactured goods.

Industrial

Chemicals – Volume was flat as strength in frac sand (used in the extraction of gas and petroleum) resulted from the increase in natural gas drilling. This increase was offset by a reduction in basic chemical markets, like plastics, which experienced weak consumer demand and inventory destocking.

Automotive - Automotive volume grew as North American automotive production increased to meet pent up demand from delayed purchases during the slowed economy over the last few years.

Metals – Volume growth was driven by strong export demand for scrap shipments and higher domestic steel production resulting from strong demand in the automotive and oil and gas sectors for products such as sheet steel and pipe.

Housing and Construction

Emerging Markets – Volume increased primarily driven by improved shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel), cement and waste (such as construction and demolition debris) as a result of new distribution facilities and overall market growth related to the improving economy. 

Forest Products – Volume increased, despite the weakness in housing-related markets, primarily related to strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products and increased shipments of building products resulting from inventory replenishments.

35
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Coal

Shipments of utility coal declined as electrical generation declined in the eastern U.S., natural gas prices remained low and utility stockpiles were above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by greater demand for U.S. coal in Europe, South America and Asia. During 2011, CSX shipped 40.2 million tons of export coal. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, positive mix and fuel recovery. 

Intermodal

International and domestic shipment growth resulted from expanded service offerings, over-the-road conversions, and service and network enhancements. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by increased fuel recovery, improved yields and favorable traffic mix. This revenue-per-unit increase was partially offset by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program in the prior year. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation.

Other

Other revenue increased due to stronger affiliate revenue and higher incidental charges mostly offset by lower benefits for contract volume commitments as compared to the prior year. 

Expense

In 2011, total expenses increased $760 million or 10% to $8.3 billion compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $116 million primarily driven by inflation, increased resource levels and other labor-related costs associated with training focused on service improvements partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. In addition, this category includes amounts paid to other transportation companies. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $154 million in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the following:

•Volume-related expenses and inflation increased as a result of higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. Additionally, maintenance expense increased due to a higher active count of locomotives in service as compared to prior year. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase. 

•Casualty expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to the prior year benefit of $49 million not repeated in the current year. This benefit was a result of improvements in safety and occupational claim trends.

36
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

•Expense increases were partially offset by approximately $37 million of reduced transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program in 2010. Additionally, an operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. 

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $456 million primarily due to a 26% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.80 from $2.26 in 2010 to $3.06 in 2011.

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $29 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending partially offset by a multi-year adjustment related to retirements as well as the impact of prior year's additional expense related to the extra week.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $5 million primarily due to volume-related expenses partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization. 

Other

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $5 million to $552 million primarily due to lower average interest rates offset by higher average debt balances during 2011.

Other Income – Net

Other income - net decreased $10 million to $22 million related to lower real estate sales and increased non-operating expenses.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $83 million to $1.1 billion due to higher earnings during 2011 offset by certain state income tax related adjustments compared to a year ago.

Net Earnings

Net earnings increased $259 million to $1.8 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.32 to $1.67 in 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2011.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

2010 vs. 2009 Results of Operations

CSX full year results reflect continued strong year-over-year volume and revenue growth as a result of the improving economy. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in most markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2009.

Volume and Revenue

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products – Volume grew with increased shipments of feed grains and ethanol. Shipments of feed grains improved with expanded meat production and lower wheat imports. Ethanol shipments grew as the amount of ethanol in fuel continued to increase.

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Volume increased as a result of strength in demand for domestic fertilizers due to a strong planting season and due to replenishment of low inventories.

Food and Consumer – Volume increased slightly as strength in refrigerated products, primarily fruits and vegetables, and alcoholic beverages were partially offset by weakness in demand for appliances.

Industrial

Chemicals – Growth occurred across most markets reflecting improvement in demand for intermediate products used in manufacturing automobiles and consumer goods. Many plastics and chemicals are key inputs in the production of both durable and nondurable goods, as well as packaging.

Automotive – Strong growth was driven by an increase in North American light-vehicle production in response to increased demand in the improving economy. 

Metals – Volume growth was driven by increased shipments of sheet steel for auto production, increases in scrap steel resulting from higher steel production and increases in energy-related products.

Housing and Construction

Emerging Markets – Shipments increased in limestone, transportation equipment and aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) as a result of overall market growth due to the improving economy.

Forest Products – Volume increased with strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products. Volume also increased slightly in construction-related markets.

39
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Coal

Volume was basically flat as increased export shipments were offset by weakness in utility shipments. Higher export shipments were due to greater demand for U.S. metallurgical coal in Asia and steam coal in Europe. Shipments to utility customers were down as high utility stockpiles were reduced throughout the year and are approaching targeted levels. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, higher fuel recovery and longer length of haul. 

Intermodal

International and domestic shipment growth resulted from U.S. inventory replenishment, improved U.S. exports, new business, truckload conversions, and new UMAX and door-to-door service offerings.

The revenue-per-unit decline was driven by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program at the start of second quarter. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation. This revenue-per-unit decline was partly offset by increased fuel recovery and an improved pricing environment.

Other

Revenue gains were primarily driven by benefits for contract volume commitments not met.

Expense

Total expenses for 2010 increased 12% or $794 million to $7.6 billion compared to the prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $328 million primarily driven by inflation and higher incentive compensation.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. In addition, this category includes amounts paid to other transportation companies. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $76 million in 2010. This increase was primarily driven by the following:

•Volume increases drove higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. In addition, maintenance expenses increased as locomotives previously held in storage during 2009 due to lower volume were placed back into service during 2010. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase.

•As safety and occupational claim trends have continued to improve, changes in estimate were recorded in both years - $49 million in 2010 and $105 million in 2009. This resulted in a year-over-year increase in casualty expense of $56 million.

•An operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. This property is a former Conrail-acquired property. The Company received $50 million of cash related to this transaction.

40
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

•The above increases to expense were offset by $126 million of reduced purchased transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program during 2010 in the intermodal business.

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $363 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and higher volume. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.55 or 32% from $1.71 in 2009 to $2.26 in 2010.

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $44 million in 2010 primarily due to a larger asset base.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $17 million primarily due to cost savings associated with improved asset utilization and lower lease expense, partially offset by volume-related increases.

Other

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $1 million to $557 million primarily due to lower average debt balances during 2010.

Other Income – Net

Other income decreased $2 million to $32 million primarily related to lower interest income caused by lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates in 2010.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $365 million to $983 million primarily due to higher earnings during 2010.

Net Earnings

Net earnings increased $420 million to $1.6 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.39 to $1.35 in 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2010.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows

Consolidated Balance Sheets

CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.

Total assets increased $1.3 billion from prior year. Assets increased primarily due to the increase in net properties of $1.2 billion from planned capital spending as well as short-term investments grew $469 million. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cash of $509 million.

Total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined increased $1.3 billion primarily due to the net increase in total debt of $577 million mostly due to additional borrowings. Deferred income tax liability also increased by $548 million primarily related to the net impact of bonus depreciation on tax accruals. Shareholders' equity decreased by $232 million as a result of $1.6 billion of share repurchases since December 2010 partially offset by increased earnings during 2011.

Sources of Cash

The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2011, the Company generated $3.5 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a $230 million increase from prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in 2011. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.

CSX filed its shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2010. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.

Uses of Cash

CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2011, net cash used in investing activities was driven by $2.3 billion of property additions which increased $457 million from prior year. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Total capital expenditures shown above include investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships. These investments of approximately $100 million in 2011 are projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through either government grants or other funding sources such as cash received from a property sale. These reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year; therefore the timing of receipts may differ from the timing of the investment. 

(b)Cash paid for new assets purchased using seller financing shown above in 2009 was for locomotives and freight cars and are included in “other financing activities” on the consolidated cash flow statement.

In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders. CSX paid dividends of $480 million in 2011, which was $108 million more than prior year. This increase was due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share at the beginning of 2011 and then to $0.12 in second quarter 2011. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion which increased $186 million primarily as a result of $1.6 billion of share repurchases partially offset by net debt in 2011.

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations. Although new legislation or regulations, such as the STB Reauthorization Bill or climate change legislation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K), it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact.

Liquidity and Working Capital

Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with over $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX also replaced its existing credit facility that was set to expire in May 2012 with a new $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016. The Company has no outstanding balances under this facility as of the date of this filing. Additionally in 2011, CSX issued a total of $1.2 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, improvements in productivity, dividends to shareholders, debt repayments and repurchases of CSX common stock. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. 

The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364-day term and expires in December 2012. The Company plans to renew this facility prior to its expiration. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements.

Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $248 million and $318 million at December 2011 and 2010, respectively. This lower surplus since the prior year is primarily due to a deferred gain included in current liabilities. See sources and uses of cash description above.

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

Currently, CSX is rated BBB with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a positive outlook by Moody's. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:

•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;

•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;

•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and

•income taxes 

Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves

Casualty

Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. During 2010 the Company increased its self-insured retention amount for these claims from $25 million to $50 million per injury for claims occurring on or after June 1, 2010. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.

Most of the claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.

As of December 2011, the Company had $372 million in casualty reserves. See below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves.

Personal Injury

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.

46
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.

During 2011, there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves. During 2010, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $24 million due to a downward trend in the number of injuries. This downward trend was measured by the reduction of the CSXT's Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) personal injury rate. Adjustments to the reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Occupational & Asbestos

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (from exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.

The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.

Occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party actuary or specialist (the "third-party specialist"), respectively, in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Analyses of both types of claims are performed by the third-party specialist and reviewed by management. This review is quarterly for occupational claims and annually for asbestos claims. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, this review is completed annually. For asserted occupational and asbestos claims, management reviews quarterly. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.

The third-party specialists analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX employment records and industry data From this analysis, the third-party specialists provide an estimate of the IBNR claims liability.

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims.

47
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

During 2011, there were no significant changes in estimate recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves. During 2010, the Company reduced occupational reserves by $12 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of repetitive stress injury claims and lower settlement values for irritant claims. Also during 2010, the Company reduced its reserves for asbestos claims by $13 million, primarily related to a significant number of claims that were determined to have no value due to lack of sufficient medical evidence. Adjustments in reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Environmental

The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 246 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.

In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:

•type of clean-up required;

•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);

•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and

•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

As of December 2011, the Company had $83 million in environmental reserves. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations.

Legal

In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards.

See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.  As of December 2011, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $2.7 billion. CSX did not make contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011 or 2010.

49
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a self-insured post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:

•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;

•long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•salary scale inflation rates;

•health care cost trend rates; and

•other assumptions.

The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, salary scale inflation rates and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.

Discount Rates

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2011 pension and post-retirement obligations are 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. For 2010, the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 5.0% and 4.5%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2011, the estimated duration of pensions and post retirement benefits is approximately 11 years and 7 years, respectively.

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 8% and 8.25% in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Salary Scale Inflation Rates

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4% to value its 2011 and 2010 pension obligations.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The 2011 and 2010 assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 8.5% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and 8% for Medicare-eligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5% in 2018, based upon current actuarial projections. However, the year-to-year comparisons may fluctuate.

Other Assumptions

The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management.

2012 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense

Net pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $85 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to $73 million and $19 million, respectively, in 2011. The increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2011 and the decrease in the discount rate (which causes expense to increase), partially offset by the return on anticipated discretionary contributions.

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2011 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method

The Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 85% of total fixed assets of $34 billion on a gross basis at December 2011. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.

The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. 

The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.

Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.

52
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.

There are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include:

•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;

•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;

•evaluation of current operations;

•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;

•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;

•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and

•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the life study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.

In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).

Recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $976 million and $947 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. The Company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road, track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of $11 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2009.

Income Taxes

CSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2009. The federal income tax return for 2010 currently is under review. During 2011, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2011. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2011, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $22 million.
