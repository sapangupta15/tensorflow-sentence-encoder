Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs. As of December 2009, the Company had $20 million outstanding in interest rate swap agreements. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these swaps would cause less than a $1 million change in interest expense. 

At December 2009, CSX had $78 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a $1 million change in interest expense.
