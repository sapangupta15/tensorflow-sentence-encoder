Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

 Interest Rate Risk  

 We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates.  

 We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.  

 Fiscal 2008  

 As of June 28, 2008, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our long-term debt obligations as of June 28, 2008 were $1,980,331,000, of which approximately 99% were at fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of June 28, 2008.  

 The following table presents our interest rate position as of June 28, 2008. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents.

 Fiscal 2007  

 As of June 30, 2007, we had outstanding $531,826,000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through September 24, 2007. Excluding commercial paper issuances, our long-term debt obligations as of June 30, 2007 were $1,229,969,000, of which approximately 99% were at fixed rates of interest. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of June 30, 2007.

 In the following table as of June 30, 2007, commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long-term based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long-term basis.  

 The following table presents our interest rate position as of June 30, 2007. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

 We have Canadian subsidiaries, all of which use the Canadian dollar as their functional currency with the exception of a financing subsidiary. To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in Canadian dollars, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses within shareholdersÂ’ equity due to translation of the financial statements from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Our Canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in U.S. dollars, which has the potential to create taxable income in Canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2008 year-end exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks.  

 Fuel Price Risk  

 The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.6%, 0.6% and 0.5% of sales, respectively. Fuel costs, excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, incurred by SYSCO increased by approximately $34,023,000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and $21,225,000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.  

 From time to time, we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of June 28, 2008, we had no outstanding forward diesel fuel purchase commitments. In July and August 2008, we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately $195,000,000 through July 2009, which will lock in the price on approximately 50% of our fuel purchases through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 and approximately 70% of our fuel purchases needs for the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2009.  

 If fuel prices continue at current levels, fuel costs in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009, exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to increase by approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000 as compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008. Our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel mid-August 2008, the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. A 10% unfavorable or favorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to $50,000,000 to $70,000,000.
