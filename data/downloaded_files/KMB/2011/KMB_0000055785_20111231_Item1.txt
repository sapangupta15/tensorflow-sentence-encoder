ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Kimberly-Clark Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. We are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life through product innovation and building our personal care, consumer tissue, K-C Professional & Other and health care brands. We are principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of products mostly made from natural or synthetic fibers using advanced technologies in fibers, nonwovens and absorbency. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Corporation,” “Kimberly‑Clark,” “K-C,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

For financial information by business segment and geographic area, including revenue, profit and total assets of each reportable segment, and information about our principal products and markets, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and Item 8, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Developments

On January 21, 2011, we adopted a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and K‑C Professional businesses. In addition, on January 24, 2012, we announced our decision to streamline an additional manufacturing facility in North America to further enhance the profitability of our consumer tissue business. Both restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2012. For additional information, see MD&A and Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Description of Kimberly-Clark

We are organized into operating segments based on product groupings. These operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable global business segments. Information on these four segments, as well as their principal sources of revenue, is included below.

•Personal Care brands offer parents a trusted partner in caring for their families and deliver confidence, protection and discretion to adults through a wide variety of innovative solutions and products such as disposable diapers, training and youth pants, swimpants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products, and other related products. Products in this segment are sold under the Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, Kotex, Lightdays, Depend, Poise and other brand names.

•Consumer Tissue offers a wide variety of innovative solutions and trusted brands that touch and improve people's lives every day. Products in this segment include facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products, and are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Hakle, Page and other brand names.

•K-C Professional & Other helps transform workplaces for employees and patrons, making them healthier, safer, and more productive, through a range of solutions and supporting products such as apparel, wipers, soaps, sanitizers, tissues, and towels. Key brands in this segment include Kleenex, Scott, WypAll, Kimtech, and Jackson Safety. 

•Health Care provides the essentials that help restore patients to better health and improve the quality of patients' lives. Through a portfolio of innovative medical device and infection prevention products, Health Care offers clinicians a range of solutions in pain management, respiratory and digestive health and medical supplies for the operating room. This business is a global leader in education to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Products are sold primarily under the Kimberly-Clark and ON-Q brand names.

These reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our chief operating decision maker and our executive managers develop and execute our global strategies to drive growth and profitability of our worldwide Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, K-C Professional & Other and Health Care operations. These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses.

Products for household use are sold directly to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, warehouse clubs, variety and department stores and other retail outlets, and through other distributors and the Internet. Products for away-from-home use are sold through distributors and directly to manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, health care establishments and high volume public facilities.

Net sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were approximately 12 percent in 2011, and 13 percent in both 2010 and 2009.

Patents and Trademarks

We own various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries. We consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products to be material to our business. Consequently, we seek patent and trademark protection by all available means, including registration.

Raw Materials

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered waste paper, is the primary raw material for our tissue products and is a component of disposable diapers, training pants, feminine pads and incontinence care products.

Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics, which are used in disposable diapers, training and youth pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence and health care products, and away-from-home wipers. Superabsorbent materials are important components of disposable diapers, training and youth pants and incontinence care products. 

Most raw materials are purchased from third parties, and we consider the supply to be adequate to meet the needs of our businesses. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Competition

We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than us. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. For additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are directed toward new or improved personal care, tissue, wiping, safety and health care products and nonwoven materials. Consolidated research and development expense was $316 million in 2011, $317 million in 2010 and $301 million in 2009.

Foreign Market Risks

We operate and market our products globally, and our business strategy includes targeted growth in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with a particular emphasis in China, Russia and Latin America. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of foreign market risks that may affect our financial results.
