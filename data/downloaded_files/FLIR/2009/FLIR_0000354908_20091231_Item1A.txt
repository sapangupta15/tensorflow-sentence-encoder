ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

The following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. If we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective.  

General economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition  

Our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending and the recent worldwide recession has negatively impacted demand in many of our markets. These markets may remain weak, or be subject to further deterioration. Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the Companys products include continued uncertainty about current global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers and suppliers access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior.  

Our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable  

Our business depends on the demand for our thermal imaging systems in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. In the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:  

       the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders;  

       variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter;  

       the size and timing of new contract awards;  

       the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and  

       the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter.  

Seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, particularly the increase in sales we generally experience in the fourth quarter, result from:  

       the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States government and certain foreign governments;  

       the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to January due to funding considerations; and  

       the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration.  

12  

We depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business  

We derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts with United States government agencies. A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 43 percent, 41 percent and 39 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from contracts with the United States government and its agencies. Recently, a higher percentage of our contracts have been larger Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall United States government budget and appropriation process, which is beyond our control. In addition, at its discretion, the United States government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts.  

As a United States government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations  

Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by United States government agencies. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently.  

Our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets  

The markets in which we compete, including the thermal imaging industry, are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. Our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. We will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. If we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products.  

We must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization  

As the Company has grown, the size and scope of the Companys worldwide operations have also increased substantially. Worldwide operations have grown to accommodate the design, manufacture and marketing of numerous product lines across all of our divisions in a vertically integrated manufacturing environment. Significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business. In December 2009, we announced a reorganization whereby we would consolidate the Thermography Division and the Commercial Systems Division into one division, called Commercial Systems, effective January 1, 2010. Our failure to successfully manage the global operations and integration of the two divisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities as described in Item 2. Our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

We face risks from international sales and business activities  

We market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and  

13  

 2007, international sales accounted for 41 percent, 38 percent and 39 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. We also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in Europe. Our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including:  

       the imposition of and changes to governmental controls;  

       restrictions on the export of critical technology;  

       trade restrictions;  

       difficulty in collecting receivables;  

       inadequate protection of intellectual property;  

       labor union activities;  

       changes in tariffs and taxes;  

       restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services;  

       compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;  

       difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and  

       political and economic instability.  

No assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales  

Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. Some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the Company. In addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. As a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. Accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. Any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs.  

Competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business  

Competition in the markets for our products is intense. The speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. All of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. No assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

14  

Dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand, increased costs and loss of revenue  

We currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. We have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components, in particular, cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, optics and optical coatings, and laser components, but we rely on sole or limited source third-party suppliers for other key components including laser rangefinders, certain machined parts, optics, motors and electronic components. Many of these suppliers are small and we are often one of their most important customers. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to source certain of these components on a timely basis or if such components are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards.  

Based on past experience, we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components. If critical components provided by any significant supplier become unavailable, our manufacturing operations could be disrupted. Unless we have sufficient lead-time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components, we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. Any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel  

Our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. Significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. We cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  

We may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations  

We have made several acquisitions of various sizes during our history, including eleven in the past seven years. Our most recent acquisitions include Salvador, OmniTech, and Directed Perception in 2009. The integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. For example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. Any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue.  

We frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. Such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. Any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. Furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. Additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership. No assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

15  

We may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets  

Our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. As of December 31, 2009, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $321.5 million and represented 22 percent of our total assets. Most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. We amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. To date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. In addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. We depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

We are exposed to worldwide financial markets  

Financial markets are volatile. Changes in the availability of credit and the perceived and actual market risk of financial instruments can have numerous potential adverse effects, including the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, the insolvency of customers resulting in reduced sales and bad debts, and the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product development and production delays. We invest our cash and cash equivalents in instruments that may be exposed to credit and market risk, including default, the failure of financial institutions and market illiquidity.  

We face risks from currency fluctuations  

Historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. Changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. We seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in United States dollars, and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. With respect to international sales denominated in United States dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar could make our products less price competitive.  

Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business  

Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. Although we currently hold United States patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours.  

16  

Litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. We have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. Similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. Lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. An adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. Additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. If such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the United States government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments  

Export licenses are required from United States government agencies under the Export Administration Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 for export of many of our products. We can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. Recently, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. Failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the United States and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims  

We include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms.  

We have indebtedness as a result of the sale of our convertible notes and are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our credit facility which may limit our operational and financial flexibility  

In June 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0 percent senior convertible notes due in 2023 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of which as of December 31, 2009, approximately $58.8 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes were outstanding.  

Additionally, we have a $300 million revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, in addition to minimum levels of EBITDA and consolidated net worth, a maximum level of capital expenditures and, commencing December 31, 2009, a minimum level of liquidity comprised of cash and undrawn/unutilized availability under the credit agreement. The credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. As of December 31, 2009, there were no amounts borrowed and outstanding under the credit agreement. The credit agreement expires on October 6, 2011.  

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement. In the event of any such default, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the  

17  

 facility to be due and immediately payable. If we are unable to repay any of this debt when due, the lenders under our credit facility could foreclose on our assets pledged to them as security.  

Changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:  

       the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;  

       the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;  

       changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;  

       adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;  

       increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;  

       changes in available tax credits;  

       changes in share-based compensation expense;  

       changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or  

       the repatriation of earnings from outside the United States for which we have not previously provided for United States taxes.  

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. In addition, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor.  

Oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders  

Other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. An acquisition or merger of our Company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. Some provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of Oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable.
