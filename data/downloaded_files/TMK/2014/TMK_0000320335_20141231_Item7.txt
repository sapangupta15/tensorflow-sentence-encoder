Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Torchmarks Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

How Torchmark Views Its Operations: Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, health, Medicare Part D, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment. As described in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we reorganized our segment structure to separate our Medicare Part D health insurance business from our other health insurance activities as a stand-alone segment, because management determined that Part D meets the criteria of a distinct segment under accounting guidance. Prior period results have been retrospectively adjusted for comparability.  

Insurance Product Line Segments. As fully explained in Note 14, the insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and the administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:  

Premium revenue  

Less:  

 Policy obligations  

 Policy acquisition costs and commissions  

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:  

Net investment income  

Less:  

 Required interest on net policy liabilities  

 Financing costs  

The tables in Note 14 reconcile Torchmarks revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ending December 31, 2014. Additionally, this Note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and which reconciles to net income. That summary is reproduced below from the Consolidated Financial Statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business.  

Acquisition: On November 1, 2012, we acquired Family Heritage, a previously privately-held supplemental health insurance carrier. Information about this acquisition can be found in Note 6Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of Family Heritage subsequent to our acquisition are included in this discussion within our health insurance segment.

 ** See the discussion of Realized Gains and Losses in this report.  

Torchmarks operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.  

Summary of Operations: Net income was $543 million in 2014, compared with $528 million in 2013. Net income declined slightly in 2013 from $529 million in 2012. On a diluted per share basis, 2014 net income rose 8% to $4.09 after a 5% increase in 2013. Net income per diluted share in 2013 rose to $3.79 from $3.60 in 2012. The per-share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. Also, each years per share net income was affected by realized investment gains, which were $0.12, $0.03, and $0.17 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. More information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion. Also, as explained in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, we do not consider non-operating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments as indicated in the chart above to be part of our segment operating income.  

As shown in the above chart, after-tax segment results of operations rose each year over the prior year from $507 million in 2012 to $531 million in 2013 to $534 million in 2014. The primary contributor to the growth in both 2014 and 2013 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment, in which margins rose $11 million in 2014 and $36 million in 2013. The life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented. Also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment, which provided $3 million of additional margin in 2014 and $33 million in 2013. The 2013 larger increase in health margin was primarily due to the inclusion of Family Heritages health business for a full year since its acquisition in late 2012. Family Heritage accounted for $32 million of the increase in 2013 margin. Margins for the Medicare Part D segment declined 23% in 2014 to $27 million, primarily due to two costly Hepatitis C drugs which were not required to be covered until well after our 2014 pricing was finalized, as discussed more fully later in this report.  

Excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, increased to $225 million or 3% over the prior year amount of $219 million. This was the first time in four years the dollar  

18

 amount of excess investment income exceeded the prior years amount. In 2013, excess investment income declined 8%. Although interest rates rebounded slightly during the first half of 2014, the low interest rate environment continued to pressure investment yields and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the three-year period. Excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursement of Medicare Part D costs. The effects of the low-interest-rate environment and the impact of the Part D business on investment income is discussed more fully later in this report under the caption Investments.  

The inclusion of Family Heritages administrative expenses for a full year for the first time added $8 million of additional administrative expense in 2013. In addition, in both 2014 and 2013, there were increases in stock compensation expense which negatively affected the results during the year. Stock compensation increased $7 million in 2014 and $4 million in 2013. These increases in stock compensation expense resulted primarily from the increase in the value of Torchmarks stock rather than an increase in the number of grants.  

Total revenues rose 5% in 2014 to $3.96 billion, after having risen 5% in 2013 to $3.77 billion. Life premium rose 4% or $81 million in 2014 to $1.97 billion. Life premium increased $77 million in 2013 to $1.89 billion. Net investment income rose $16 million in 2013, and rose 3% or $19 million in 2014. Health premium increased 7% to $1.24 billion in 2014 and contributed $76 million to 2014 revenue growth, after having gained 11% to $1.17 billion in 2013. Health premium contributed $119 million to 2013 revenue growth.  

Life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the three years ending December 31. The increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency. While premium and underwriting margins grew, margin as a percent of premium fell slightly in 2014 to 28%, after increasing from 28% to 29% from 2012 to 2013. These fluctuations were due primarily to changes in mortality. Net life sales increased 12% in 2014 to $378 million after decreasing 1% in 2013. The life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption Life Insurance.  

With regard to health insurance, we primarily market Medicare Supplement insurance, other limited-benefit products including cancer, and accident and health products. As noted earlier, 2013 and 2014 health premiums were positively affected by the inclusion of Family Heritages health premium for the full years. The inclusion of Family Heritage also caused our limited-benefit health premium, which is their primary focus, to exceed our Medicare Supplement premium in 2013 for the first time in several years. Prior to 2013, Medicare Supplement was our largest contributor to total health premium. Limited-benefit health continued to exceed Medicare Supplement in 2014. Limited-benefit health premium was $446 million in 2014, compared with $447 million in 2013. Limited-benefit premium increased 50% over 2012 limited-benefit health premium of $298 million, a result of the inclusion of Family Heritages business. Medicare Supplement premium was $423 million in 2014, increasing over the prior years premium for the first time in many years, as lapses exceeded new sales in prior year periods. Medicare Supplement premium was $417 million in 2013 and $432 million in 2012. The increase in 2014 premium resulted from sales in 2014 to certain large groups. Health margins have remained somewhat stable as a percentage of premium throughout the three-year period. See the discussion under Health Insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.  

We also market Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance. Our Medicare Part D premium rose 16% in 2014 to $348 million, compared with $300 million in 2013 and $318 million in 2012. The higher premiums in both 2014 and 2012 were due to higher levels of low-income auto-enrollees in our plans for those years. Due to increased competition in the 2013 plan year, we experienced a decrease in 2013 Part D premium. Medicare Part D margins were negatively impacted in 2014, however, by several factors, including two high cost Hepatitis C drugs, the coverage of which was mandated by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in early 2014, well after our 2014 pricing was finalized, new taxes under the Affordable Care Act, and other higher drug costs due to rebate restructuring. As a percentage of premium, margins fell from 12% in 2013 to 8% in 2014. For the 2015 plan year, we will have a significantly lower number of auto-enrollees which should reduce our exposure to Hepatitis C drug claims, because approximately 85% of these claims in 2014 were related to auto-enrollees. For more information on our Medicare Part D business, please refer to our discussion under the caption Medicare Part D.

We do not currently market annuities. See the caption Annuities for discussion of the Annuity segment.  

The investment segments pretax profitability, or excess investment income, is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In 2014, net investment income rose 3%, compared with 2% in 2013. As we view our segments, net investment income rose 3% in both periods. At the same time, our investment portfolio grew 3% and 9% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In recent years, net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio. One reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Also, there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, during which the funds are held in cash. Growth in total investment income is also somewhat negatively affected by Torchmarks share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. In 2014, net investment income was negatively impacted by events affecting our Medicare Part D business. Under the program, we are required to cover certain claim costs in the current period that are the federal governments responsibility, but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year. This delay in reimbursement substantially reduced our funds available for investment in 2014, with the result of reduced investment income in 2014 and 2015.  

The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. The lower new-money yields resulting from the low-interest-rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown. We have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect, including increasing premium rates on sales of new products as discussed under the caption Investments. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. Financing costs in 2013 were stable at $80 million, but declined 5% in 2014. The 2014 decline resulted from the maturity and repayment in 2013 of our $94.5 million principal amount 7 3/8% Notes.  

Torchmarks current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investment-grade securities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 97% of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96% were investment grade at December 31, 2014. The average quality rating of the portfolio was A-. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or other derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption Investments in this report and Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment.  

In 2012 and 2013, we engaged in a debt restructuring program which resulted in a reduction in financing costs. We issued two new debt offerings during 2012: our $300 million principal amount 3.8% Senior Notes due 2022 and our $125 million principal amount 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2052, both issued in September. Proceeds from the Senior Notes were $297 million, but $150 million were purchased by our insurance subsidiaries and were eliminated in consolidation. Proceeds from this offering provided funding for the retirement of our 7 3/8% Senior Notes, which matured and were repaid in August, 2013, and for the acquisition of Family Heritage in November, 2012. The $121 million net proceeds from the Subordinated Debentures were used to fund the call of our $120 million principal amount 7.1% Trust Originated Preferred Securities in October, 2012. More information on these transactions can be found in Note 6Acquisition and Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in our discussion of Capital Resources in this report.  

In each of the years 2012 through 2014, net income was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. As reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 under the caption Settlements, we were involved in certain issues in which we incurred settlement losses and expenses. In connection with the 2012 purchase of Family Heritage, as described in Note 6Acquisition, we incurred $2.9 million of acquisition-related expenses ($1.9 million after tax). During 2013, Torchmark incurred a state guaranty fund assessment in the amount of $1.2 million ($751 thousand after tax), resulting from events in years prior to 2012. Also in 2013, we resolved a legal matter related to a non-insurance issue in the amount of $500 thousand ($325 thousand after tax), and settled additional litigation related to prior years in the amount of $8.6 million ($5.6 million after tax). During 2014, Torchmark accrued for certain litigation matters in the net amount of $3.7 million ($2.4 million after tax) that were not directly related to its insurance operations. Additionally, Torchmark received $1.3 million ($853 thousand after tax) in settlement of litigation regarding investments. Also in 2014, the Company recorded $8.2 million in administrative settlements ($5.3 million after tax) related to benefits paid for deaths occurring in prior years where claims were not filed. All of these items have been expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, as described in Note 1, we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.  

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Companys excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. The Board of Directors has authorized the Companys share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2014.

Option proceeds were unusually high in 2012 due to option holders exercising several years of option grants that expired in 2012.  

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.  

A discussion of each of Torchmarks segments follows. The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in Note 14Business Segments.

Life Insurance. Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2014 life premium representing 62% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 71% of the total in 2014. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.  

Life insurance premium rose 4% to $1.97 billion in 2014 after having increased 4% in 2013 to $1.89 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:

Premium by Distribution Method  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: annualized premium in force, net sales, and first-year collected premium. Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.  

Annualized life premium in force was $2.04 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of 5% over $1.96 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.90 billion at December 31, 2012.

The American Income Exclusive Agency has historically focused primarily on marketing to members of labor unions. While the labor union market is still the backbone of American Incomes business, the agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help to ensure sustainable growth. It is Torchmarks highest margin business. The American Income Agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any Torchmark distribution method in 2014. Life premium for this agency rose 7% to $766 million, after having risen 8% in 2013. Net sales rose 13% in 2014 to $172 million, after having declined 4% in 2013. Net sales rose 12% in 2012. The average face amount of policies issued in 2014 was approximately $30 thousand. As is the case with all of Torchmarks agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. The American Income agent count was 6,434 at December 31, 2014 compared with 5,302 a year earlier, an increase of 21%. The agent count increased 2% in 2013 and 18% in 2012. The average agent count for 2014 was 5,868. The average agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the year. Managements primary objective is to grow middle management in the agency to help ensure sustainable growth. This is being achieved through an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel. We have also begun providing more home-office and webinar training programs. These programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level managers, coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individuals level of experience and responsibilities. We believe that these initiatives will continue to promote enthusiasm in the field and will drive increases in agent retention and sales activity.  

The Direct Response Unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. These different approaches support and complement one another in the units efforts to reach the consumer. The Direct Response Units growth has been fueled by constant innovation. In recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center.  

While the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time.  

The Direct Response operation accounted for 36% of our life insurance premium during 2014, increasing 6% over 2013 premium. Life premium for this unit rose 5% in 2013 and 6% in 2012. Net sales rose 10% to $158 million in 2014 after a 2% increase in 2013, due to growth in electronic media activity. First-year collected premium increased 8% to $100 million in 2014 and was flat in 2013 compared to 2012. The average face amount of policies issued in 2014 was approximately $17 thousand.

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency markets individual and group life insurance to middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was $272 million in 2014, a 1% decrease compared with $276 million in 2013. Life premium declined 2% in 2013 from 2012. First year collected premium increased 1% in 2014, however, after having declined 4% in 2013. The average face amount of life policies issued in 2014 was approximately $23 thousand.  

The Liberty National Agencys net sales rose 11% to $34 million in 2014, after having declined 4% a year earlier. The increase in net sales during 2014 marks the first increase in several years, reflecting changes in structure of the agency that management has put in place in recent years. As is the case with all of our agencies, sales are driven by the size of the agent force. The Liberty agency had 1,498 producing agents at December 31, 2014 compared with 1,430 a year earlier, an increase of 5%. The producing agent count increased 1% during 2013 from 1,419. The average agent count for 2014 was 1,505. Agent counts declined during the fourth quarter of 2014 as the agency focused somewhat less on recruiting, due to the increased emphasis on annual worksite renewals.  

Our long term plans to grow this agency involve expansion from small-town markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. We believe that expansion of this Agencys presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long term agency growth. Additionally, a prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business.  

We also offer life insurance through Other Agencies consisting of the Military Agency, the United American Independent Agency, and other small sales agencies. The Military Agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 9% of life premium at December 31, 2014. The United American Independent Agency represented approximately 1% of Torchmarks total life premium at that date, as their sales of Torchmark products consist primarily of health insurance.

Summary of Results  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross margins, as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 2% in 2014 and 7% in 2013. The margin increased to $556 million in 2014 after rising to $545 million in 2013. The steady growth in premium contributed to margin growth in all periods. As a percentage of premium, however, an increase in policy obligations resulted in a slightly lower margin in 2014. Policy obligations fluctuate from period to period as a result of mortality. In both 2013 and 2014, percentage margins were positively affected by our conservation program and the permitted increases in the deferrals of our internet-related direct response acquisition costs.

Health Insurance. Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement coverage to enrollees in the federal Medicare program, cancer coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. As discussed in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Medicare Part D is now reported as a separate Torchmark segment and is no longer included in the discussion of Torchmarks other health products. See the discussion of Medicare Part D later in this report. In this discussion of health business, all health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement are classified here as limited-benefit plans.  

Health premium represented 27% of Torchmarks total premium income in 2014, compared with 28% in 2013 and 26% in 2012. Health underwriting margin accounted for 25% of the total in 2014, compared with 25% in 2013 and 23% in 2012. Health results in 2014 and 2013 were positively affected by the late 2012 addition of Family Heritage. Family Heritage added $205 million and $191 million of health premium in 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared with $30 million in 2012. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

Health premium, rose 1% to $869 million in 2014, after having increased 18% in 2013 to $864 million. However, if the premium of Family Heritage were removed for comparability in 2013 and 2012, health premium would have declined 4% in 2013. The decline in 2013 premium resulted primarily from a run-off of a block of discontinued hospital-surgical plans. This runoff had been ongoing for a number of years. In 2014, this runoff is thought to have substantially run its course. Net sales increased 63% in 2014 to $181 million, after having increased 42% in 2013. The 2014 increase was caused by the more than double growth in Medicare Supplement sales. These sales occurred in both the United American Independent Agency and in the Direct Response Group. These increases were primarily the result of strong group sales of Medicare Supplement which can vary significantly from period to period. The 2013 increase was primarily a result of the acquisition of Family Heritage, which contributed $44 million to the growth in 2013 compared with $7 million in 2012. First-year collected premium increased 18% in 2014 and 47% in 2013, as a result of the increased sales in both 2014 and 2013, and the addition of Family Heritage first-year premium for a full year in 2013 for the first time.  

The addition of Family Heritages sales and premium from limited-benefit products has resulted in limited-benefit health premium exceeding Medicare Supplement premium income in 2013 for the first time in several years and continuing to lead in premium in 2014. However, due to increased Medicare Supplement group sales, Medicare Supplement net sales exceeded limited-benefit net sales in 2014. Limited-benefit premium represented 51% of total health premium in 2014 and 52% in 2013, but represented 41% in 2012. However, as noted above, Medicare Supplement sales rose 139% to $106

 million in 2014 due to the high group sales, which represented 59% of net health sales in 2014. Medicare Supplement sales were 40% of the total in 2013 and 59% in 2012. As mentioned previously, group Medicare Supplement sales fluctuate significantly from period to period.  

We do not expect recent health care reform activity to have a significant impact on our operations. We dont sell any products subject to the Affordable Care Act, and dont believe that consumer demand for the types of supplemental health products we sell will be diminished. While we will be subject to certain federal taxes on a small portion of our existing health business going forward, we dont expect the amount of these taxes to be material.  

The UA Independent Agency is Torchmarks largest in terms of health premium income, producing 35% of health premium in 2014. This Agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose sizes range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies. Torchmark had 3,161 active producing agents at December 31, 2014 compared with 2,414 a year earlier. This Agency is our largest producer of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $286 million or 68% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2014. Net sales for this Agency were $84 million in 2014, consisting almost entirely of Medicare Supplement business. These net sales were more than double the net sales of $41 million in 2013. In 2013, they had declined 2%. Total health premium income for the UA Independent Agency was $305 million in 2014, an increase of 2% from $298 million in 2013. Premium income had declined very slightly in 2013.  

The Family Heritage Exclusive Agency was acquired by Torchmarks acquisition of Family Heritage on November 1, 2012 as discussed in Note 6Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This agency markets primarily limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return-of-premium, whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. The Family Heritage Agency is our largest agency in terms of limited-benefit health net sales, adding $47 million in net sales in 2014, compared with $44 million in 2013, an increase of 8%. This agencys $205 million in health premium income during 2014 represented 24% of Torchmarks total. Premium in 2014 increased 7% over 2013 premium of $191 million. The producing agent count was 785 agents at December 31, 2014, compared with 695 agents at December 31, 2013. The average agent count for 2014 was 740. The agent count was 702 at December 31, 2012. Management expects to grow this agency going forward through geographic expansion and incorporation of Torchmarks recruiting programs.  

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency represented 25% of all Torchmark health premium income at $222 million in 2014. The Liberty Agency markets limited-benefit health supplemental products consisting primarily of cancer insurance. Much of the Libertys health business is now generated through worksite marketing which targets small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. In 2014, health premium income in the Agency declined 8% from prior year premium of $241 million, after also declining 8% in 2013. These premium declines were due primarily to the runoff of a block of discontinued hospital-surgical business as well as an earlier restructuring of this Agency to a variable-cost, commission-driven model. The Liberty Agency experienced growth in net health sales in 2014 of 22% to $17 million. The agent count at Liberty was 1,498 at 2014 year end, an increase of 5% over year end 2013 and 6% over year end 2012.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency, predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, was our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium income in 2014. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans. Approximately 68% of the agencys 2014 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the plans by this Agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.  

Health premium at this agency was $79 million in both 2014 and 2013. In 2013, it had declined slightly from $80 million. However, health net sales rose 31% in 2014 to $9 million, after falling 20% in 2013 to $7 million. Because this agency focuses on life products, health net sales comprised only 5% of the American Income Agencys total net sales in 2014.

Direct Response, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups. In 2014, net health sales were $23 million, compared with $4 million in 2013 and $5 million in 2012. The large increase in Direct Response net sales in 2014 was due to the addition of a large Medicare Supplement group, which is not indicative of a trend. In 2014, health net sales for this group represented approximately 13% of Direct Responses total life and health net sales. Direct Response health premium income was $59 million in 2014, increasing 9% over 2013 premium of $54 million. Health premium declined 7% in 2013.  

As presented in the following table, Torchmarks health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 1% to $199 million in 2014, after an increase of 20% to $197 million in 2013. Family Heritage contributed $32 million of the $33 million 2013 increase. As a percentage of premium income, margins were 23% in both 2014 and 2013 as compared with 22% in 2012.

Medicare Part D. Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, offers coverage under the governments Medicare Part D plan. The Medicare Part D plan is a stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by CMS for participating private insurers like United American. Under Part D, private carriers are the primary insurers, while CMS provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance. Our Medicare Part D product is sold through the Direct Response operation and to groups through the UA Independent Agency.  

Medicare Part D  

Selected Financial Information  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Total Medicare Part D premium excludes $25.5 million and $2.6 million of risk-sharing premium received in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $404 thousand in 2012 of risk-sharing premium paid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services consistent with the Medicare Part D contract. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.  

 (2)   Net sales for Medicare Part D represents only new first-time enrollees.  

 (3)   First-year collected premium for Medicare Part D represents only premium collected within the first twelve months from new first-time enrollees.  

Total Medicare Part D premium was $348 million in 2014, compared with $300 million in 2013 and $318 million in 2012. Part D net sales were $186 million in 2014, compared with $79 million in 2013 and $114 million in 2012. The unusual increase in 2014 net sales was due to the addition in 2014 of the auto-enrollees as noted below. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales, and the majority of premium income is from previous enrollees. Total enrollees in the program were 269 thousand at the beginning of the 2014 plan year, 254 thousand at the beginning of the 2013 plan year, and 215 thousand at the beginning of the 2012 plan year.  

Changes in Part D premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees, which are heavily influenced by new sales. In 2012, the Company issued a new lower cost Part D plan allowing us to pick up a large number of auto-enrollees in 21 regions with resulting higher sales. In 2013, due to intensified price competition, we qualified for new low-income auto-enrollees in only 7 regions but were able to keep prior year auto-enrollees in 14 regions and maintain our presence in 21 regions. In 2014, Torchmark qualified to receive new Part D auto-enrollees in 15 regions and also qualified to retain prior year auto-enrollees in 8 regions, for a total of 23 regions. These variations in the number of new auto-enrollees caused the changes in Part D net sales, premium, and enrollee counts, including the large increases in 2014 and the declines in 2013. The 2013 decline was also influenced by the loss of several employer group Part D cases at the end of 2012.  

As presented in the following table, margins decreased 23% in 2014 to $27 million, even though premium rose 16%. Premiums were increased for the year 2014 to cover higher anticipated non-deferred acquisition expenses. As such, we expected significantly lower obligation ratios in 2014. However, due primarily to unexpected costs related to two Hepatitis C drugs, the coverage of which was mandated by CMS Administration early in 2014, well after our 2014 pricing was finalized, the obligation ratios for 2014 increased from 82% to 83%. Non-deferred acquisition cost ratios were significantly higher, as planned in our pricing, due to (1) new taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act, (2) higher costs related to a change in the structure of drug rebates, and (3) higher costs related to the increased volume of enrollees. As a percentage of premium, underwriting margin for 2014 fell to 8%, compared with 12% for 2013. In 2013, margins increased 6% to $35 million, even though premium declined 6%. As a percentage of premium, margins rose from 10% to 12%. The benefit ratio declined 2%, as a result of lower claims experience in the group market in 2013. Group Part D claims tend to fluctuate from year to year.

 (1)   Total Medicare Part D premium excludes $25.5 million and $2.6 million of risk-sharing premium received in 2014 and 2013 respectively, and $404 thousand in 2012 of risk sharing premium paid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services consistent with the Medicare Part D contract. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.  

For 2015, we do not expect Hepatitis C claims to have the same negative impact on margins that they had in 2014, as our 2015 pricing reflects the cost of these drugs. In addition, we will have significantly less auto-enrollees in 2015. Auto-enrollees accounted for approximately 85% of our 2014 Hepatitis C claims.  

Total enrollees in the program were 249 thousand at the beginning of the 2015 plan year, compared with 269 thousand in 2014. We expect that Part D margins will be flat to slightly lower in 2015, based on a preliminary analysis of the risk scores and claims history of our 2015 enrollees.  

We participate in the Medicare Part D program because it complements our Medicare Supplement products, it provides us with incremental income, we have extensive experience with the senior-age market, and the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for participating insurers limit our risk. Additionally, due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, as with any government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.  

Annuities. Our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $1.36 billion, $1.38 billion, and $1.35 billion, respectively. Underwriting income was $4.3 million, $3.9 million, and $3.5 million in each of the respective years.  

While the fixed annuity account balance has remained relatively stable each year over the prior year, underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year. Policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year. The majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are not based on account size. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. In the three-year period, however, spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums.  

We do not currently market annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and health insurance products. Therefore, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.

Administrative expenses. Operating expenses are included in the Other and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2014.  

Operating Expenses Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Insurance administrative expenses rose 1% in 2014, after having increased 8% in 2013. As a percentage of premium, they increased .1% in 2013 to 5.9%, but declined .3% in 2014 to 5.6%. The inclusion of Family Heritages administrative expenses accounted for $8.1 million of the $13.5 million increase in total administrative expense in 2013. Non-salary employee costs increased 19% in 2013 but fell back 16% in 2014, close to 2012 levels. These fluctuations were caused in large part by adjustments to pension expenses primarily due to changes in interest rates in the financial markets. Stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of Torchmark stock has increased, resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options, as well as positive Company performance that caused an increase in the expense related to performance share grants. As stated in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense.  

As described in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we described certain litigation matters that were incurred in the years 2014 and 2013 that were not directly related to our ongoing core insurance operations. Management does not consider these litigation matters to be part of insurance administration expense, but instead considers them to be non-operating expenses. Also during 2013, Torchmark recorded an additional non-operating charge involving a state guaranty fund assessment in the amount of $1.2 million, resulting from events in years prior to 2012. We incurred expenses of $2.9 million related to the acquisition of Family Heritage in late 2012 as described in Note 6Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. While all of these non-operating expenses were included in Operating expenses for the respective year in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance with accounting guidance, they are removed by management from consideration when evaluating segment operating results.

Investments. We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs. We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $6.1 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.  

Excess Investment Income. The following table summarizes Torchmarks investment income and excess investment income.

Excess investment income increased $6 million or 3% in 2014 over the prior year. Excess investment income declined $18 million or 8% in 2013. Excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption. On a per diluted share basis, excess investment income increased 8% to $1.70 in 2014. Excess investment income declined 2% to $1.57 per share in 2013, after having risen 3% in the prior year. The greater increase in 2014 per-share amounts, as well as the smaller decline in 2013 relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share repurchases.  

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, as adjusted for the segment analysis, which rose 3% to $758 million in 2014. It increased 3% to $735 million in 2013 from $716 million in 2012. The inclusion of Family Heritage, acquired in late 2012, added $21 million of net investment income in 2013 compared with $3 million in 2012, accounting for the majority of the 2013 increase. However, growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment. In 2014, fixed maturity yields averaged 5.91% on a tax-equivalent and effective-yield basis, compared with 5.94% in 2013 and 6.35% in 2012. Even though mean invested assets have increased each period, net investment income has grown at a slower pace as a result of the decline in average yields. In a declining rate environment, the overall portfolio yield will decrease as new money is invested at lower prevailing yields. The reduction in the average yields has primarily been the result of reinvesting proceeds from bonds that matured or were called at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they matured or were called. While Family Heritage added incrementally to net investment income during 2014 and 2013, its lower-yielding portfolio has also contributed to the decline in the average fixed-maturity yield.  

A major factor negatively affecting net investment income, especially in 2012 and 2013, was calls of fixed-maturity securities. During 2012, and to a lesser extent in 2013, we had an unusually large number of these calls, including $339 million of bank-issued hybrid securities in 2012 and $129 million in 2013. Fixed maturity securities are more likely to be called in a declining interest-rate environment, as these callable securities can often be refinanced at lower prevailing rates. In 2014, however, call activity has been more limited. We believe that it is unlikely that calls would have a material negative impact on investment income in the foreseeable future if our callable investments were called and the proceeds from those calls were reinvested at expected future new money rates. During 2014, the proceeds from all dispositions have been reinvested at yield rates closer to the yield rates on the disposed assets.  

Net investment income has also been negatively affected in 2014 by the CMS requirement for us to pay certain Medicare Part D claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government, but are not reimbursed until the following year. Because Part D claims have been unusually high in 2014, due to the approval of new Hepatitis C drugs discussed earlier in this report and higher overall drug costs, we have incurred extensive upfront costs that will not be reimbursed by CMS until late 2015. This delay in reimbursement has caused a delay in cash flows available for new investments that resulted in a loss of approximately $5 million of pre-tax net investment income in 2014, and will cause us to lose approximately $4 million of additional investment income in 2015. Please refer to Note 10¯Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

While net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above, we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years compared with the larger declines in recent years. We anticipate that less than 2% of fixed maturities  

34  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years. Overall, we are encouraged that the prospect of additional significant calls seems to be behind us and expected maturities should have lower yields than in the past.  

Excess investment income is reduced by the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities because we consider these amounts to be components of the profitability of our insurance segments. Required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. The great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products (formerly SFAS 60, now incorporated into ASC 944-20-05). This guidance mandates that interest rate assumptions be locked in for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the assumed discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. That rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on the premiums received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed except in the event of a premium deficiency. The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. As such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the in force business by issue year.  

Because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. Due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted-average discount rate of our in force block, we dont expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.  

Information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table.

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income.  

The table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Analysis of Financing Costs  

(Amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) See Principles of Consolidation in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of deconsolidation.  

Financing costs decreased $4 million or 5% in 2014. They were essentially flat in 2013. The decrease in financing costs in 2014 was due to the maturity and repayment of our $94 million par amount $7.375% Notes during the third quarter of 2013. The increase in financing costs in 2013 reflects the increased interest expense from the issuance in September, 2012 of $300 million principal amount of our 3.8% Senior Notes due in 2022, $150 million of which is eliminated in consolidation. Also in September, 2012, we issued our 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2052 for $125 million principal amount but called our $120 million 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities one month later. In both 2014 and 2013, interest on short-term debt declined primarily because of the reduction in the weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt. More information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the Financial Condition section of this report and in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

As previously noted, growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs, such as we have experienced in recent periods. In an extended low-interest-rate environment, the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long-term rates. We believe, however, the decline would be relatively slow, as, on average, only 1% to 2% of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years.  

In response to the lower interest rates, we raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in early 2012 and again in late 2013. The increased premium provides additional margin on these policies to help offset higher mandatory cash values and the possible future reductions in excess investment income. Despite these increases in premium rates, we have continued to see growth in net sales.  

Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates. Therefore, Torchmark would benefit if rates, especially long-term rates, were to rise.

Investment Acquisitions. Torchmarks current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities (maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. Further, we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, we consider investing in short-term securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time. During calendar years 2012 through 2014, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, primarily with longer-term maturities as presented in the chart below.  

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the worst call date. Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date.  

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. However, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.  

During the three years 2012 through 2014, we have invested almost entirely in investment-grade corporate bonds. Acquisitions in all three years have been primarily in industrial and utility bonds. New cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations, but has also been affected by other factors. Issuer calls, as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor, especially in 2012. Calls increase funds available for investment, but as noted earlier in this discussion, they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $160 million in 2014, $344 million in 2013, and $650 million in 2012. The higher level of acquisitions in 2012 was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2012 calls.

Portfolio Analysis. Because Torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmarks components of invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2014 with the latest industry data.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2014, fixed maturities had a fair value of $14.5 billion, compared with $12.9 billion at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, fixed maturities were in a $1.7 billion net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of $390 million at December 31, 2013. Approximately 82% of our fixed maturity assets at December 31, 2014 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 4% were redeemable preferred stocks. This compares with 81% corporate bonds and 4% redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2013. On a combined basis, residential mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were 1% of the assets at amortized cost at December 31, 2014. The $68 million of CDOs at amortized cost made up less than 0.6% of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. The $6 million of residential mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA. For more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2014 and 2013, including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products, Torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery. Even though these fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale, Torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired.  

Additional information concerning the fixed-maturity portfolio is as follows.

Credit Risk Sensitivity. Credit risk relates to the level of uncertainty that a securitys issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 87% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, we continually monitor credit risk. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring only investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by spreading investments over a large number of issuers and a wide range of industry sectors.  

The following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2014.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2014, approximately 24% of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost (25% at fair value) were in the financial sector, including 14% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 5% in banks. Financial guarantors, mortgage insurers, and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5% of the portfolio at amortized cost. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 17% of the portfolio at amortized cost. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 396 issuers in a wide variety of sectors.  

Our energy sector investments accounted for 12% of fixed maturities at amortized cost as of December 31, 2014. While this sector has seen recent volatility, we believe the risk of losses in the foreseeable future is minimal. Over 98% of these holdings are investment grade, and the portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $151 million at year end 2014. Less than 8% of our holdings are in the oil field service and drilling area. While there may be some downgrades in this sector, we believe that our investments will be able to withstand lower energy prices for an extended duration.

An analysis of the fixed-maturity portfolio by a composite rating at December 31, 2014 is shown in the table below. The composite rating for each security, other than private-placement securities managed by a third party, is the average of the securitys ratings as assigned by Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. Included in the chart below are private placement fixed-maturity holdings of $497 million at amortized cost ($513 million at fair value) for which the ratings were assigned by the third-party manager.  

Fixed Maturities by Rating  

At December 31, 2014  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of A- based on amortized cost. Approximately 96% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other than $9 million of German government bonds at amortized cost and fair value, we have no direct exposure to European sovereign debt.  

Our current investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.  

An analysis of changes in below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows.

Market Risk Sensitivity. Torchmarks financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the companys investment portfolio. Since 96% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and generally the intent to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, as is permitted by GAAP, these liabilities are not recorded at fair value.  

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2014 and 2013. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.  

Investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.  

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.  

The following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014.

   **   Written down due to other-than-temporary impairment.  

As described in Note 4Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we wrote certain securities down to fair value during 2012 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and in our Critical Accounting Policies in this report. The writedowns resulted in pretax charges of $5.6 million in 2012 ($3.6 million after tax). During 2013, we sold investment real estate for an after-tax loss of $1.9 million, of which $1.7 million had been written down due to other-than-temporary impairment earlier in the year. In 2012, we redeemed our 7.1% Trust Originated Preferred Securities, recording a loss on redemption of $4.1 million ($2.7 million after tax).

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Liquidity. Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.  

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity. The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. While the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income.  

Parent Company Liquidity. Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, operating expenses of the Parent, and Parent Company dividends to Torchmark shareholders. In 2014, the Parent received $479 million of cash dividends from its insurance subsidiaries, compared with $488 million in 2013 and $437 million in 2012. Including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2014 of approximately $377 million, compared with $364 million in 2013. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2015, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive approximately $473 million in dividends from subsidiaries, and that an approximate range of $355 to $365 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of Note 12Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company. As additional liquidity, the Parent held $6 million of cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2014, compared with $8 million a year earlier. The Parent also had available a $50 million receivable from subsidiaries at 2014 year end.  

Short-Term Borrowings. An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million. In July 2014, Torchmark replaced a $600 million facility with this new agreement, as discussed in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under the caption Commercial Paper. The new facility, like the previous, is further designated as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2014, we had available $314 million of additional borrowing capacity under this new facility, compared with $173 million a year earlier. There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended December 31, 2014. For detailed information about this new line of credit facility, please refer to Note 11Debt.  

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2015 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, a short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.  

Consolidated Liquidity. Consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $865 million in 2014, compared with $1.1 billion in 2013 and $943 million in 2012. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies have received $160 million in investment calls and tenders and $113 million  

44  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2014. Maturities, tenders, and calls totaled $494 million in 2013 and $737 million in 2012.  

Our cash and short-term investments were $82 million at year-end 2014 and $114 million at year-end 2013. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $14.5 billion at December 31, 2014. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As a part of its above-mentioned credit facility, Torchmark had outstanding $198 million in stand-by letters of credit at December 31, 2014. However, these letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. Any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require Torchmark to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs.  

As of December 31, 2014, we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities. All of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 15Commitments and Contingencies.  

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of December 31, 2014.

 (2)   Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (4)   Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at December 31, 2014. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources. Torchmarks capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), long-term funded debt, and shareholders equity. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in Note 11.  

The carrying value of the long-term funded debt was $992 million at December 31, 2014, compared with $991 million a year earlier. As fully explained in Note 11Debt, we issued $300 million principal amount of 3.8% Senior Notes due in 2022 in September, 2012 for proceeds of $297 million in a public offering. However, $150 million of the offering was acquired by Torchmark insurance subsidiaries and was eliminated in consolidation, resulting in net proceeds after issue expenses to the consolidated group of $147 million. The majority of the $297 million proceeds received by the Parent were used to acquire Family Heritage as described in Note 6Acquisition. The balance was invested and later used for the redemption of our $94.5 million principal amount 7 3/8% Notes that matured on August 1, 2013 and for other corporate purposes. The principal balance of the 7 3/8% Notes, along with accrued interest, was then repaid on its maturity date in the total amount of $97.5 million.  

As also discussed in Note 11, we issued $125 million principal amount of our 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2052 in a September, 2012 public offering. This issue resulted in net proceeds after issue expenses of $121 million, and were used to redeem our 7.1% Trust Originated Preferred Securities in the amount of $120 million plus accrued dividends for a total cost of $121 million.  

Also noted in Note 11 was our assumption of $20 million of Trust Preferred Securities in connection with our acquisition of Family Heritage. These securities bear interest at a variable rate, the three-month LIBOR plus 330 basis points, which is reset each quarter. While these securities are callable by us at any time, we have no immediate plans to do so.  

Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325% of required regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. At December 31, 2014, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios of approximately 326%. Should we experience additional impairments and/or ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325%, management has more than sufficient liquidity at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325%.  

As noted under the caption Summary of Operations in this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program. Under this program, we acquired 7 million shares at a cost of $375 million in 2014, 8 million shares at a cost of $360 million in 2013, and 11 million shares for $360 million in 2012. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption Summary of Operations in this report.  

Torchmark has increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years. In the first quarter of 2012, it was increased to $.10 per share from $.08 per share. In the first quarter of 2013, it was again raised to $.1133 per share. Then, in the first quarter of 2014, dividends were raised to $.1267 per share.  

Shareholders equity was $4.7 billion at December 31, 2014, compared with $3.8 billion at December 31, 2013. During the twelve months since December 31, 2013, shareholders equity was reduced by the $375 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another $74 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises. However, it was increased by $827 million of after-tax unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio and by the $543 million of net income.  

We plan to use excess cash available at the Parent Company as efficiently as possible in the future. Possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. From time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.  

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmarks capital structure.

 (4)   Torchmarks debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders equity.  

FASB guidance provides for an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because  

47  

Table of Contents

 both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we have not elected this option.  

Torchmarks ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 11.2 times in 2014, compared with 10.5 times in 2013 and 2012. This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption Investments in this report.  

Financial Strength Ratings. The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poors and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2014.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. Companies rated A (Excellent) are considered to have excellent ability to meet those obligations.  

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P) to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. An insurer rated A has strong financial security characteristics, but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings. The plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.  

In August 2014, S&P updated its outlook on Torchmarks capital position to a negative outlook. The revised outlook was due to a change in S&Ps view of certain internal components of Torchmarks existing capital position rather than a change in the capital position itself. Management believes Torchmarks regulatory capital position is currently as strong as it has been for many years and we expect our consolidated RBC ratio to remain at least 325% going forward. While we are currently evaluating multiple options to address S&Ps comments, we do not anticipate any change in our share repurchase program as a result of S&Ps action.  

OTHER ITEMS  

Litigation. Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since Torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to Note 15Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Future Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Approximately 84% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2014 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Future Policy Benefits. Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. Torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended December 31, 2014.  

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.  

Deferred Acquisition Costs. Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Deferred Acquisition Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance purchased, is included in deferred acquisition costs. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in Note 1.  

Approximately 99% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2014 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked-in at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2014.  

The remaining 1% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2014.  

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable. This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate  

49  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.  

Valuation of Fixed Maturities. We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption Market Risk Sensitivity in this report. However, as discussed under the caption Financial Condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.  

At times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and in Note 4Investments under the captions Fair Value Measurements in both notes.  

Impairment of Investments. We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussions under the captions Investments and Realized Gains and Losses in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.  

Defined benefit pension plans. We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2014, our gross liability under these funded plans was $403 million, but was offset by assets of $323 million.  

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. For example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the

 discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2014 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   The discount rate was 5.12% for 2014 expense and 4.23% for the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2014  

   (2)   The expected return rate assumed was 6.97%  

The Company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broad-based studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales. During 2014, the Company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the Society of Actuaries. The change in these assumptions added approximately $26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014.  

The criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in Note 9Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. Note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.

Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to:  

1) Changes in lapse rates and/or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions;  

2) Federal and state legislative and regulatory developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal Medicare program that would affect Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance;  

3) Market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare Supplement insurance;  

4) Interest rate changes that affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield;  

5) General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities that we own, or that may impair issuers ability to pay interest due us on those securities;  

6) Changes in pricing competition;  

7) Litigation results;  

8) Levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from our assumptions;  

9) Our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;
