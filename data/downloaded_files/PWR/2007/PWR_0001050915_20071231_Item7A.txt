ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

 We are exposed to market risks, primarily related to increases in fuel prices and adverse changes in interest rates, as discussed below. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain transactions may not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. We are currently not exposed to any significant market risks or interest rate risk from the use of derivatives. See Currency Risk below for a discussion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk from the use of derivatives.  

 Interest Rate. Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our convertible subordinated notes. The fair market value of our fixed rate convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of our convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price falls. The interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes but do not impact their carrying value. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt of $447.0 million and $413.8 million was approximately $692.2 million and $825.6 million, based upon market prices on or before such date.  

 Currency Risk. The business of our Canadian subsidiaries is subject to currency fluctuations. We do not expect any such currency risk to be material.
