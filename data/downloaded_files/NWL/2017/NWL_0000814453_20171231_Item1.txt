GENERAL  

Newell Brands is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people make life better every day, where they live, learn, work and play. Our products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands, including Paper Mate®, Sharpie®, Dymo®, EXPO®, Parker®, Elmers®, Coleman®, Jostens®, Marmot®, Rawlings®, Oster®, Sunbeam®, FoodSaver®, Mr. Coffee®, Rubbermaid Commercial Products®, Graco®, Baby Jogger®, NUK®, Calphalon®, Rubbermaid®, Contigo®, First Alert®, Waddington and Yankee Candle®. The Company sells its products in nearly 200 countries around the world and has operations on the ground in nearly 100 of these countries.  

During 2017, the Company continued to execute the Growth Game Plan, the multi-year strategy that was updated in late 2016 for the new broader portfolio. The Growth Game Plan enables the simplification of the organization and frees up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Companys brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a more profitable and cash flow generative company, with global reach.  

As part of the Growth Game Plan, the Company has transformed from a holding company to an operating company, consolidating its 32 business units into 16 global divisions while investing to extend its design, innovation, brand development and E-commerce capabilities across a broader set of categories. The new global divisions are the key commercial nodes in the Company, including a Global E-commerce division with responsibility for all E-commerce activity across the enterprise. The divisions generally align to the four areas of strategic focus for the Company of Live, Learn, Work, and Play. The new structure became effective January 1, 2017.  

During 2017, the Company acquired Smith Mountain, a leading provider of premium home fragrance products, sold primarily under the WoodWick® Candle brand; Sistema Plastics, a leading provider of food storage and beverage containers in Australia, New Zealand, U.K, and parts of Europe; and Chesapeake Bay Candle, a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of premium candles and other home fragrance products, focused on consumer wellness and natural fragrance.  

During 2016, the Company committed to plans to divest several other businesses and brands to strengthen the portfolio to better align and focus the portfolio for growth and margin development. To that end, during 2017 the Company sold its Tools business, its Rubbermaid® consumer storage totes business, its stroller business under the Teutonia® brand, its Lehigh business, its firebuilding business, its triathlon apparel business under the Zoot® and Squadra® brands and its Winter Sports business.  

In January 2018, Newell Brands announced that it will explore a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate its transformation plan, improve operational performance, reduce debt and leverage and enhance shareholder value. The Company is planning on focusing its portfolio on core consumer divisions. The Company is exploring strategic options for industrial and commercial product assets, including Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa, as well as several smaller consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards. The accelerated transformation plan would significantly reduce operational and systems complexity, exposure to economic cycles and resin commodities and focus the Companys remaining portfolio on leading brands in global consumer-facing categories that can leverage Newell Brands advantaged capabilities in brands, innovation, design and E-commerce.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES  

Newell Brands is committed to building leading brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer superior performance and value. The Company intends to continue to leverage its portfolio of leading brands to create a margin structure that allows for further increases in brand investment.  

During 2016, the Company launched the Growth Game Plan, which is its strategy to simplify the organization and free up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Companys brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more profitable company.  

The Growth Game Plan encompasses the following strategic elements:  

The Newell Brands Vision  

The Newell Brands vision for the Company is grounded in three core characteristics of the business: its geographic reach with sales in nearly 200 countries and territories, its presence in a broad set of large growing household product categories, and its portfolio of leading brands that make a difference in the lives of consumers every day. The Company asserts that it impacts lives through the broad geographic reach of its business system, through its category presence and leading brands that touch consumers at home, in school, at work, and where they play. The Companys vision is that Newell Brands makes life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play.  

The Newell Brands DNA and Ambition  

The Newell Brands DNA represents an aspirational set of behaviors that define the culture the company aspires to create. The Newell Brands DNA and Ambition serve as a call to action for the Companys employees, challenging them to grow, transform, lead, and win. The Company captures our ambition with our employees as follows:  

We believe growth and scale benefits drive value creation and we achieve our potential by putting the consumer first in everything that we do. Our portfolio is a powerful collection of leading brands in large, growing, unconsolidated global categories. Over time we are choice-fully building a more international business that reaches the consumer wherever they want to buy our brands. Our strategy is designed to achieve meaningful relative market share advantage in our core categories. We will win by combining Brand Development (insights, product design, innovation, brand communication) with Every Day Great Execution, partnering with our customers to build our categories and maximize reach, availability, and visibility. We are a transformative company in the stretching ambitions we pursue. The clarity of our strategy and the decisive way that we put our choices into action is a distinctive characteristic of our leaders. Money flows to growth and we are true to our entrepreneurial roots by focusing on impact in the market place. This process creates growth missions for our empowered teams. We build our people as we build new business. We expect our people and our ideas to be judged as leaders in our business community. Our brands are better together. We win by acting as one operating company that has the scale and capabilities to outgrow, out execute, and out spend our competition. Our strong financial foundation of cash generation creates a platform for scaling this model through strategic M&A in our core categories.

Raw Materials and Sourced Finished Goods  

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. The Companys product offerings require the purchase of resin, corrugate, glass, plastic, expanded polystyrene, extinguisher powder, nylon, paper, plastic resin, sawdust, tin plate, wax and wood, natural rubber, electrical components, glass fiber, magnesium, adhesives, various paper-related packaging materials and metals, including steel, stainless steel, aluminum copper and gold. The Companys resin purchases principally comprise polyethylene, polypropylene and copolyester.  

The Company also relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. Historically, the Company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs. For a limited number of product lines, a single manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line. In particular, certain businesses within the Companys Live segment rely on third-party manufacturers for substantially all of their products. Specifically, the Baby division has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products.  

See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.  

Backlog  

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.  

Seasonal Variations  

Sales of the Companys products tend to be seasonal, with sales, operating income and operating cash flow in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter. The seasonality of the Companys sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs, such as depreciation, amortization, rent, personnel costs and interest expense, impacts the Companys results on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, customer program payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers.  

Patents and Trademarks  

The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to its business. The Companys most significant registered trademarks include Sharpie®, Paper Mate®, Elmers®, Parker®, Waterman®, Dymo®, Rubbermaid®, Contigo®, Goody®, Calphalon®, Graco®, Baby Jogger®, Aprica®, Bionaire®, Coleman®, Crock-Pot®, First Alert®, FoodSaver®, Health o Meter®, Marmot®, Mr. Coffee®, Oster®, Quickie®, Rawlings®, Rival®, Shakespeare®, Stearns®, Sistema®, Sunbeam® and Yankee Candle®.  

Customers/Competition  

The Companys principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, craft stores, direct-to-consumer channels, specialty retailers and wholesalers, commercial distributors, e-commerce companies and Yankee Candle retail stores. Additionally, we distribute our Jostens and Waddington products through the academic and achievement channel and foodservice channel, respectively. The dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers, together with consumer shopping patterns, contributes to a market environment in which dominant multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers. This environment may limit the Companys ability to recover cost increases through selling prices.  

Current trends among retailers and e-commerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong end-user brands, are for retailers and e-commerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label brands, which compete with the Companys products. The combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Companys principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well-established. Our Yankee Candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a variety of other retailers, including department stores, gift stores and national specialty retailers that carry candles.
