Our Strategy

Our strategy is to provide innovative products, services and solutions that drive scientific enhancements and productivity improvements in targeted high growth market segments and to develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further development and expansion of the markets we serve. To execute on our strategy and drive higher revenue growth, we focus on broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative technology and expenditures for research and development. Our strategy includes:

•Achieving significant growth in both of our core business segments, Human Health and Environmental Health, through strategic acquisitions and licensing;

•Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;

•Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;

•Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and

•Attracting, retaining and developing talented and engaged employees.

Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:

Strategic Business ReAlignment:

In January 2015, we approved and announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2015 that is designed to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and to develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets. As part of this realignment, our OneSource multivendor service offering business that serves the life sciences end market will be moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2015, we will report financial results under our Human Health and Environmental Health segments using this new alignment.

Acquisitions in Fiscal Year 2014:

Acquisition of Perten Instruments Group AB. In December 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Perten Instruments Group AB ("Perten"). Perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food, grain, flour and feed. We expect this acquisition to enhance our industrial, environmental and safety business by expanding our product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets. We paid the shareholders of Perten $269.9 million in cash for the stock of Perten. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date. 

Other acquisitions. In addition to the Perten acquisition, we completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2014 for total consideration of $18.0 million in cash and $4.3 million of assumed debt. We reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments from the acquisition dates.

Restructuring:

During fiscal year 2014, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $7.7 million in our Human Health segment and $6.7 million in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. Our management approved these plans principally to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives and to focus resources on higher growth end markets. We also recorded net pre-tax restructuring reversals of $0.8 million in our Human Health segment and $1.7 million in our Environmental Health segment related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions, which were partially offset by higher than expected costs for the closure of excess facility space. In addition during fiscal year 2014, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1.5 million in our Environmental Health segment primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments. This pre-tax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect no significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2014.

As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following actions:

Share Repurchase Program: 

On October 24, 2012, our Board of Directors (our "Board") authorized us to repurchase up to 6.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program expired on October 24, 2014. On October 23, 2014, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 8.0 million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 23, 2016 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $61.3 million, including commissions, under these repurchase programs. As of December 28, 2014, approximately 7.4 million shares authorized by our Board under the New Repurchase Program remained available for repurchase.

Discontinued Operations: 

In May 2014, our management approved the shutdown of our microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States, which had been reported within our Human Health segment. We determined that, with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers, the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market. The shutdown of the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States resulted in a $0.1 million net pre-tax loss primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets, which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014.

Business Segments and Products

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and Environmental Health. We performed our annual impairment testing on January 1, 2014, the annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value), we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.

Human Health Segment

Our Human Health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics, tools and applications to help detect diseases earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. Within our Human Health segment, we serve the diagnostics and research markets. Our Human Health segment generated revenue of $1,243.4 million in fiscal year 2014.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces. As of December 28, 2014, we employed approximately 3,600 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify 

9
alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were $121.1 million during fiscal year 2014, $132.4 million during fiscal year 2013, and $131.8 million during fiscal year 2012.

We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012 primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory service and support markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2015, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in 

10
connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $12.3 million and $13.5 million as of December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. These amounts are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. During fiscal year 2014, we recorded a benefit of $2.3 million for cost reimbursements related to a particular site, of which $1.2 million was for future monitoring and mitigation activities. During fiscal year 2013, we accrued an additional $5.7 million related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities, of which $4.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of December 28, 2014, we employed approximately 7,700 employees in our continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of December 28, 2014, we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,500 union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Business Segments

We have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year 2014, we had $1,387.9 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. During fiscal year 2014, we derived approximately 50% of our international sales from our Human Health segment and approximately 50% of our international sales from our Environmental Health segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
