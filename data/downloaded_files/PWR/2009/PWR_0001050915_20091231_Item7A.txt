ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    

 Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates.  

 Credit Risk. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss, the recent volatility in the financial markets is likely to continue to have a significant negative impact on the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally with collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our customersÂ’ ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the current financial crisis and volatility of the markets. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable is limited because of the diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and obtain collateral or other security from our customers when appropriate.  

 Interest Rate and Market Risk. Our exposure to interest rate and market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our convertible subordinated notes. The fair market value of our fixed rate convertible subordinated notes is subject to interest rate risk because of their fixed interest rate and market risk due to the convertible feature of our convertible subordinated notes. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes will also increase as the market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price falls. The interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes but do not impact their carrying value. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of our fixed-rate debt of $143.8 million was approximately $136.6 million and $160.8 million, based upon quoted secondary market prices on or before such dates. In addition, the volatility of the credit markets has had a negative impact on interest income in the last several quarters, and it is likely to significantly impact our interest income related to our cash investments in the near-term.  

 Currency Risk. In the third quarter of 2009, one of our Canadian operating units entered into three forward contracts with settlement dates in December 2009, June 2010 and November 2010, to reduce foreign currency risk associated with anticipated customer sales that are denominated in South African rand. This same operating unit also entered into three additional forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure associated with a series of forecasted intercompany payments denominated in U.S. dollars to be made in the next twelve months, which also had settlement dates in December 2009, June 2010 and November 2010.

 The South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of approximately $11.0 million ($CAD) at origination, with one contract for approximately $5.8 million ($CAD) being settled in December 2009. These contracts have been accounted for by the Canadian operating unit as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the three forward contracts between the South African rand and the Canadian dollar have been recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to their settlement and have been and will be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions occur. During the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $0.3 million of loss was reclassified into income in connection with the settled contract. During the year ended December 31, 2009, a gain of $0.1 million was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) related to the two remaining South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts.  

 The three Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of approximately $9.5 million (U.S.) at origination, with one contract for approximately $5.0 million having settled in December 2009. Such contracts have also been accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the three forward contracts between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar have been recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to their settlement and have been or will be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions occur. During the year ended December 31, 2009, a loss of $0.5 million was reclassified into earnings in connection with the settled contract and a loss of $0.5 million was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) related to the two remaining Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar forward contracts.
