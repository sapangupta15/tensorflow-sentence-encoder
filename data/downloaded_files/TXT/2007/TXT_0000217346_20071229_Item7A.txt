Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risks 

Our financial results are affected by changes in U.S. and foreign interest rates. As part of managing this risk, we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and vice versa. The overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating- and fixed-rate debt. We continually monitor our mix of floating- and fixed-rate debt and adjust the mix, as necessary, based on our evaluation of internal and external factors. The difference between the rates our Manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2007, 2006 or 2005. 

Our Finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating-rate assets with floating-rate liabilities. This strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements. At December 29, 2007, floating-rate liabilities in excess of floating-rate assets were $51 million, net of $2.3 billion of interest rate exchange agreements, which effectively converted fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate equivalent. Interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the net effect of increasing interest expense for our Finance group by $25 million in 2007 and $27 million in 2006, and decreasing interest expense by $11 million in 2005. 

Foreign Exchange Risks 

Our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and/or sold. For 2007, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2006 increased revenues by approximately $148 million (1.3%) and increased segment profit by approximately $12 million (0.9%). 

For our manufacturing operations, we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset. We primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and British pound sterling for these purposes. 

In managing its foreign currency transaction exposures, we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts. These contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of 2007 and $765 million at the end of 2006. 

Quantitative Risk Measures 

In the normal course of business, we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading. To quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis. The financial instruments that are subject to market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk) include finance receivables (excluding lease receivables), debt (excluding lease obligations), interest rate exchange agreements, foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts. 

Presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year-end. We estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers. This sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10% decrease in interest rates, a 10% strengthening in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and a 10% decrease in the quoted market price of the marketable equity security.
