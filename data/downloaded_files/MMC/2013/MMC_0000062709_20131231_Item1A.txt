Item 1A. Risk Factors 

You should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report. These risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY GENERALLY

Legal and Regulatory Issues

We are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims.

Our operating companies provide numerous professional services, including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting, actuarial and other services for corporate and public clients around the world. As a result of these activities, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions, or “E&O” claims. In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients. In our Consulting segment, such claims include allegations of damages arising from our actuarial, consulting, investments, pension administration and other services, which frequently involve (1) assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events, (2) drafting and interpretation of complex documentation governing pension plans, (3) calculating benefits within complicated pension structures and (4) the provision of investment advice and management of client assets. Given the long-tail nature of professional liability claims, E&O matters often relate to services provided by the Company dating back many years. E&O claims may seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant and subject us to liability for 

11

monetary damages, negative publicity, and reputational harm and divert personnel and management resources. The Company has varying levels of third-party insurance coverage, with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year.

In establishing liabilities for E&O claims in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No. 450-20 (Contingencies-Loss Contingencies), the Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses. A liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period.

Further, as more fully described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report, we are subject to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than E&O claims which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments, regulatory agencies such as the SEC in the United States and the FCA in the United Kingdom, and self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA, as further described above under Part I, Item 1 - Business (Regulation) of this report. The foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance, limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. These laws and regulations include trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., as well as import and export restrictions.

We are subject to additional federal, state and other rules and regulations, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations, among others, may be costly and adversely affect our business.

While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships.

In most jurisdictions, government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations, and have discretion to grant, renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities. Such authorities may require the Company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. In some areas of our businesses, we act on the basis of our own or the industry's interpretations of applicable laws or regulations, which may conflict from 

12

state to state or country to country. In the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities, we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities. Moreover, the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate, which could increase the likelihood of our businesses being non-compliant in one or more jurisdictions. 

The method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions. The vast majority of the compensation that Marsh receives is in the form of retail commissions and fees. The amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies, separate from retail commissions and fees, has increased substantially in the last several years. This compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers (including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions in parts of our operations. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams. In addition, these revenues present potential regulatory, litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust, competition and other laws. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client, insurer or other relationships.

Finally, government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, whether due to human error, misuse of information by employees or vendors, or as a result of cyberattacks, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.

We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients. This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information. In many jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and the European Union, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors. 

Data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. There is a growing body of international data protection laws, which, in part, includes security breach notification obligations, more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, legislators in the U.S. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the world would add to our IT and compliance costs. Our failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, as well as the general risks described herein relating to our compliance systems and controls.

We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. In addition, significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.

13

With respect to our commercial arrangements with third-party vendors, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems.

We have experienced data incidents, including breaches, resulting from human error as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our business or operations. In the future, the cost associated with human error, the misuse of information by employees or vendors, or a major cyberattack related to our systems (including costs relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services) could be substantial. Furthermore, the use of mobile technologies and social media by employees and third parties, and the speed at which information can be widely distributed, increases the risks associated with the intentional or unintentional distribution of confidential, personal or proprietary information. Improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts, as well as laws and regulations, resulting in increased legal and other costs, disruption of our operations and loss of revenue.

Financial Risks

Our pension obligations may cause the Company's earnings and cash flows to fluctuate.

The Company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees, totaling approximately $13.5 billion and related plan assets of approximately $13.6 billion at December 31, 2013. The Company's policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by U.S. law and the laws of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company offers defined benefit plans. In the U.S., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on ERISA guidelines. Contribution rates for non-U.S. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP. In the U.K., for example, contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the Company and the plans' trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans.  This process is governed by U.K. pension regulations. The assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for U.S. GAAP and currently result in a lower funded status than under U.S. GAAP.

During 2013, the Company contributed $26 million to its U.S. pension plans and $620 million to non-U.S. pension plans. As more fully described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, funding amounts will be impacted by future asset performance, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. In accordance with ASC Topic No. 715, the Company reflects the over- or under-funded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities, respectively. Given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans, variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our equity from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans, particularly in the U.K. 

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity.

Global economic and political conditions affect our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. These economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Should it become necessary for us to restructure our business, including reducing our work force, as a result of market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services, our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected.

14

Financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations and investing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions).

Our cash investments, including those held in a fiduciary capacity, are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the difficulties faced by financial institution counterparties. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets deteriorate, the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.

Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

We are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies, and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our U.S. operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in U.S. dollars. In certain jurisdictions, however, our Risk and Insurance Services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency. Due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations. Exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results.

During times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors. In addition, we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments, and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

The Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the Company, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock.

Further, the Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. 

Funds from the Company's operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are regularly repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange rates and tax-related costs.

In the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate.

Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk.

Currently, the Company's senior debt is rated Baa2 by Moody's and A- by S&P. The rating from S&P carries a Stable outlook, while the rating from Moody’s carries a Positive outlook.

If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources. Further, we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investment-

15

grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.

Our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly.

Quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors. These include:

•the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;

•the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress;

•fluctuations in hiring and utilization rates and clients' ability to terminate engagements without penalty;

•seasonality due to the impact of regulatory deadlines, policy renewals and other timing factors to which our clients are subject;

•the success of our acquisitions or investments;

•macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and global securities markets, particularly in the case of Mercer, where fees in certain business lines are derived from the value of assets under management or administration; and

•general economic conditions, since results of operations are directly affected by the levels of business activity of our clients, which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve.

A significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term. Therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses.

If we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for our work performed. Accounts receivable typically total about one-quarter of our total annual revenues. In most cases, we bill and collect on relatively short cycles. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients, which could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of, or be unable to collect, our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.

Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the Euro could adversely affect the Company's operating results as well as the value of the Company's Euro-denominated assets.

Concerns persist regarding the ability of certain Eurozone countries to service their debt obligations. As a result, a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions, such as cutting spending and raising taxes, designed to ease their future debt burdens. A potential consequence may be stagnant growth, or even recession, in the Eurozone economies and beyond. Any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the Eurozone economies, adversely affecting our operating results in the region. The Company may also face increased credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations. Finally, the value of the Company's assets held in the Eurozone, including cash holdings, will decline if the currency devalues.

16

Global Operations

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

We do business worldwide. In 2013, 55% of the Company's total revenue was generated from operations outside the United States, and over one-half of our employees are located outside the United States. We expect to expand our non-U.S. operations further.

The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:

•economic and political conditions in foreign countries;

•unexpected increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws; 

•withholding or other taxes that foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

•potential transfer pricing-related tax exposures that may result from the allocation of U.S.-based costs that benefit our non-U.S. businesses;

•potential conflicts of interest that may arise as we expand the scope of our businesses and our client base;

•international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions;

•local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;

•potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law; 

•potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, as well as import and export restrictions;

•limitations or restrictions that foreign or U.S. legislative bodies or regulators may impose on the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services;

•limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries;

•the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, particularly in light of the increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject;

•engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company; and

•potential difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems would provide us with an important advantage. Nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.

Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.

17

We regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.

Competitive Risks

Each of the Company's businesses operates in a highly competitive environment. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and results of operations will suffer.

As a global professional services firm, the Company faces acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors, including our geographic reach, the sophistication and quality of our services, our pricing relative to competitors and our customers' option to self-insure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants. If we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face, our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer. 

In addition, given the global breadth of the Company's operations, the Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the United States. Funds from the Company's operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are regularly repatriated to the United States out of annual earnings to pay dividends to stockholders, fund share repurchases and for other corporate purposes. The Company's consolidated tax rate is higher than a number of its key competitors that are domiciled outside the United States where corporate tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with a number of our peers.

In our Risk and Insurance Services segment, in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance, we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global, regional, national or local scale for both client business and employee talent. We compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries, and with various other companies that provide risk-related services. This competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services, whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client's account.

In our Consulting segment, we compete for business and employee talent with numerous consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world. Through these affiliations, such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive coverage to potential clients. 

The loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business.

Across all of our businesses, our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend. It is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenue-producing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them. We face numerous challenges in this regard, including the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses and the general mobility of professionals in our businesses.

Losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services.

18

Our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

To remain competitive in many of our business areas, we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings. We also have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy. In addition to new platforms and systems, we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies. If we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business.

Companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients merge

or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. Any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

We face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses.

We have a history of making acquisitions, including a total of 49 acquisitions in the period 2009-2013 for aggregate purchase consideration of $1.9 billion. We have also exited various businesses, including the sale of Kroll in 2010. We expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy. Our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue.

While we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations. Acquisitions involve special risks, including accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company; the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies; difficulties in integrating acquired businesses; and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if in the future, the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions, or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts. As of December 31, 2013, the Company's consolidated balance sheet reflected $7.4 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, representing approximately 44% of the Company's total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows: Risk and Insurance Services, $5.1 billion and Consulting, $2.3 billion. Given the significant size of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets, an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period. 

When we dispose of businesses, we are subject to the risk, contractually agreed or otherwise, of post-transaction liabilities. For example, as described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report, we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to Kroll.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR RISK AND INSURANCE SERVICES SEGMENT

Our Risk and Insurance Services segment, conducted through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, represented 54% of the Company's total revenue in 2013. Our business in this segment is subject to particular risks.

19

Results in our Risk and Insurance Services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity.

Demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows. This dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. To the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage, as applicable, which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue, the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets, property values, sales or number of employees, which may reduce our commission revenue, and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services, which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue. Moreover, insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Guy Carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place.

Volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability.

A significant portion of our Risk and Insurance Services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. Our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.

In addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs. Further, the profitability of our Risk and Insurances Services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated, not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions, but also for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services, our margins and profitability could suffer.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR CONSULTING SEGMENT

Our Consulting segment, conducted through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group, represented 46% of our total revenue in 2013. Our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks.

Demand for our services might decrease for various reasons, including a general economic downturn, a decline in a client's or an industry's financial condition, or changes in government regulation.

Global economic conditions over the past several years have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions. Many of our clients, including financial institutions, corporations, governmental entities and pension plans, have been reducing expenses, including amounts spent on consulting services. The evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and may reduce demand for our services. If the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, demand for many of Mercer's benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules, which drive our clients' needs for benefits-related services. For example, significant changes in government regulations affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans, or defined benefit plans, may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of Mercer's services.

20

Factors impacting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect Mercer.

Mercer currently provides corporate, multi-employer and public clients with actuarial, consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans. The nature of our work is complex. Our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events, including interest rates used to discount future liabilities, estimated rates of return for a plan's assets, healthcare cost trends, salary projections and participants' life expectancies. Our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans. Our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures. Clients dissatisfied with our services have brought, and may bring, significant claims against us, particularly in the 

U.S. and the U.K. In addition, a number of Mercer's clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for Mercer's retirement business. These developments could adversely affect Mercer's business and operating results.

Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants.

The profitability of our Consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates (i.e., the percentage of our consultants' working hours devoted to billable activities). Our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:

•our ability to transition consultants promptly from completed projects to new assignments, and to engage newly-hired consultants quickly in revenue-generating activities;

•our ability to continually secure new business engagements, particularly because a portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature;

•our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;

•our ability to manage attrition;

•unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;

•the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted;

•our need to devote time and resources to sales, training, professional development and other non-billable activities;

•the potential disruptive impact of acquisitions and dispositions; and

•general economic conditions.

If the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.

In addition, the profitability of our Consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services. The prices we charge are affected by a number of factors, including:

•clients' perception of our ability to add value through our services;

•market demand for the services we provide;

•our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors;

•the pricing policies of our competitors;

•the extent to which our clients develop in-house or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us; and

•general economic conditions.

If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.
