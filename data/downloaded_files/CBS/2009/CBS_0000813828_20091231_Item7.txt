Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  

 Overview  

 For 2009, CBS Corp. reported revenues of $13.01 billion, down 7% from $13.95 billion in 2008 primarily driven by lower local advertising revenues, including lower political advertising. Advertising sales during 2009 continued to be impacted by softness in the worldwide advertising marketplace resulting from the economic recession; however, advertising comparisons improved during the latter part of the year. For the year, advertising revenues decreased 12% while fourth quarter was down only 1%. Revenues for 2009 also benefited from increased domestic syndication availabilities over 2008 and growth in affiliate and subscription fees, reflecting subscriber growth, rate increases, and higher retransmission revenues.  

 The Company reported operating income of $1.01 billion for 2009 versus an operating loss of $12.16 billion for 2008 and net earnings of $226.5 million, or $.33 per diluted share, for 2009 versus a net loss of $11.67 billion, or a loss of $17.43 per diluted share, for 2008. Results included pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million ($131.2 million, net of tax), or $.19 per diluted share, in 2009 and $14.18 billion ($12.73 billion, net of tax), or $19.00 per diluted share, in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Operating income and net earnings for 2009 compared to 2008 also reflect lower revenues, as discussed above, and higher investment in content, partially offset by lower employee-related costs and other expenses resulting from cost-savings initiatives, and lower restructuring charges.  

 The Company generated cash flow from operating activities of $939.4 million for 2009 versus $2.15 billion for 2008 principally reflecting lower revenues, higher investment in content and a $150.0 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the revolving accounts receivable securitization program, partially offset by the impact of cost-savings initiatives and lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures of $261.6 million for 2009 decreased $212.5 million from $474.1 million for 2008.  

 For 2009, free cash flow was $827.8 million versus $1.67 billion for 2008. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and operating cash flow from discontinued operations, and less capital expenditures. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information" on pages II13 and II-14 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), to free cash flow.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company realigned its management structure to more effectively pursue its long-term strategy of investing in content businesses and capitalizing on its strong local presence. As a result, the Company realigned its operating segments. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  

CBS Corp. operates in the following segments:  

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios,  CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Films and CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, content licensing and distribution, and affiliate and subscription fees. Entertainment contributed 54%, 49% and 47% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and content licensing and distribution. Cable Networks contributed 10%, 9% and 8% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as  Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Free Press. Publishing contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.  

LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales. Local Broadcasting contributed 18%, 21% and 24% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

OUTDOOR: The Outdoor segment, principally through CBS Outdoor, displays advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales. Outdoor contributed 13% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 16% for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Advertising sales decreased 12% to $8.17 billion in 2009 from $9.24 billion in 2008 principally reflecting softness in the advertising marketplace resulting from the weak economic environment, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes and lower political advertising sales, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET Networks, Inc. ("CNET") in June 2008. For 2009, national television advertising sales decreased 2% and local advertising sales decreased 20%. Advertising trends during 2009 showed improvement each quarter. For 2009, as compared to the same prior-year period, national television advertising sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 1% in the third quarter, and declined 6% and 9% in the second and first quarters, respectively; local advertising revenues decreased 8% for the fourth quarter, 20% for the third quarter and 26% for each of the second and first quarters of 2009. In 2010, the Company's advertising revenues will benefit from the telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and higher expected political advertising sales from mid-term political elections. Advertising revenues are affected by the health of the economy and accordingly, the Company's advertising sales growth during 2010 will vary based on the extent of the economic recovery. In 2008, advertising sales decreased 8% to $9.24 billion from $10.06 billion in 2007 reflecting weakness in the television and radio advertising markets, the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on the CBS Television Network, lower primetime ratings for the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partly as a result of the Writers Guild of America ("WGA") strike, and the impact of television and radio station divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of CNET and higher political advertising sales due to the 2008 presidential election.  

 Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced programming to television and digital mediums as well as from retail merchandising, including home entertainment; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 1% to $3.12 billion in 2009 from $3.16 billion in 2008 principally reflecting 7% lower publishing revenues due to the soft retail market and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, and 16% lower home entertainment revenues. Syndication revenues increased in 2009 reflecting five major domestic syndication availabilities,  Medium, Criminal Minds, Ghost Whisperer, Everybody Hates Chris and Numb3rs and higher international syndication sales, partially offset by the 2008 domestic syndication sale of CSI: NY and the initial impact of a new international syndication arrangement for the CSI: franchise in 2008. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 23% to $3.16 billion in 2008 from $2.57 billion in 2007 primarily reflecting higher syndication revenues due to the domestic syndication sale of CSI: NY, the impact of a new international syndication arrangement for the CSI: franchise and 16% higher home entertainment revenues, reflecting the mix of available DVD releases. These increases were partially offset by 3% lower publishing revenues.  

 Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of affiliate fees received from cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators, telephone companies ("Telcos") and other distributors of cable program services; retransmission revenues from the carriage of the CBS Television

Network and CBS Television Stations; subscriber fees for online content; and fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. Affiliate and subscription fees increased 13% to $1.46 billion in 2009 from $1.29 billion in 2008 and increased 8% to $1.29 billion in 2008 from $1.19 billion in 2007 principally reflecting growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network, higher retransmission revenues and the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008.  

 Other revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor operations, decreased 1% to $260.5 million in 2009 from $263.5 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the absence of 2008 revenues associated with certain of the Company's former agreements with Westwood One, Inc., which were concluded during the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008. For 2008, other revenues increased 6% to $263.5 million from $249.5 million in 2007 primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of CNET partially offset by lower revenues associated with certain of the Company's former agreements with Westwood One, Inc.  

 International Revenues  

 The Company generated approximately 14% of its total revenues from international regions in 2009, 16% in 2008 and 12% in 2007. International revenues for 2008 reflected the initial impact of a new international syndication arrangement for the CSI: franchise.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Expenses  

 For 2009, operating expenses of $8.70 billion increased 1% from $8.65 billion in 2008 principally reflecting the acquisition of CNET in June 2008 and higher television programming costs partially offset by lower employee-related and other operating costs resulting from cost-savings initiatives, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. For 2008, operating expenses of $8.65 billion increased 4% from $8.33 billion in 2007 principally reflecting higher television production costs, the acquisition of CNET and increased outdoor operations expenses partially offset by lower television programming costs.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The table below presents the Company's consolidated operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Programming expenses represented 38% of total operating expenses in 2009 and 2008, and 41% in 2007, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses increased 1% to $3.34 billion in 2009 from $3.29 billion in 2008 reflecting higher television series costs, principally from the impact of the WGA strike which reduced programming costs for the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partially offset by lower costs from more internally produced series airing on the CBS Television Network for the 2009/2010 broadcast season. Programming expenses decreased 3% to $3.29 billion in 2008 from $3.39 billion in 2007 principally reflecting lower sports programming costs from the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on the CBS Television Network and lower costs in 2008 due to the impact of the WGA strike, partially offset by higher cable programming costs.  

 Production expenses represented 30% of total operating expenses in 2009 and 2008, and 28% in 2007, and reflect the costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, and production overhead, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses increased $9.6 million to $2.58 billion in 2009 from $2.57 billion in 2008 reflecting higher costs associated with higher syndication sales and costs for new television series partially offset by the initial impact of a new international syndication arrangement for the CSI: franchise in 2008, and lower radio talent costs. Production expenses increased 10% to $2.57 billion in 2008 from $2.33 billion in 2007 primarily reflecting higher costs associated with higher syndication sales, principally for the CSI: series, partially offset by lower costs due to the impact of the WGA strike, which resulted in fewer episodes and pilots produced in 2008, and the cancellation of certain television series.  

 Outdoor operations expenses represented 13% of total operating expenses in 2009, 15% in 2008 and 14% in 2007, and reflect transit, billboard lease, maintenance, posting and rotation expenses. Outdoor operations expenses decreased 8% to $1.17 billion in 2009 from $1.27 billion in 2008 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and lower billboard lease costs in Europe. Outdoor operations expenses increased 8% to $1.27 billion in 2008 from $1.18 billion in 2007 primarily due to contractual increases in billboard lease and transit costs and the impact of acquisitions.  

 Publishing operations expenses, which represented 6% of total operating expenses for 2009 and 7% for each of 2008 and 2007, reflect the cost of book sales, royalties and other costs incurred with respect to publishing operations. Publishing operations expenses decreased $1.2 million to $565.3 million in 2009 from $566.5 million in 2008 principally reflecting lower production expenses driven by the decrease in revenues, and lower freight and delivery costs, partially offset by higher royalty expenses. Publishing

operations expenses decreased 4% to $566.5 million in 2008 from $590.1 million in 2007 reflecting lower royalty and production expenses driven by the decrease in revenues, which was largely due to lower sales of the best-selling title The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.  

 Other operating expenses, which represented 12% of total operating expenses in 2009, 11% in 2008 and 10% in 2007, primarily include distribution expenses incurred with respect to television product, costs associated with digital media, and compensation costs. Other operating expenses increased 11% to $1.05 billion in 2009 from $948.4 million in 2008 primarily reflecting increased costs associated with digital media, including the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008, partially offset by lower employee-related costs due to restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. Other operating expenses increased 14% to $948.4 million in 2008 from $835.0 million in 2007 due to increased costs associated with digital media, including the impact of the acquisition of CNET, and higher television distribution costs.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. SG&A expenses decreased $120.3 million, or 5%, to $2.49 billion in 2009 from $2.61 billion in 2008, primarily due to lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives implemented across the Company's segments, lower selling expenses driven by the revenue decline, lower advertising expenses, the favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement and gains on the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets. These decreases were partially offset by increased pension costs and the impact of the acquisition of CNET. In 2009, pension and postretirement benefits expenses increased $91.0 million from 2008 due to pension plan asset performance in 2008.  

 For 2008, SG&A expenses decreased $57.4 million, or 2%, to $2.61 billion from $2.67 billion in 2007, primarily reflecting lower costs resulting from cost-savings initiatives, the settlement of an international receivable claim, lower postretirement benefits expenses, and lower expenses due to the divestitures of television and radio stations, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and higher stock-based compensation expense. In 2008, pension and postretirement benefits expenses decreased $15.2 million from 2007 due to higher actuarial gains related to postretirement plans.  

 Restructuring Charges  

 During the year ended December 31, 2009, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $22.8 million, reflecting $20.8 million of severance costs associated with the elimination of positions and $6.7 million of contract termination and other associated costs, partially offset by the reversal of $4.7 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $136.7 million, which reflected $127.5 million of severance costs and $9.2 million of contract termination and other associated costs. As of December 31, 2009, the Company paid $115.2 million of the severance costs and $4.5 million of the contract termination and other associated costs. The Company expects to substantially utilize these reserves by the end of 2010.

 The following tables set forth the 2009 and 2008 activity for the restructuring charges by segment.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impairment Charges  

 The Company performs an annual fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its book value.  

 Based on the 2009 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units is greater than its carrying value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed principally based upon the present value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow Method) and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses (Market Comparable Method). The Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method is based on the Company's estimated long-range growth rates for the projection period plus the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate between 2.0% and 3.5%. The present value of the future cash flows during the projection period and the estimated residual value is discounted using the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. These discount rates range from 8.5% to 11%. The individual carrying values of certain reporting units are within 10% of their respective estimated fair values, primarily reflecting the 2008 impairment charge which reduced goodwill to the then current estimated fair value. The aggregate carrying value of goodwill at these reporting units was $5.01 billion at December 31, 2009.  

 As a result of the Company's annual impairment test of FCC licenses, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $178.3 million at the Local Broadcasting segment to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. This impairment resulted from reductions in

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

projections for advertising revenues due to a weakened radio advertising marketplace. FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset by market with its book value. The estimated fair value of FCC licenses is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up operation, the total market advertising revenue trend in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections.  

 Also in 2009, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $31.7 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $20.7 million and the allocated goodwill by $11.0 million.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test as a result of its assessment of factors, including the continuation of adverse market conditions, which affected the Company's market value and trading multiples for entities within the Company's industry, as well as the continued economic slowdown which adversely affected the Company's advertising revenues, primarily at the Company's local businesses. As a result of this interim impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14.12 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill by $10.99 billion and intangible assets by $3.13 billion. The charge was reflected as a reduction to goodwill at the Entertainment segment of $3.80 billion, the Local Broadcasting segment of $4.34 billion and the Outdoor segment of $2.85 billion as well as a reduction to the carrying value of intangible assets related to FCC licenses at the Local Broadcasting segment of $3.12 billion and franchise agreements at the Outdoor segment of $8.2 million.  

 Also in 2008, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $30.4 million and the allocated goodwill by $31.6 million.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization increased $50.7 million, or 10%, to $582.3 million for 2009 from $531.6 million for 2008 and increased $75.9 million, or 17%, to $531.6 million for 2008 from $455.7 million in 2007, in both cases principally reflecting higher depreciation and amortization associated with fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in June 2008 in connection with CNET and higher depreciation resulting from capital expenditures at Outdoor.  

 Interest Expense  

 For 2009, interest expense decreased $4.6 million to $542.0 million from $546.6 million in 2008. For 2008, interest expense decreased $24.3 million to $546.6 million from $570.9 million in 2007 principally due to lower interest rates. The Company had $7.00 billion of principal amounts of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at both December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.2% and 7.1%, respectively.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income decreased $36.2 million to $6.0 million for 2009 from $42.2 million for 2008 and decreased $73.9 million to $42.2 million for 2008 from $116.1 million for 2007, in both cases reflecting lower interest rates and lower average cash balances.  

II-11 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

 For 2009, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $29.8 million reflected a pre-tax loss associated with the repurchase of $978.3 million of the Company's 7.70% senior notes due 2010.  

 For 2008, the gain on early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million reflected the pre-tax gain recognized upon the repurchase of $191.8 million of the Company's 7.70% senior notes due 2010.  

 Other Items, Net  

 For 2009, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $2.6 million principally consisting of foreign exchange gains of $11.1 million, $6.7 million of losses associated with securitizing accounts receivables and a non-cash charge of $7.7 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments.  

 For 2008, "Other items, net" of $79.6 million principally consisted of foreign exchange gains of $32.3 million, $15.4 million of losses associated with securitizing accounts receivables, a gain of $129.8 million on the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel, a non-cash charge of $71.1 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments and a gain of $3.7 million relating to radio station divestitures.  

 For 2007, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $34.0 million principally consisting of foreign exchange gains of $8.0 million, $32.0 million of losses associated with securitizing accounts receivables, a non-cash charge of $24.8 million associated with an other-than-temporary decline in the market value of one of the Company's investments, a net gain of $10.0 million on television and radio station divestitures and gains of $3.9 million on the sale of investments.  

 (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. The Company reported an income tax provision of $182.8 million in 2009 versus an income tax benefit of $919.3 million in 2008 and an income tax provision of $821.5 million in 2007, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 41.3% in 2009, 7.3% in 2008 and 38.5% in 2007.  

 Included in the income tax rate were benefits of $78.8 million in 2009 and $1.45 billion in 2008 associated with the non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. The tax rate also included tax benefits of $47.0 million in 2009, $39.6 million in 2008 and $8.0 million in 2007, from the net impact of tax audit settlements, provisions of $54.7 million in 2008 and $68.5 million in 2007, relating to gains on divestitures, and reductions of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation of $42.6 million in 2009 and $7.2 million in 2008. This reduction reflects the difference between the estimated tax benefit recognized based on the grant date fair value of the stock-based compensation award versus the actual tax benefit realized based on the market value on the date of vest.  

 For 2010, the Company's annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 40%.  

 Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  

 Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $33.7 million for 2009, $17.6 million for 2008 and $80.7 million for 2007 reflecting the Company's share of the operating results of its equity investments. The net loss in 2007 also reflected non-cash charges of $62.9 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's equity investments.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations  

 For the year ended December 31, 2007, net earnings from discontinued operations of $16.2 million principally reflected adjustments to the gain on the 2006 sale of Paramount Parks.  

 Net Earnings (Loss)  

 For 2009, the Company reported net earnings of $226.5 million versus a net loss of $11.67 billion in 2008 and net earnings of $1.25 billion in 2007. Comparability of net earnings in 2009 and 2008 was impacted by several large discrete items, including non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million ($131.2 million, net of tax) in 2009 and $14.18 billion ($12.73 billion, net of tax) in 2008, a gain on the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel of $129.8 million ($79.9 million, net of tax) in 2008 and the net impact of tax audit settlements and reductions of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation of $4.4 million in 2009 and $32.4 million in 2008.  

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  

 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and operating cash flow from discontinued operations, and less capital expenditures. The Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

 The Company's calculation of free cash flow does not include increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program because the Company does not consider the cash flow from this program to be indicative of the cash generated by the underlying operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, the Company considers its decision to increase or decrease its accounts receivable securitization program a financing decision. Also, the Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures since investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations.  

 Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.  

 As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, and does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by operating activities, the

most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected in free cash flow.

 Segment Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007  

 In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company realigned its management structure to more effectively pursue its long-term strategy of investing in content businesses and capitalizing on its strong local presence. As a result, the Company realigned its operating segments. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  

 The following tables present the Company's revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges"), operating income (loss), depreciation and amortization and impairment charges by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company presents Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges to the Company's consolidated Net earnings (loss) is presented in Note 15 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

 Segment Results of Operations2009 vs. 2008 and 2008 vs. 2007  

 Entertainment (CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Films and CBS Interactive)  

 (Contributed 54%, 49% and 47% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.)

 NMNot meaningful   

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $6.98 billion from $6.88 billion in 2008 primarily reflecting higher content licensing and distribution revenues and the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008 partially offset by lower advertising sales. Revenues from content licensing and distribution increased 1% primarily due to higher domestic syndication sales in 2009, which included the first cycle sales of Medium,  Criminal Minds, Ghost Whisperer, Everybody Hates Chris and Numb3rs, compared to 2008, which included the domestic syndication sale of CSI: NY, and higher international syndication sales. These increases were partially offset by the initial impact of a new international syndication arrangement for the  CSI: franchise in 2008 and lower home entertainment sales, as higher sales of certain titles in 2009 including Gossip Girl and NCIS were more than offset by prior year sales of Charmed and other library titles. Advertising sales decreased slightly reflecting 2% lower national television advertising sales as a result of softness in the advertising marketplace during the first half of 2009, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET. CBS Interactive revenues increased 30% to $550.3 million in 2009 from $421.7 million in 2008, as CBS Interactive results for the first half of 2008 did not include $188.8 million of 2008 revenues generated from CNET, which was acquired in June 2008. CBS Interactive revenues also reflected lower display advertising due to the soft advertising marketplace resulting from the weak economic environment.  

 For 2009, Entertainment reported operating income of $699.9 million compared to an operating loss of $2.91 billion in 2008, which included non-cash impairment charges of $3.80 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. Entertainment OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 14% to $875.9 million in 2009 from $1.02 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower advertising sales, higher investment in programming, including the impact of the WGA strike which reduced programming costs for the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partially offset by higher profits from syndication sales and the absence of $22.9 million of restructuring charges incurred in 2008. Restructuring charges in 2008 reflected severance costs associated  

II-16 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

with the elimination of positions and 2009 reflected the reversal of $.6 million due to changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Entertainment results included stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million for 2009 and $47.4 million for 2008.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $53.4 million to $72.4 million in 2009 from $125.8 million in 2008 primarily due to 2008 spending for broadcast facilities and high-definition television upgrades.  

 License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on cable are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $387.0 million and $600.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Entertainment revenues increased 5% to $6.88 billion from $6.57 billion in 2007 primarily reflecting higher revenues from content licensing and distribution and the impact of the acquisition of CNET partially offset by lower advertising sales. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 34% principally reflecting higher domestic and international sales of the CSI: series, including the impact of a new international syndication arrangement for the CSI: franchise in 2008. Advertising sales decreased 8% reflecting the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on the CBS Television Network and lower primetime ratings during the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partly as a result of the WGA strike which was settled in February 2008, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET. CBS Interactive revenues increased $255.6 million to $421.7 million in 2008 from $166.1 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008 and higher advertising sales.  

 For 2008, Entertainment reported an operating loss of $2.91 billion, which included non-cash impairment charges of $3.80 billion principally to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, compared with operating income of $959.0 million for 2007. Entertainment OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 3% to $1.02 billion in 2008 from $1.05 billion in 2007 primarily due to restructuring charges of $22.9 million incurred in 2008. Results also reflect lower advertising sales primarily offset by higher profits from syndication sales, principally from the CSI: series, lower sports programming costs associated with the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI, lower television series costs reflecting the impact of the WGA strike and the impact of the acquisition of CNET. Entertainment results included stock-based compensation expense of $47.4 million for 2008 and $33.0 million for 2007.  

 Acquisition  

 During June 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of CNET for $1.8 billion.

 (Contributed 10%, 9% and 8% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Cable Networks revenues increased 7% to $1.35 billion from $1.26 billion in 2008 primarily due to 7% higher affiliate fees reflecting growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network. At December 31, 2009, Showtime Networks, including  Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate, had 61.3 million subscriptions, up by 2.6 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2008, reflecting increased DBS and Telco subscriptions partially offset by a decline in cable subscriptions. At December 31, 2009, CBS College Sports Network subscriptions of 34.8 million were up by 9.5 million, or 38%, from December 31, 2008, reflecting increased carriage across all platforms.

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Cable Networks revenues increased 9% to $1.26 billion from $1.16 billion in 2007 reflecting higher affiliate fees and higher international syndication and home entertainment revenues for Showtime original series. Affiliate fees increased 6% in 2008 primarily due to growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network. At December 31, 2008, Showtime Networks, in the aggregate, had 58.7 million subscriptions, up by 3.9 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2007, reflecting increased cable and Telco subscriptions. CBS College Sports Network subscriptions of 25.3 million at December 31, 2008 were up by 3.9 million, or 18%, from December 31, 2007, reflecting growth in cable subscriptions.  

 For 2008, Cable Networks operating income increased 21% to $364.3 million from $300.5 million in 2007 and OIBDA increased 19% to $389.5 million from $326.3 million for 2007, primarily due to higher affiliate fees, partially offset by higher theatrical programming costs and restructuring charges of $2.9 million incurred in 2008. The restructuring charges in 2008 reflected severance costs associated with

the elimination of positions. Cable Networks results included stock-based compensation expense of $8.6 million for 2008 and $6.6 million for 2007.  

 Publishing (Simon & Schuster)  

 (Contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Publishing revenues decreased 7% to $793.5 million from $857.7 million in 2008, principally reflecting a soft retail market and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes partially offset by growth of $16.1 million in digital sales of Publishing content. In constant dollars, Publishing revenues decreased 6% from 2008. Best-selling titles in 2009 included Arguing with Idiots by Glenn Beck and Kevin Balfe and  Under the Dome by Stephen King.  

 For 2009, Publishing operating income decreased 46% to $42.5 million from $78.7 million in 2008 and OIBDA decreased 43% to $50.2 million from $88.2 million in 2008 primarily driven by the revenue decline and higher royalty expenses, partially offset by lower production and delivery costs resulting from the revenue decrease, and lower selling, advertising and employee-related costs due to restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. Restructuring charges of $3.8 million in 2009 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $3.5 million for 2009 and $4.2 million for 2008.  

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Publishing revenues decreased 3% to $857.7 million from $886.1 million for 2007, principally reflecting lower book sales due to difficult comparisons with 2007, which included the release of the best-seller The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. Best-selling titles in 2008 included YOU: Being Beautiful by Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz, The Purpose of Christmas by Rick Warren, Duma Key by Stephen King and The War Within by Bob Woodward.  

 For 2008, Publishing operating income decreased 11% to $78.7 million from $88.1 million in 2007 and OIBDA decreased 9% to $88.2 million from $97.2 million in 2007. These decreases reflected the revenue decline, restructuring charges of $4.2 million incurred during 2008 and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower royalty expenses and production costs, resulting from the revenue decline and the mix of titles, and a decline in employee-related expenses. The restructuring charges in 2008 principally consisted

of severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million for 2008 and $3.5 million for 2007.  

 Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio)  

 (Contributed 18%, 21% and 24% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

NMNot meaningful   

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 20% to $2.36 billion from $2.95 billion for 2008 primarily reflecting lower advertising sales from the impact of the economic recession and lower political advertising sales. Revenues for CBS Television Stations decreased 20% to $1.14 billion for 2009 from $1.41 billion for 2008, reflecting lower non-political advertising during the first three quarters of 2009 and lower political advertising sales for the year due to the 2008 presidential election, partially offset by higher non-political advertising sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. CBS Radio revenues decreased 21% to $1.22 billion for 2009 from $1.54 billion for 2008 and revenues from the ten largest radio markets decreased 17%, reflecting softness in the advertising marketplace resulting from the weak economic environment, lower political advertising sales and the impact of station divestitures.  

 For 2009, Local Broadcasting reported operating income of $212.4 million versus an operating loss of $6.81 billion for 2008. Included in 2009 operating income were non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets and to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill in connection with the sale of certain radio stations. Included in the 2008 operating loss were non-cash impairment charges of $7.53 billion principally to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 37% to $512.9 million for 2009 from $820.0 million for 2008 primarily due to the decrease in revenues partially offset by $89.7 million lower restructuring charges in 2009, lower talent, employee-related, marketing and promotion costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and lower selling expenses driven by the revenue decline. Local Broadcasting results for 2009 also benefited from gains of $40.3 million from the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets. Restructuring charges of $2.3 million in 2009 reflected $4.7 million of contract termination costs related to exiting a broadcasting equipment lease upon completion of the digital conversion, partially offset by the reversal of $2.4 million  

II-20

as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Local Broadcasting results included stock-based compensation expense of $20.7 million for 2009 and $27.0 million for 2008.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $39.2 million, or 36%, to $70.4 million for 2009 from $109.6 million for 2008 principally reflecting 2008 spending associated with the relocation of local broadcasting facilities and high-definition television upgrades.  

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 14% to $2.95 billion from $3.45 billion in 2007 primarily due to lower advertising sales. Revenues for CBS Television Stations decreased 17% to $1.41 billion for 2008 from $1.70 billion for 2007, reflecting the declining advertising marketplace and the absence of the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS, partially offset by higher political advertising sales. CBS Radio revenues decreased 12% to $1.54 billion for 2008 from $1.75 billion for 2007, reflecting the declining advertising marketplace and the impact of radio station divestitures. The station divestitures negatively impacted the CBS Radio revenue comparison by 1% in 2008.  

 For 2008, Local Broadcasting reported an operating loss of $6.81 billion, which included non-cash impairment charges of $7.53 billion principally to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, versus operating income of $1.13 billion for 2007. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 34% to $820.0 million for 2008 from $1.24 billion for 2007 primarily due to lower advertising sales, restructuring charges of $92.0 million incurred during 2008, and the impact of radio station divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by lower talent, employee-related, marketing and promotion costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives implemented during 2008, as well as lower sports programming costs. The restructuring charges in 2008 principally reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions, contract termination and other associated costs. Local Broadcasting results included stock-based compensation expense of $27.0 million for 2008 and $25.9 million for 2007.  

 Dispositions  

 On September 30, 2009, the Company completed the sale of four of its owned radio stations in Portland, Oregon to Alpha Broadcasting for $40.0 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $31.7 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill.  

 On April 1, 2009, the Company completed a transaction with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. for the swap of five of its mid-size market stations in Baltimore, Portland, Sacramento and Seattle, for two radio stations in Houston, a top 10 radio market. On March 6, 2009, the Company completed the sale of three of its owned radio stations in Denver to Wilks Broadcasting for $19.5 million. During 2008, in connection with these two transactions, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill.  

 On January 10, 2008, the Company completed the sale of seven of its owned television stations in Austin, Salt Lake City, Providence and West Palm Beach to Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. for $185.0 million.

 Outdoor (CBS Outdoor)  

 (Contributed 13% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 16% for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

NMNot meaningful   

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Outdoor revenues decreased 21% to $1.72 billion from $2.17 billion for 2008, due to lower advertising sales resulting from a weak advertising marketplace worldwide and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Revenues for the Americas (comprised of North America and South America) decreased 16% primarily due to revenue declines of 16% in the U.S. billboards business, 17% in the U.S. displays business and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, revenues for the Americas decreased 15% from 2008. Revenues for Europe and Asia decreased 27% driven by lower advertising sales due to a weak advertising marketplace and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, revenues for Europe and Asia decreased 20% from 2008. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $97 million for 2009. Approximately 47% and 50% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 For 2009, Outdoor reported an operating loss of $96.9 million versus an operating loss of $2.63 billion for 2008, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $2.86 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Outdoor OIBDA before impairment charges decreased $298.7 million, or 64%, to $168.7 million for 2009 from $467.4 million for 2008 principally driven by the decline in advertising sales partially offset by lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. In addition, Outdoor's franchise and lease costs are generally fixed in nature and, due to the difficult advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground contract which also has reduced revenues due to project delays, are operating at their minimum guarantee levels, therefore adversely impacting OIBDA and operating income margins. The restructuring charges of $17.2 million for 2009 primarily reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in Europe and contract termination and other associated costs partially offset by a reversal of $1.7 million due to changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million for 2009 versus $7.3 million for 2008.  

II-22

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Capital expenditures decreased $104.7 million to $91.0 million in 2009 from $195.7 million in 2008 primarily reflecting decreased spending for transit contracts in the United Kingdom.  

 2008 vs. 2007  

 For 2008, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% to $2.17 billion from $2.19 billion for 2007, reflecting a decline in the Americas partially offset by growth in Europe and Asia. Revenues for the Americas decreased 2% from 2007 primarily due to lower revenues in the U.S. billboards business and the impact of the non-renewal of contracts partially offset by the acquisition of International Outdoor Advertising Group ("IOA") in April 2008 and the inclusion of the results of CBS Outernet since its acquisition in October 2007. The non-renewal of two major municipal contracts in Toronto and San Francisco negatively impacted the revenue comparison in the Americas by 1% for the year. The acquisition of IOA favorably impacted the Americas revenue comparison by 2% for the year. Revenues for Europe and Asia increased 1% from 2007 principally due to revenue growth in the China and France markets. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $3 million for 2008. Approximately 50% and 48% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 For 2008, Outdoor reported an operating loss of $2.63 billion, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $2.86 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, compared with operating income of $404.9 million for 2007. Outdoor OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 25% to $467.4 million for 2008 from $620.9 million for 2007 principally driven by lower revenues, higher transit and billboard lease costs, the impact of the non-renewal of contracts and restructuring charges of $13.2 million incurred during 2008. The restructuring charges at Outdoor for 2008 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in the U.S., Europe and Mexico. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $7.3 million for 2008 versus $5.3 million for 2007.  

 Acquisitions  

 On April 23, 2008, the Company acquired IOA, the leading out-of-home advertising company in South America, for $110.8 million.  

 On October 5, 2007, the Company acquired SignStorey, Inc., a distributor of video programming and advertising content to retail stores, for $71.5 million. SignStorey, Inc. has been renamed CBS Outernet.  

 Corporate  

 For 2009, corporate expenses decreased 3% to $166.0 million from $170.3 million for 2008, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement partially offset by higher expenses, including higher stock-based compensation, resulting from an increase in the Company's stock price. For 2008, corporate expenses decreased 1% to $170.3 million from $171.5 million for 2007. Corporate expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $55.3 million for 2009, $43.4 million for 2008 and $32.3 million for 2007.  

 Residual Costs  

 Residual costs primarily include pension and postretirement benefits costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. For 2009, residual costs increased 46% to $115.7 million from $79.2 million for 2008, primarily reflecting an increase in pension costs due to pension plan asset performance in 2008 partially offset by a settlement of $28.0 million related to the favorable

resolution of certain disputes regarding a previously disposed business. For 2008, residual costs decreased 18% to $79.2 million from $96.5 million for 2007 primarily due to higher actuarial gains related to postretirement benefit plans.  

 Financial Position  

 Current assets increased by $421.0 million to $5.64 billion at December 31, 2009 from $5.22 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. The increase in accounts receivables principally reflected the $150.0 million reduction to the accounts receivable securitization program. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 4.7% at December 31, 2009 compared with 5.0% at December 31, 2008.  

 Net property and equipment decreased $149.6 million to $2.86 billion at December 31, 2009 from $3.01 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $448.7 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $261.6 million and foreign currency translation adjustments.  

 Goodwill increased $19.7 million to $8.67 billion at December 31, 2009 from $8.65 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by the disposition of certain radio stations.  

 Intangible assets, principally consisting of FCC licenses, leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, decreased by $350.5 million to $6.75 billion at December 31, 2009 from $7.10 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the impairment of FCC licenses in certain radio markets, amortization expense of $133.6 million and the disposition of certain radio stations.  

 Current liabilities decreased $54.4 million to $4.75 billion at December 31, 2009 from $4.80 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting a decrease in other current liabilities resulting from lower dividends payable due to a decrease in the quarterly cash dividend rate, and decreases in accrued expenses, accrued compensation and program rights obligations due to the timing of payments, partially offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt. The increase in current portion of long-term debt reflects the Company's present intention to repay its 7.70% notes due July 2010 upon maturity.  

 Cash Flows  

 Cash and cash equivalents increased by $297.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and decreased by $927.4 million and $1.73 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:

In 2009, cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.21 billion to $939.4 million from $2.15 billion in 2008 principally reflecting lower advertising sales, higher investment in content, and a $150.0 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the revolving accounts receivable securitization program, partially offset by lower employee-related payments due to recent restructuring activities and lower cash taxes paid. In 2008, cash provided by operating activities decreased $38.7 million,

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

to $2.15 billion from $2.19 billion in 2007 principally reflecting lower operating income, partially offset by higher cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and lower cash taxes paid. The Company made discretionary contributions to pre-fund its qualified pension plans for $20.0 million in 2009, $120.0 million in 2008 and $150.0 million in 2007.  

 Cash paid for income taxes was $55.8 million for 2009, $240.3 million for 2008 and $511.5 million for 2007. The decrease in cash taxes for 2009 reflects lower taxable income and the impact of refunds received during 2009 resulting from the filing of income tax returns for prior years. The decrease in cash taxes for 2008 reflects lower operating income and a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at a lower rate.  

 Investing Activities. In 2009, cash used for investing activities of $249.2 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $261.6 million, investments in investee companies of $55.6 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW, and purchases of marketable securities of $35.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $128.8 million, primarily from the sales of radio stations and certain long-lived assets of the Local Broadcasting segment. In 2008, cash used for investing activities of $2.15 billion principally reflected acquisitions of $2.04 billion, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of CNET, IOA and other outdoor advertising properties, capital expenditures of $474.1 million, and investments in investee companies of $40.2 million. These cash uses were partially offset by proceeds received of $170.0 million from the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel and dispositions of $198.2 million, primarily from television station divestitures. In 2007, cash used for investing activities of $135.1 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $469.1 million, acquisitions of $410.0 million, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of Last.fm, CBS Outernet and other outdoor advertising properties, and investments in investee companies of $42.3 million, principally reflecting the investment in several interactive companies and The CW. These cash uses were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $562.2 million, primarily from radio station divestitures, and net receipts of $172.5 million from Viacom Inc. related to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $212.5 million, or 45%, to $261.6 million in 2009 from $474.1 million in 2008 principally reflecting higher 2008 spending for outdoor transit contracts in the United Kingdom, high-definition television upgrades, and the relocation of local broadcasting facilities. For 2010, capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $250 million to $300 million.  

 Financing Activities. In 2009, cash used for financing activities of $393.0 million principally reflected the repayment of senior debt of $1.01 billion and dividend payments of $297.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $974.4 million. In 2008, cash used for financing activities of $919.8 million principally reflected dividend payments of $705.4 million and the repayment of senior notes of $183.2 million. In 2007, cash used for financing activities of $3.78 billion principally reflected the purchase of Company common stock for $3.35 billion, the repayment of senior notes of $660.0 million and dividend payments of $640.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $678.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $201.7 million.  

 Dividends  

 On February 23, 2010, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.05 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2010. The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2009, 2008 and 2007, resulting in total annual dividends of $135.8 million, $725.9 million and $667.1 million, respectively.  

II-25 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

Dividends have been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as the Company has an accumulated deficit balance.  

 Purchase of Company Stock  

 During 2007, the Company repurchased, primarily through two accelerated share repurchase transactions, 106.4 million shares of CBS Corp. Common Stock for $3.40 billion, including $64.0 million of non-cash purchases related to a television station exchange. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)  

 Capital Structure  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $2.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $92.4 million and $88.0 million, respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $6.92 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 

(b)Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

 Total debt of $7.02 billion at December 31, 2009 and $7.03 billion at December 31, 2008 was 44% and 45%, respectively, as a percentage of the total capitalization of the Company.  

 The senior debt of CBS Corp. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52.2 million of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., is not guaranteed.  

 The Company classified all of its $416.2 million 7.70% senior notes due July 2010 in the current portion of long-term debt, reflecting its present intention to repay these notes upon maturity.  

 In November 2009, prior to maturity, the Company settled $350.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $9.9 million in cash. In December 2008, prior to maturity, the Company settled $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $88.4 million in cash. The increase in the carrying value of the debt attributable to the risk hedged by these interest rate swaps is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the debt. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008.  

II-26 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the following debt issuances and repurchases occurred:  

 Debt Issuances   

June 2, 2009, $250.0 million 8.875% senior notes due 2019

 May 13, 2009, $350.0 million 8.875% senior notes due 2019

 May 13, 2009, $400.0 million 8.200% senior notes due 2014   

 Interest on the above debt instruments is paid semi-annually.  

 Debt Repurchases  

 During 2009, the Company repurchased $978.3 million of its 7.70% senior notes due 2010, $825.5 million of which was purchased through the Company's tender offer for such notes, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $29.8 million.  

 During 2008, the Company repurchased $191.8 million of its 7.70% senior notes due 2010 resulting in a pre-tax gain on early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million.  

 At December 31, 2009, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Credit Facility  

 At December 31, 2009, the Company had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires December 2012 (the "Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.  

 The following table sets forth the Company's credit ratings as of February 25, 2010.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each fiscal quarter, subject to reductions, and a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 3.0x for the trailing four quarters, each as further described in the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2009, the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 3.6x and Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 3.9x.  

II-27 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its $2.0 billion commercial paper program. At December 31, 2009, the remaining availability under this Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.837 billion.  

 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program  

 The Company's revolving accounts receivable securitization program provides for the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company entered into this arrangement because it provides an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from this program are used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization arrangement require that the receivable pools subject to the program meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization program. The program provides for a possible acceleration in the event of a continuing downgrade of the Company's long-term debt to a below-investment grade rating. The Company believes that it has sufficient capacity under its existing Credit Facility to refinance such program. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $400.0 million outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization program versus $550.0 million at December 31, 2008.  

 During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts receivables of $1.47 billion and $2.77 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with securitizing the program's accounts receivables was $6.7 million and $15.4 million for years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new FASB guidance that requires the securitized accounts receivables to be reflected on the balance sheet with a corresponding increase to debt.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends, principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness and pension funding obligations, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $1.837 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2009, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, other operating commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments, dividends and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future.  

 The Company's funding will come primarily from cash flows from operations. Any additional net cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy any short-term borrowing needs.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 On November 3, 2008, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock, Class B Common Stock (issuable only upon conversion of debt securities and preferred stock) and warrants of CBS Corp. that may be issued by the Company from time to time. The registration statement replaced the previous shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire on December 1, 2008. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by CBS Corp. for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.  

 Contractual Obligations  

 As of December 31, 2009, the Company's significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $6.63 billion for sports programming rights, $2.74 billion relating to television, radio, and film production and licensing and $906.3 million for talent contracts. 

(b)Outdoor has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 

(c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. 

(d)Consists of long-term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. Total future minimum payments of $2.32 billion include $937.0 million for Outdoor billboards. 

(e)Long-term contractual obligations including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. 

(f)Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt. 

(g)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. 

(h)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.   

 The table above excludes future contributions to the Company's pension plans and $229.7 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and periods in which cash payments relating to these items are expected to occur. In 2010, the Company expects to contribute approximately $52 million primarily to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2010, the Company expects to contribute approximately $75 million to its other postretirement benefit plans, to satisfy the Company's portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $375.4 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 Prior to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005, former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. and Grauman's Theatres LLC. In connection with the separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the separation agreement between the parties.  

 In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.  

 The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 Programming and Production Costs  

 Accounting for television and theatrical film production costs requires management's judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned ("Ultimate Revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program or theatrical film, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs or theatrical films.  

II-30 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The costs incurred in acquiring television programs are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program.  

 Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming are updated regularly based on information available as the television program and theatrical film progresses through its life cycle. Overestimating ultimate revenues or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and estimated accruals for participation expense.  

 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. The estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is computed principally based upon the present value of future cash flows. This technique includes projections which require the uses of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, discount rates, future operating margins and capital expenditures. A downward revision in the present value of future cash flows for a reporting unit or intangible assets could result in an impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  

 Reserves and Legal Matters  

 Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.  

 Pensions  

 Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average return of high quality bond portfolios, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet each of the Company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2009, the unrecognized actuarial losses decreased from the prior year end, due primarily to an increase in plan asset values. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately $5 million in 2010 pension expense and will change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $100 million. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $8 million in 2010 pension expense.  

 Income Taxes  

 The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters, for which a reserve has been established, is audited and finally resolved. During 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized tax benefits of $47.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. The Company evaluates a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $229.7 million at December 31, 2009 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.  

 Stock-based Compensation  

 The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For each award of employee stock options the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on the then current annual dividend rate. The expected stock price volatility is determined using a weighted average of historical volatility and implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS Corp. options, the Company was able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than one year.

 Legal Matters  

 Securities and Derivative Actions. On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System filed a self-styled class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company's common stock between February 26, 2008 and October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Company's failure to timely write down the value of certain assets caused the Company's reported operating results during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. On February 11, 2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha, Nebraska Civilian Employees' Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System (collectively, the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in this case; on March 5, 2009, the court granted that motion. On May 4, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which removes the Treasurer as a defendant and adds the Executive Chairman. On July 13, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action, which is pending. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation.  

 On October 2, 2009, a shareholder derivative complaint, Hatcher v. Moonves, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York naming the Company, as a nominal defendant, members of its board of directors and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer as defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached fiduciary duties by failing to timely write down the value of certain of the Company's assets and relates to the same or similar allegations in the Omaha Funds case. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, restitution from the defendants with respect to compensation, benefits and profits obtained and the institution of certain reforms to the Company's internal control functions. On December 11, 2009, another shareholder derivative complaint, Iron Workers v. Redstone, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York naming the same defendants as the Hatcher action, and making similar claims and demands. On December 28, 2009, the Hatcher and Iron Workers actions were consolidated and, on February 16, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company intends to ask the court to dismiss the consolidated complaint on various grounds.  

 On December 22, 2009, another shareholder derivative complaint, Gray v. Redstone, et al., was filed in the Supreme Court, New York County, naming the same defendants as the Hatcher and Iron Workers actions, and making similar claims and demands. The Company intends to ask the court to dismiss the complaint on various grounds.  

 Indecency Regulation. In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the Company's owned television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half-time show by the Company's television stations (the "Super Bowl Proceeding"). In May 2006, the FCC denied the Company's petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Review of the forfeiture with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Company's ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument was heard in September 2007. In July 2008, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's order to have the Company pay the forfeiture and remanded the case to the FCC. On November 18, 2008, the FCC filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the Third Circuit's decision. The petition requested that the United States Supreme Court not act on the petition until it ruled in the

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

"fleeting expletives case" mentioned below. On January 8, 2009, the Company filed its opposition to the FCC's petition for certiorari.  

 In another case involving broadcasts on another network, in June 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCC's November 2006 finding that the broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC (the "fleeting expletives case"). On March 17, 2008, the United States Supreme Court granted the FCC's petition to review the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's decision. On November 4, 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard argument in this case. On April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision reversing the Second Circuit's judgment on administrative grounds in favor of the FCC and remanding the fleeting expletives case to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit requested additional briefing and argument was heard on January 13, 2010.  

 Following the April 28, 2009 decision in the fleeting expletives case, on May 4, 2009, the United States Supreme Court remanded the Super Bowl Proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and requested supplemental briefing from the Company and the FCC, in light of the United States Supreme Court's fleeting expletives decision. Argument was heard by the Third Circuit in the Super Bowl Proceeding on February 23, 2010.  

 In March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program  Without a Trace. The FCC proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Company's owned stations. The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures.  

 Additionally, the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the Company's broadcasting stations included indecent material.  

 Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos, Environmental and Other. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships.  

 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had pending approximately 62,360 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 68,520 as of December 31, 2008 and 72,120 as of December 31, 2007. During 2009, the Company received approximately 4,200 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 10,370 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The

Company's total costs for the years 2009 and 2008 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $17.8 million and $15.0 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.  

 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.  

 The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.  

 General. On an ongoing basis, the Company defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.  

 Market Risk  

 The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.   

 Foreign Exchange Risk   

 The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in such currencies as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward

contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.  

 At December 31, 2009, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $97.1 million, of which $2.1 million relates to the hedging of future production costs and $95.0 million represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. At December 31, 2008, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $95.2 million, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.   

 Interest Rate Risk   

 All of the Company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. The Company had entered into fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements for a portion of this debt, which were designated as fair value hedges. In November 2009, prior to maturity, the Company settled its $350.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $9.9 million in cash. In December 2008, prior to maturity, the Company settled $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $88.4 million in cash. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008.   

 Credit Risk   

 The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.  

 The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2009 or 2008, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.

 Adoption of New Accounting Standards  

 Accounting Standards Codification  

 Beginning in the third quarter of 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

 In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company adopted new FASB guidance requiring enhanced annual disclosures about plan assets of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, including the Company's investment policies and strategies, major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets and any significant concentrations of risk in plan assets.  

 Subsequent Events  

 In 2009, the Company adopted new FASB guidance for subsequent events. This guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  

 Derivative Instruments  

 In the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted new FASB guidance which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities.  

 Business Combinations  

 Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted revised FASB guidance for business combinations. This revised guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest and goodwill, and expands disclosure requirements for business combinations. This guidance also amends and clarifies accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination.  

 Fair Value Measurements  

 Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new FASB guidance for its financial assets and liabilities which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted this guidance for its non-financial assets and liabilities. During August 2009, the FASB issued further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability, effective for the third quarter of 2009. This guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 Recent Pronouncements  

 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  

 In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2011. This guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on the Company-specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if Company-specific evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither Company-specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available. This guidance requires the best estimate of the selling price that would be used to sell the deliverable on a stand-alone basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  

 Variable Interest Entities  

 In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"), effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. This new model requires an assessment of whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary and required to consolidate the VIE. This guidance also requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity continues to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

 Transfers of Financial Assets  

 In June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. This amended guidance removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, establishes specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset and/or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. This guidance will require the Company to reflect the effect of its securitized accounts receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 resulted in an increase to accounts receivables of $400.0 million with a corresponding increase to debt of $400.0 million.
