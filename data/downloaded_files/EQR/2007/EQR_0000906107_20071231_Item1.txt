Item 1. Business 

General 

Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT. 

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates approximately thirty-five property management offices throughout the United States. 

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2007 owned an approximate 93.6% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (UPREIT), under which all property ownership and business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the Company include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR. 

As of December 31, 2007, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 579 properties in 24 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 152,821 units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies 

 The Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders. The Companys strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes: 

· Leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways: 

4 

· Investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets, to maximize our total return on an enterprise level; 

· Meeting the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service; 

· Engaging, retaining, and attracting the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed; and 

· Sharing resources, customers and best practices in property management and across the enterprise. 

· Owning a highly diversified portfolio by investing in target markets defined by a combination of the following criteria: 

· High barrier-to-entry (low supply); 

· Strong economic predictors (high demand); and 

· Attractive quality of life (high demand and retention). 

· Giving residents reasons to stay with the Company by providing a range of product options available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their experience through our employees and our services. 

· Being open and responsive to market realities to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long-term vision. 

Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies 

The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur within the United States. Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (OP Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. In addition, EQR may acquire or develop multifamily properties specifically to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities. 

When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally considers the following factors: 

· strategically targeted markets; 

· income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market; 

· employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant markets population; 

· barriers to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local building costs and construction costs, among other factors); 

· the location, construction quality, condition and design of the property; 

· the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; 

· the potential for capital appreciation of the property; 

· the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; 

· the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; 

· the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket); 

5 

· the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; 

· the benefits of integration into existing operations; 

· purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties, if any; 

· competition from existing multifamily properties, residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area; and 

· opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions. 

The Company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition and development strategies and at times to fund its share repurchase activities. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.

Competition 

 All of the Companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Companys ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Companys managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single-family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information with respect to competition.
