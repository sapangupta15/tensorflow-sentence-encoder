Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

An analysis of our consolidated operating results is provided below and a more detailed analysis of our segments operating results is provided in the Segment Analysis section on pages 21 to 30. 

Revenues 

Revenues increased $962 million, 9%, in 2012, compared with 2011, as increases in the Bell, Cessna, Industrial and Finance segments were partially offset by a reduction in the Textron Systems segment. The net revenue increase included the following factors: 

  ·   Higher Bell revenues of $749 million, primarily due to higher commercial aircraft volume of $476 million and an increase in V-22 program volume of $231 million, largely due to higher deliveries.   

  ·   Higher Cessna revenues of $121 million, primarily due to higher pre-owned aircraft volume of $68 million and Citation jet revenues of $57 million, reflecting a change in mix of jets sold during the period.   

  ·   Increased Industrial segment revenues of $115 million, primarily due to higher volume of $171 million, primarily reflecting higher market demand in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components and Golf, Turf Care and Light Transportation Vehicles product lines, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $80 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro.   

  ·   Higher Finance revenues of $112 million as described more fully in the Segment Analysis below.   

  ·   Lower Textron Systems revenues of $135 million, primarily due to lower volume across all product lines.    

Revenues increased $750 million, 7%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to an 8% increase in Manufacturing revenues with increases in the Cessna, Bell, and Industrial segments that were partially offset by lower revenues in the Textron Systems segment. The net revenue increase included the following factors: 

  ·   Higher Cessna revenues of $427 million, primarily due to higher volume, largely due to the impact of higher Citation jet volume and the mix of light- and mid-size jets sold during the period.   

  ·   Higher Bell revenues of $284 million, largely due to higher volume in our military programs, which included more deliveries of V-22 and H-1 aircraft.   

  ·   Increased Industrial segment revenues of $261 million, primarily due to higher volume of $138 million, mostly reflecting higher automotive industry demand, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $77 million, largely related to strengthening of the euro.   

  ·   Lower revenues at the Finance segment of $115 million, primarily attributable to the lower average finance receivable portfolio balance resulting from continued liquidation.   

  ·   Lower Textron Systems revenues of $107 million, primarily due to $140 million in lower volume in the UAS and Mission Support and Other product lines, partially offset by higher volume in the Land & Marine and Weapons and Sensors product lines of $28 million.

Cost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expense 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Manufacturing cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses together comprise our operating expenses. Changes in operating expenses are more fully discussed in our Segment Analysis below. 

Cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was 83.3% in both 2012 and 2011, and 83.5% in 2010. 

Consolidated manufacturing cost of sales increased $711 million, 8%, in 2012, compared with 2011, principally due to higher net sales volume. Cost of sales was reduced by $65 million in 2012 from foreign exchange fluctuations, primarily in the Industrial segment due to the weakening of the euro. In addition, cost of sales included $37 million in charges related to our new UAS fee-for-service contracts at Textron Systems, which were offset by the impact of 2011 charges at Textron Systems of $60 million related to the impairment of intangible assets and severance costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased $15 million, 1%, to $1,168 million in 2012, compared with 2011. The decrease was largely driven by lower operating expenses of $56 million at the Finance segment primarily associated with the exit of the non-captive business, partially offset by a $27 million charge at Cessna from an unfavorable arbitration award described more fully in the Segment Analysis below. 

Consolidated manufacturing cost of sales increased $703 million, 8%, in 2011, compared with 2010, principally due to higher sales volume in the Cessna, Bell and Industrial segments. In 2011, gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to favorable product mix and improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volume at Cessna and Bell. These improvements were partially offset by a $64 million increase in engineering and development expenses throughout our manufacturing businesses and $60 million in charges at Textron Systems related to the impairment of certain intangible assets and severance costs. In 2011, selling and administrative expense decreased $48 million, 4%, to $1.2 billion, compared with 2010, primarily due to $44 million in lower operating expense at the Finance segment, largely reflecting progress towards our exit from the non-captive commercial finance business, and a $23 million decrease in corporate expense, primarily due to the impact of changes in our stock price on compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher bid and proposal costs at Textron Systems in 2011. 

Interest Expense 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes interest for both the Finance and Manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated. Interest expense for the Finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest. 

Consolidated interest expense decreased $34 million, 14%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to lower average debt outstanding. In 2011, consolidated interest expense decreased $24 million, 9%, compared with 2010, primarily due to a decrease in the Finance group, largely due to the reduction in its debt from liquidations in the non-captive portfolio. 

Valuation Allowance on Transfer of Golf Mortgage Portfolio to Held for Sale 

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio for investment for the foreseeable future, and, accordingly, transferred $458 million of the remaining Golf Mortgage finance receivables, net of an $80 million allowance for loan losses, from the held for investment classification to the held for sale classification. These finance receivables were recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer, resulting in a $186 million charge recorded to Valuation allowance on transfer of Golf Mortgage portfolio to held for sale.

Special Charges 

There were no amounts recorded within special charges in 2012 and 2011. In 2010, special charges included restructuring charges totaling $99 million, including $76 million of severance costs. These charges were related to a global restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and included the announcement of the exit of portions of our commercial finance business. This restructuring program was substantially completed at the end of 2011. In 2010, special charges also included a $91 million non-cash pre-tax charge to reclassify a foreign exchange loss from equity to the Statement of Operations as a result of substantially liquidating a Canadian Finance entity. 

Other Losses, net 

In 2011, other losses, net included $55 million in losses on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes which was largely offset by a $52 million gain from the collection on notes receivable in connection with the disposition of the Fluid & Power business in 2008 as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 

Our effective rate was 30.9% in 2012, 28.1% in 2011 and (6.4)% in 2010, and generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to certain earnings from our operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant effective rate impact in the periods presented include primarily Canada, Belgium and China. We have not provided for U.S. taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. Our effective rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our U.S. and foreign operations. For a full reconciliation of our effective rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Subsequent to year end, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013 to retroactively reinstate and extend the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. As a result, our income tax provision in the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit that will reduce the annual effective tax rate by approximately one percent. 

Segment Analysis 

We operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: Cessna, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Finance. Segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. Segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses and special charges. The measurement for the Finance segment excludes special charges and includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest expense. 

In our discussion of comparative results for the Manufacturing group, changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume, pricing, foreign exchange and acquisitions. Additionally, changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix, inflation and cost performance. Volume changes in revenue represent increases/decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided. Pricing represents changes in unit pricing. Foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. Acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous 12 months. For segment profit, mix represents a change due to the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins. Inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension or other costs. Cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs. 

Approximately 29% of our revenues were derived from contracts with the U.S. Government in 2012. For our segments that have significant contracts with the U.S. Government, we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume, changes in program performance or changes in contract mix. Changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract. Changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. Changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes.

Cessna 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessna Revenues and Operating Expenses 

Factors contributing to the 2012 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessna delivered 181 Citation jets in 2012, compared with 183 jets in 2011, however revenues increased $121 million, 4%, in 2012, compared with 2011. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a $68 million impact from higher pre-owned aircraft volume and $57 million of higher Citation jet revenues reflecting a change in mix of new jets sold during the period. During 2012, the portion of Cessnas revenues derived from aftermarket sales and services represented 25% of Cessnas revenues, compared with 24% in the corresponding period of 2011. 

Cessnas operating expenses increased by $99 million, 3%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to the following: 

  ·   $93 million in higher direct material costs, resulting from increased pre-owned aircraft sales volume and a change in the mix of jets sold during the period.   

  ·   $35 million in cost inflation, largely reflecting a $22 million favorable benefit recorded in 2011 related to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories.   

  ·   $27 million charge from an unfavorable arbitration award described below.    

These increases were partially offset by $33 million cost reductions from improved factory efficiency and $24 million in lower engineering and development expenses. 

On November 16, 2012, in an arbitration proceeding initiated by Avcorp Industries, Inc. against Cessna, an arbitral panel entered an award against Cessna in the amount of $27 million. The dispute related to an alleged breach of a supply agreement under which Avcorp made various components for Cessna aircraft. Although we are vigorously contesting this award, we recorded a charge of $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessnas revenues increased $427 million, 17%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher Citation jet volume and the mix of light- and mid-size jets sold during the period, which had a $262 million impact, higher pre-owned aircraft volume of $76 million reflecting improved market demand and higher aftermarket volume of $62 million, in part due to continued investment in additional service offerings. We delivered 183 Citation jets in 2011, compared with 179 jets in 2010. During 2011, the portion of Cessnas revenues derived from aftermarket sales and services represented 24% of Cessnas revenues, compared with 26% in the corresponding period of 2010. 

22 

Table of Contents 

Cessnas operating expenses increased by $338 million, 13%, in 2011, compared with 2010, principally due to higher sales volume, which resulted in a $271 million increase in direct material costs and a $27 million increase in manufacturing overhead. Operating expenses also increased due to higher engineering and development expenses of $28 million, primarily due to new product development. Cost inflation was offset by a $45 million favorable benefit related to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories. In 2011, Cessna had a LIFO benefit of $22 million resulting from operational improvements that led to a reduction in inventory levels, compared with expense of $23 million in 2010. 

Cessna Segment Profit (Loss) 

Factors contributing to 2012 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2012, Cessnas segment profit increased $22 million, 37%, compared with 2011, primarily due to the change in mix of Citation jets sold during the period. Improved performance included the following: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Inflation, net of pricing, included a $26 million unfavorable LIFO impact largely due to a $22 million LIFO benefit recorded in 2011. 

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cessnas segment profit increased $89 million in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher volume of $85 million. Segment profit was also impacted by the following contributing factors included within the Other line: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition, cost inflation was offset by a $45 million favorable LIFO benefit discussed above. 

Cessna Backlog 

Cessnas backlog decreased $827 million, 44%, in 2012 and $1.0 billion, 35%, in 2011, mainly attributable to deliveries in excess of new orders and canceled Citation jet orders.

Bell 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bell Revenues and Operating Expenses 

Factors contributing to the 2012 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells revenues increased $749 million, 21%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to higher volume, which included the following factors: 

  ·   $476 million increase in commercial volume, largely related to higher deliveries reflecting our investment in new products and increased focus on commercial markets. Bell delivered 188 commercial aircraft in 2012, compared with 125 aircraft in 2011.   

  ·   $231 million increase in volume related to the V-22 program, primarily reflecting higher deliveries based on schedule requirements and higher revenues related to the support of fielded aircraft. Bell delivered 39 V-22 aircraft in 2012, compared with 34 deliveries in 2011.   

  ·   $21 million increase in other military volume resulting from higher deliveries and services rendered under several programs, partially offset by lower spares and aftermarket volume. Bell delivered 24 H-1 aircraft in 2012, compared with 25 aircraft in 2011.    

Bells operating expenses increased $631 million, 21%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to higher sales volume discussed above. 

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells revenues increased $284 million, 9%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher volume, which included the following factors: 

  ·   $225 million increase in volume related to the V-22 program, primarily reflecting higher deliveries. Bell delivered 34 V-22 aircraft in 2011, compared with 26 deliveries in 2010.   

  ·   $74 million increase in other military volume, primarily reflecting higher H-1 deliveries, with 25 H-1 aircraft delivered in 2011, compared with 18 aircraft in 2010; this increase is net of a $55 million decrease in aftermarket volume, largely due to the completion of several non-recurring programs in 2010.   

  ·   $41 million decrease in commercial volume, primarily reflecting lower deliveries. Bell delivered 125 commercial aircraft in 2011, compared with 131 aircraft in 2010.    

24 

Table of Contents 

Bells operating expenses increased $190 million, 7%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher sales volume discussed above, partially offset by improved cost performance. Improved cost performance was primarily related to our military programs due to efficiencies realized through our production ramp-up as described below. 

Bell Segment Profit 

Factors contributing to 2012 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells segment profit increased $118 million, 23%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to the impact of higher volume in our commercial aircraft and military businesses as described above. Performance reflects higher net research and development expense in 2012 of $26 million due to the ramp-up of new product development and higher selling and administrative expenses largely due to our investment in business system improvement and upgrade activities, which were partially offset by favorable program performance in our military programs, reflecting improved manufacturing efficiencies. 

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Bells segment profit increased $94 million, 22%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to improved program performance of $109 million, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of military and commercial aircraft sold during the period. Bells improved performance included the following: 

  ·   $122 million resulting from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our military programs, resulting from efficiencies realized in connection with the ramp up of production lines.   

  ·   $30 million unfavorable net change in program profit adjustments; this change was largely due to a $21 million adjustment recognized in 2010 related to the recognition of profit on the H-1 and V-22 programs for reimbursement of prior year costs.    

Bell Backlog 

In 2012 and 2011, Bells backlog reflected orders in excess of deliveries resulting in a $123 million, 2%, increase in 2012 and an $873 million, 13%, increase in 2011. 

Textron Systems

Textron Systems Revenues and Operating Expenses 

Factors contributing to the 2012 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues at Textron Systems decreased $135 million, 7%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to lower volume reflecting the following changes: 

· Lower Land & Marine volume of $76 million, primarily related to lower deliveries based on current contract requirements. 

· Lower Mission Support and Other product line volume of $45 million, primarily due to the completion of certain contracts in 2011 and the timing of test and training revenues. 

· Lower Weapons and Sensors volume of $13 million, primarily due to the completion of several contracts in 2011, partially offset by higher international Sensor Fuzed Weapon volume of $67 million. 

Textron Systems operating expenses decreased $126 million, 7%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to the lower volume. Operating expenses for 2012 included $37 million in charges discussed below related to our new UAS fee-for-service contracts, which were offset by the impact of charges at Textron Systems of $60 million during 2011, related to the impairment of intangible assets and severance costs. 

In 2012, we were awarded two indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts with separate U.S. Government customers for UAS fee-for-service activities. In the third quarter of 2012, we experienced start-up issues as we began deployment for the first of these contracts, the MEUAS II program, which required us to augment training procedures, add resources and adjust certain estimated costs. At that time, we took an $18 million charge reflecting our estimated loss on the awarded task orders under both contracts based on our deployment experience, which resulted in changes to certain assumptions, and also reflected higher subcontractor, up-front training and program management costs to support the ramp-up. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we experienced propulsion performance issues with our systems, and as a result, we were not able to perform within our previous cost estimates. Based on the issues we have encountered, we increased our estimate of the costs to complete the awarded task orders under both contracts through completion of those orders and recorded a $19 million unfavorable program profit adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our current financial guidance and backlog do not reflect additional task orders under the MEUAS II IDIQ contract after the current active orders conclude in April 2013. 

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues at Textron Systems decreased $107 million, 5%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to lower volume, reflecting the following changes: 

· Lower UAS volume of $84 million, largely due to lower deliveries and to the timing of revenues from various programs. 

· Lower Mission Support and Other product line volume of $56 million, largely due to the completion of several test and training programs and lower intelligence systems volume. 

· Higher Land & Marine volume of $18 million, primarily related to Armored Security Vehicles. 

· Higher Weapons and Sensors revenues of $10 million, largely due to higher Sensor Fuzed Weapon volume. 

Textron Systems operating expenses decreased $18 million, 1%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to the lower volume, which was partially offset by the $41 million intangible asset impairment charge and $19 million, primarily in severance costs related to the workforce reduction taken in 2011.

Textron Systems Segment Profit 

Factors contributing to 2012 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Segment profit at Textron Systems decreased $9 million, 6%, in 2012, compared with 2011, reflecting the impact of lower volume described above and deliveries on lower margin contracts during the current period. The favorable performance reflects a charge in 2011 of $19 million primarily in severance costs related to workforce reductions, $9 million in lower amortization expense on intangible assets and $8 million in lower net research and development costs, partially offset by the $37 million in charges related to the UAS fee-for-service contracts described above. 

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Segment profit at Textron Systems decreased $89 million, 39%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to the impact of lower volume described above and mix, along with the $41 million intangible asset impairment charge and approximately $19 million in severance costs related to the workforce reduction included in the Other line. 

Textron Systems Backlog 

In 2012, Textron Systems backlog increased $1.6 billion, 118%, largely due to additional orders in the UAS and Land & Marine product lines, including the Canadian TAPV contract for $693 million received in the second quarter of 2012. In 2011, Textron Systems backlog decreased $261 million, reflecting deliveries in excess of new orders related to various military programs.

Industrial Revenues and Operating Expenses 

Factors contributing to the 2012 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

27 

Table of Contents 

Industrial segment revenues increased $115 million, 4%, in 2012, compared with 2011. Higher volume resulted from a $93 million increase in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line, reflecting higher automotive industry demand in North America, and a $78 million increase in the Other Industrial product lines, largely related to higher market demand in the Golf, Turf Care and Light Transportation Vehicles product line. The unfavorable foreign exchange impact was mostly related to the weakening of the euro, which primarily impacted the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line. 

Operating expenses for the Industrial segment increased $102 million, 4%, in 2012, compared with 2011, largely due to $130 million in higher direct material costs in support of higher sales volume. In 2012, operating expenses were also impacted by cost inflation of $44 million, primarily due to higher material and overhead costs, partially offset by lower costs due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of $70 million resulting from the weakening of the euro. 

Factors contributing to the 2011 year-over-year revenue change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Industrial segment revenues increased $261 million, 10%, in 2011 from 2010. Volume increased and mix improved largely due to a $117 million increase in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line, reflecting higher automotive industry demand, and $21 million in the Other Industrial product lines, largely related to the Powered Tools, Testing and Measurement Equipment product line reflecting higher sales in North America and Europe. The favorable foreign exchange impact was primarily related to strengthening of the euro, which mostly impacted the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line. Higher Other Industrial revenues of $78 million included a $27 million impact from acquisitions and improved pricing of $20 million, in addition to the higher volume. 

Operating expenses for the Industrial segment increased $221 million, 9%, in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to a $115 million increase in direct material costs due to higher sales volume, a $68 million impact from foreign exchange related to strengthening of the euro, and $40 million in inflation for direct materials related to various commodity and material components throughout the segment. 

Industrial Segment Profit 

Factors contributing to 2012 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Segment profit for the Industrial segment increased $13 million, 6%, in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to the impact from higher volume as described above, partially offset by cost inflation that exceeded related price increases. 

Factors contributing to 2011 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

28 

Table of Contents 

Industrial segment profit increased $40 million, 25%, in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to a $34 million impact from improved performance and a $31 million impact from higher volume, as described above, partially offset by inflation, net of pricing of $35 million. Performance was favorable for the period due to continued cost reduction activities and improved manufacturing leverage resulting from higher volume. Inflation, net of pricing was primarily due to higher direct material costs for commodity and material components that exceeded related price increases, principally in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line. 

Finance [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our plan to exit the non-captive commercial finance business of our Finance segment has been effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales. We expect to liquidate the majority of the remaining $370 million of finance receivables in the non-captive portfolio over the next two years. 

Finance Revenues 

Finance segment revenues increased $112 million in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily attributable to the following factors: 

  ·   $90 million increase related to the valuation of Golf Mortgage finance receivables held for sale. In 2012, we had $76 million in favorable valuation adjustments compared with unfavorable valuation adjustments of $14 million in 2011.   

  ·   $42 million of lower portfolio losses, net of gains, primarily associated with the Structured Capital and Timeshare portfolios.   

  ·   $25 million increase due to the resolution of one significant Timeshare account that returned to accrual status and was subsequently paid off during the third quarter of 2012.   

  ·   These increases were partially offset by a $61 million decrease attributable to lower average finance receivables of $1.2 billion.    

Finance segment revenues decreased $115 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily attributable to the impact of a $1.8 billion lower average finance receivable balance. 

Finance Segment Profit (Loss) 

Finance segment profit increased $397 million in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to changes in valuation adjustments, lower portfolio losses, net of gains, and the resolution of one significant Timeshare account discussed above, as well as lower administrative expense of $56 million, primarily associated with the exit of the non-captive business. In addition, we recorded a $186 million valuation allowance on the transfer of the Golf Mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification during the fourth quarter of 2011. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million decrease in net interest margin attributable to lower average finance receivables. 

Finance segment loss increased $96 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the $186 million valuation allowance recorded on the transfer of the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio from held for investment to the held for sale classification during the fourth quarter of 2011 and a $61 million reduction in interest margin resulting from the lower average finance receivable balance. These increases were partially offset by $131 million in lower provision for loan losses, primarily the result of a decline in new troubled accounts in the non-captive portfolio during 2011 and a $36 million reversal of the allowance for losses related to one significant account. In addition, administrative expense declined by $44 million primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with a workforce reduction and other cost reductions related to the exit of the non-captive business.

Finance Portfolio Quality 

The following table reflects information about the Finance segments credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Finance receivables held for sale are reflected at the lower of cost or fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not included in the credit performance statistics above. Finance receivables held for sale in the non-captive portfolio totaled $140 million at the end of 2012, compared with $418 million at the end of 2011. 

Nonaccrual finance receivables decreased $178 million, 55%, from 2011, primarily due to reductions of $129 million in the Timeshare portfolio and $38 million in the Captive portfolio. The decrease in the Timeshare portfolio was primarily due to the liquidation of one significant account. The Captive portfolio decreased mostly due to repossession of collateral and cash collections, partially offset by new accounts identified as nonaccrual in 2012. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron Inc. consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Cessna, Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments. The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of TFC, its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by Textron Inc. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage. We believe that with our existing cash and equivalents, along with the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations, we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs.

Textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, up to $200 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit. At December 29, 2012, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility, and there were $37 million of letters of credits issued against it. We also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. 

At December 29, 2012, the principal amount of our convertible notes outstanding was $215 million. Under the terms of the Indenture that governs the notes, the notes are currently convertible at the holders option through April 29, 2013, the second trading day preceding their May 1, 2013 maturity date. We may deliver shares of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes. We intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash. 

Manufacturing Group Cash Flows 

Cash flows from continuing operations for the Manufacturing group as presented in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We generated $958 million in cash from operating activities in 2012 on $1.1 billion in Manufacturing group segment profit and $534 million of Manufacturing group net income. The 26% increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2011 was largely due to lower cash contributions made to our pension plans in 2012. Within working capital, we had a $117 million reduction in cash resulting from an increase in pre-owned inventory in the Cessna segment primarily due to higher trade-in activities, which was largely offset by a reduction in net taxes paid. We made pension contributions of $405 million, $642 million and $417 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased in 2011, compared with 2010, largely due to higher earnings for the Manufacturing group, partially offset by higher cash pension contributions. 

Investing cash flows in 2012, 2011 and 2010 primarily included capital expenditures of $480 million, $423 million, and $270 million, respectively, in support of our new product development and cost improvement strategies. 

We generated cash from financing activities in 2012, largely due to the receipt of $490 million from the Finance group in payment of its intergroup borrowing, partially offset by share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $189 million in payments on our outstanding debt. In 2011, financing activities primarily consisted of $580 million in payments related to the purchase and cancellation of convertible notes and $175 million in intergroup financing for our Finance group, partially offset by $496 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes. In 2010, we repaid $1.2 billion of our bank credit lines. 

Share Repurchases 

In the fourth quarter of 2012, under a 2007 share repurchase authorization, we repurchased 11.1 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $272 million which fully utilized our available repurchase authorization. On January 22, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization program for 25 million shares under which we intend to purchase shares of common stock to offset the impact of dilution from share-based compensation plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes. 

Dividends 

Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $17 million, $22 million and $22 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Capital Contributions Paid To and Dividends Received From the Finance Group 

Under a Support Agreement between Textron Inc. and TFC, Textron Inc. is required to maintain a controlling interest in TFC. The agreement also requires Textron Inc. to ensure that TFC maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than $200 million. Cash contributions paid to TFC to maintain compliance with the Support Agreement and dividends paid by TFC to Textron Inc. are detailed below:

Table of Contents 

Due to the nature of these contributions, we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the Manufacturing group in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Capital contributions to support Finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities. The Finance groups net income (loss) is excluded from the Manufacturing groups cash flows, while dividends from the Finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the Manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment. 

Finance Group Cash Flows 

During 2012, we liquidated $821 million of the Finance groups finance receivables, net of originations. These finance receivable reductions occurred in both the non-captive and captive finance portfolios, but were primarily driven by the non-captive portfolio in connection with our exit plan, including $241 million and $218 million in the Golf Mortgage and Timeshare product lines, respectively. Depending on market conditions, we expect to liquidate the majority of the remaining $370 million of finance receivables in the non-captive portfolio over the next two years. 

The cash flows from continuing operations for the Finance group are summarized below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash flows from operating activities decreased in 2012, primarily due to changes in taxes paid/received, partially offset by higher earnings. Net tax (payments)/refunds were $(43) million, $65 million and $(101) million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net tax payments in 2012 and 2010 included settlements related to the IRSs challenge of tax deductions claimed in prior years for certain leveraged lease transactions. 

Cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations, which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years. Finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales totaled $1.1 billion in 2012, $1.8 billion in 2011 and $3.0 billion in 2010. Cash outflows for originations declined to $331 million in 2012 from $471 million in 2011 and $866 million in 2010. These decreases were largely driven by the wind down of the non-captive business. 

Cash used in financing activities included principal payments on long-term debt of $0.4 billion, $0.8 billion and $2.1 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $106 million, $430 million and $231 million, respectively. In 2012, the Finance group also made cash payments totaling $493 million to the Manufacturing group related to intergroup borrowings. In 2011 and 2010, the Finance group paid $1.4 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, against the outstanding balance on its bank line of credit. 

Consolidated Cash Flows 

The consolidated cash flows from continuing operations, after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups, are summarized below: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash flows from operating activities decreased during 2012 as compared with 2011, as higher earnings were offset by changes in working capital, which included lower net cash receipts from our captive financing activities of $140 million and an increase in pre-owned inventory in the Cessna segment largely due to higher trade-in activities, resulting in a cash reduction of $117 million. Our use of cash for working capital requirements was partially offset by $237 million in lower cash pension contributions made in 2012. 

Cash flow from operating activities increased in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to higher earnings for the Manufacturing group, partially offset by higher cash pension contributions made in 2011. In addition, cash payments related to the restructuring program that we substantially completed at the end of 2010 decreased to $44 million in 2011, from $72 million in 2010.

Cash receipts from the collection of finance receivables continued to outpace finance receivable originations, which resulted in net cash inflow from investing activities for the past three years. Finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales totaled $0.7 billion in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $2.2 billion in 2010. Cash outflows for originations declined to $22 million in 2012 from $187 million in 2011 and $450 million in 2010. These decreases are largely due to our ongoing exit from the non-captive business. Investing activities also included capital expenditures of $480 million, $423 million, and $270 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in support of our new product development and cost improvement strategies. 

Cash used in financing activities included principal payments on long-term debt of $0.6 billion, $0.8 billion and $2.2 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011 and 2010, financing activities also included repayments of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, against the outstanding balance on our bank credit lines. Cash used in financing activities also included $272 million of share repurchases in 2012 and $580 million in payments related to the purchase of convertible notes in 2011. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $106 million, $926 million and $231 million, respectively. 

Captive Financing and Other Intercompany Transactions 

The Finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the Finance groups statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing groups statement of cash flows, the cash received from the Finance group on the customers behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below:

Contractual Obligations 

Manufacturing Group 

The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Manufacturing group as of December 29, 2012: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) We maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. Our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table. In 2013, we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $160 million and approximately $22 million in the Retirement Account Plan. Based on our current assumptions, which may change with changes in market conditions, our current contribution estimates for each of the years from 2014 through 2017 are estimated to be in the range of approximately $100 million to $200 million under the plan provisions in place at this time. 

(2) Other long-term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2012, representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. The timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. Other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments. 

(3) Operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases. 

(4) Purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. Approximately 40% of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. Government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

Finance Group 

The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Finance group as of December 29, 2012: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Securitized debt payments do not represent contractual obligations of the Finance group, and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests. 

(2) Interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt. They do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates, which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt. 

At December 29, 2012, the Finance group also had $75 million in other liabilities, primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses, that are payable within the next 12 months. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes other significant accounting policies. 

Long-Term Contracts 

We make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long-term contracts. These contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed-price purchase options for additional products. We account for these long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases, includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years. We are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, product performance, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries, technical requirements, or schedule. 

Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.

Table of Contents 

At the outset of each contract, we estimate the initial profit booking rate. The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract. Likewise, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate. When adjustments are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period. 

The following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the three years ended December 29, 2012: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Goodwill 

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired. The reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit. In certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics. 

For the Bell reporting unit, we performed a qualitative assessment based on economic, industry and company-specific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the units fair value is greater than its carrying amount and the next step of the impairment analysis was not required. For our other reporting units, we performed the next step of the impairment analysis, which required us to calculate fair value of each reporting unit. 

Fair values were established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporated assumptions for short- and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates, which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. The revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. These plans do not include any potential impact that sequestration budget cuts may have on our businesses that serve the U.S. Government. The long-term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. We utilize a weighted-average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. 

If the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit is not impaired, and no further analysis is performed. Otherwise, the amount of the impairment must be determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

Based on our annual impairment reviews, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future.

Retirement Benefits 

We maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases. We evaluate and update these assumptions annually. 

To determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2012, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.58%, compared with 7.84% in 2011. In 2012 and 2011, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 90% of our total pension assets, was 7.75% and 8.00%, respectively. A 50-basis-point decrease in this long-term rate of return in 2012 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately $24 million. 

The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In 2012, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 4.94%, compared with 5.71% in 2011. For our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 5.00% in 2012, compared with 5.75% for 2011. A 50-basis-point decrease in this discount rate in 2012 would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately $27 million. 

The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2012 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. The 2012 medical rate of 8.40% is assumed to decrease to 5.00% by 2021 and then remain at that level. The 2012 prescription drug rate of 8.40% is assumed to decrease to 5.00% by 2021 and then remain at that level. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of a one-percentage-point change in the cost trend rate. 

Warranty Liabilities 

We provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs, including parts and labor, for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years. A significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses. We also may incur costs related to product recalls. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold, historical costs per claim, contractual recoveries from vendors, and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, including production and warranty patterns for new models. During our initial aircraft model launches, we typically incur higher warranty-related costs until the production process matures, at which point warranty costs moderate. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant. Should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience, we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required. 

Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables Held for Investment 

Finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses. We maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on managements evaluation. For larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired, including large accounts in homogeneous portfolios, a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value with either a) the expected future cash flows, discounted at the finance receivables effective interest rate; or b) the fair value of the underlying collateral, if the finance receivable is collateral dependent. The expected future cash flows consider collateral value; financial performance and liquidity of our borrower; existence and financial strength of guarantors; estimated recovery costs, including legal expenses; and costs associated with the repossession/foreclosure and eventual disposal of collateral. When there is a range of potential outcomes, we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence. The evaluation of our portfolio is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral, which may differ from actual results. While our analysis is specific to each individual account, critical factors included in this analysis for the Captive product line include industry valuation guides, age and physical condition of collateral, payment history and existence and financial strength of guarantors. 

37 

Table of Contents 

We also establish an allowance for losses to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio. For the Captive product line, the allowance is established as a percentage of non-recourse finance receivables, which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves. The percentage is based on a combination of factors, including historical loss experience, current delinquency and default trends, collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years, available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. We recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense. 

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Interest and penalties are accrued, where applicable. We recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense. If we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis.
