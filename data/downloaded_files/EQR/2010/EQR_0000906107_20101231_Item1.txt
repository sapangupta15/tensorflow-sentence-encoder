PART I   

  Item 1.    Business    

 General  

 Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.  

 The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices in each of its markets.  

 EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2010 owned an approximate 95.5% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). All of EQRs property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the Company include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.  

 As of December 31, 2010, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 451 properties located in 17 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 129,604 apartment units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):

 Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies  

 The Company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital.  

 Our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. Revenue is maximized by driving qualified resident prospects to our properties, converting this traffic cost-effectively into new leases at the highest rent possible, keeping our residents satisfied and renewing their leases at yet higher rents. While we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is our customer service that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends.  

 We use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. Many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to review their account and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line.  

 4   
 We seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation. These markets generally feature one or more of the following:  

    n   High barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is difficult or costly to build new apartment properties leading to low supply;    

    n   High single family home prices making our apartments a more economical housing choice;    

    n   Strong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth, which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments; and    

    n   An attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention and allowing us to more readily increase rents.     

 Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (OP Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities. The Company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings. The Company has also, in the past, converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business.  

 The Company primarily sources the funds for its new property acquisitions in its core markets with the sales proceeds from selling assets that are older or located in non-core markets. During the last five years, the Company has sold over 97,000 apartment units for an aggregate sales price of $7.2 billion and acquired nearly 25,000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately $5.5 billion. We are currently acquiring and developing assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas: Boston, New York, Washington DC, South Florida, Southern California, San Francisco, Seattle and to a lesser extent Denver. We also have investments (in the aggregate about 18% of our NOI) in other markets including Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon, New England excluding Boston, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville but do not intend to acquire or develop assets in these markets.  

 As part of its strategy, the Company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially unoccupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed. We intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets. Currently, no single metropolitan area accounts for more than 17% of our NOI, though no guarantee can be made that NOI concentration may not increase in the future.  

 We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. We provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites. We actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. We monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores.  

 We have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. With its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. Our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation. When developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. We continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting and HVAC improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption.

 Credit Facilities  

 The Operating Partnership has a $1.425 billion (net of $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not available for borrowing) unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.50%) dependent upon the Operating Partnerships credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnerships credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.  

 As of December 31, 2010, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.28 billion (net of $147.3 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above) and there was no amount outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate was 0.66%. As of December 31, 2009, the amount available on the credit facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). The Company did not draw and had no balance outstanding on its revolving credit facility at any time during the year ended December 31, 2009.  

 Competition  

 All of the Companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Companys ability to lease apartment units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Companys managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to competition.
