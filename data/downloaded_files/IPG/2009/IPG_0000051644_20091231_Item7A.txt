Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

(Amounts in millions)  

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. From time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.  

Interest Rates  

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations as the majority of our debt (approximately 84% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008) bears interest at fixed rates. We do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. The fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a change in interest rates is summarized below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We enter into interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Changes in interest rates could affect the amount recorded to our Consolidated Financial Statements related to interest rate swap agreements. In the third quarter of 2009, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $250.0 notional amount of our $350.0 2014 Notes from fixed rate to floating rate debt. We recognize changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements as well as changes in fair value of the underlying debt within other income, net and as a result we recorded a net gain of $0.1 for the year ended December 31, 2009. In February 2010 we terminated all of our interest rate swaps. See Note 2 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

We have $2,506.1 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2009, which are subject to changes in interest rates, and we generally invest these assets in conservative, short-term investment-grade securities with financial institutions. The interest income we obtain from these investments are subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. During 2009, due to significant declines in foreign interest rates, and to a lesser extent, domestic interest rates, our interest income decreased when compared to 2008. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would impact our interest income by approximately $25.0. This assumes that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end levels.  

Foreign Currencies  

We are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Since we report revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign operations. The primary currency exchanges that we have exposure to in 2009 are the Euro, Pound Sterling, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and Chinese Yuan Renminbi. Based on 2009 exchange rates and operating results, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease between 1% and 3%. This assumes that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant from current levels. The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholdersÂ’ equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay

 expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. However, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. Currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. We have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  

We monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. A currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. If this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. Our Venezuela agencies will transition to inflationary accounting on January 1, 2010, and we will be recording a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the significant devaluation that occurred to the official rate in January 2010. This will be recorded in income before income taxes within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Going forward, we will be re-measuring our local non-monetary transactions, assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 4.3 Venezuelan Bolivars Fuertes per U.S. dollar. Although this devaluation will result in a reduction in the U.S. dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses, we do not have significant operations in Venezuela and, subsequent to our foreign exchange translation loss on devaluation noted above, we do not expect this to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.  

Credit and Market Risks  

Certain balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. We invest our excess cash in investment-grade, short-term securities with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable.  

Our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. The fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year and can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods.
