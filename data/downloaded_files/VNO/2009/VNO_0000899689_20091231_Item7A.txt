ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2009, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $507,750,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.49% was subject to LIBOR caps. These caps are based on a notional amount of $507,750,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.39%.  

As of December 31, 2009, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $203,286,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. 

Fair Value of Our Debt 

The estimated fair value of our debt at December 31, 2009 was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $501,467,000 based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current interest rates at which we believe similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.
