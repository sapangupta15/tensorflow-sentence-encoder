ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Background

Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, we operate an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries. We have hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2017, approximately 200 million passengers boarded our flights.

Strategic Objectives

We are focused on four long-term strategic objectives: Create a World-Class Customer Experience, Make Culture a Competitive Advantage, Ensure Long-Term Financial Strength and Think Forward, Lead Forward.

Create a World-Class Customer Experience

We began 2017 by being named Air Transport World’s Airline of the Year in recognition of our successful integration and the significant investments we made in our product and people. Also in 2017, we:

•Recorded our best on-time departure and arrival performance since 2003, and our best baggage handling performance since the DOT began reporting this information in 1994.

•Operated the youngest fleet among the major U.S. network carriers and invested $4.1 billion in new aircraft.

•Introduced new streaming-capable, satellite-based internet access on our Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which will be rolled out across most of our domestic mainline fleet.

•Introduced Basic Economy, a product to compete with ultra low-cost carriers, which is now offered nationwide and to leisure markets in Mexico and most of the Caribbean.

•Commenced our roll out of Premium Economy, which offers a wider seat, more legroom, an amenity kit and enhanced meal choices on international flights.

•Expanded a number of our lounges by opening Flagship First Dining, a new exclusive experience for customers in First Class on international and A321T transcontinental flights, which we now offer in our Miami, Los Angeles and New York-JFK lounges.

Make Culture a Competitive Advantage

We are creating an environment that cares for frontline team members, provides competitive pay and equips our team with the right tools to support our customers. During 2017, we:

•Kept team member pay competitive through initiatives such as a mid-contract salary increase for pilots and flight attendants and continued step increases from a mid-contract pay increase for mechanics and fleet service workers.

•Invested more than $300 million in facilities and equipment, including renovations to team member spaces, mobile devices for pilots and flight attendants, and the ongoing One Campus One Team initiative at our global support center in Fort Worth, Texas.

•Provided customer service instruction to approximately 35,000 team members through “Elevate the Everyday Experience” training and launched training for leaders that emphasizes supporting team members who directly serve customers.

•Announced that work on our CFM56-5B engines, which power much of our Airbus narrowbody fleet, will move in-house to our maintenance facility located in Tulsa, Oklahoma beginning later in 2018.

•Shared the benefits of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by issuing $1,000 payments to all non-officer team members at American and its wholly-owned regional carriers. While we do not yet pay federal cash income taxes, we believe the new tax law will reduce our future tax bill and allow more investments in equipment and facilities.

45

Ensure Long-Term Financial Strength

We are focused on capturing efficiencies created by our merger, delivering on our earnings potential and creating value for our stockholders. During 2017, we:

•Returned $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $198 million and the repurchase of $1.6 billion of common stock, or 33.9 million shares. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have returned $11.4 billion to stockholders, including $835 million in quarterly dividend payments and $10.6 billion in share repurchases, or 262.3 million shares. In January 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share dividend for stockholders of record on February 6, 2018, and payable on February 20, 2018.

•Completed several transactions that provided efficient financing. See discussion within “Liquidity” below for more information.

•Announced revenue and cost initiatives to improve the customer experience, drive revenue improvements and deliver cost efficiencies.

Think Forward, Lead Forward

We are committed to re-establishing ourselves as an industry leader by creating an action-oriented culture that moves quickly to bring products to market, embraces technological change and quickly seizes upon new opportunities for our network and our product. During 2017, we:

•Acquired 2.7% of the outstanding shares of China Southern Airlines, the largest airline in China.

•Executed a new Trans-Atlantic joint business agreement that extends the term of our prior Trans-Atlantic joint business agreement.

•Announced a commitment for more than $1.6 billion for improvements of LAX Terminals 4 and 5, setting the stage for us to receive additional gate space and strengthen our Pacific gateway.

•Built a five-gate expansion at ORD Terminal 3, which is expected to open in April 2018.

2017 Financial Overview

The U.S. Airline Industry

The industry remained profitable in 2017. Despite an improving economy and strong demand environment, year-over-year revenue results by carrier were varied. This was in part due to competitive pricing actions and the effects of competitive capacity growth in certain markets, as well as the three major hurricanes that negatively impacted commercial flights in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean islands and Puerto Rico. With respect to fuel costs, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel, which jet fuel prices tend to follow, was on average approximately 23% higher in 2017 as compared to 2016. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during 2017 was $54 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $44 per barrel during 2016. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during 2017 between a high of $67 per barrel to a low of $44 per barrel, and closed the year on December 31, 2017 at $67 per barrel. Brent crude oil prices were higher in 2017 due principally to reductions of global inventories driven by strong demand and continued production restraint. Jet fuel prices during 2017 were also impacted by hurricane disruptions and increased refinery costs.

See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business,” “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity” and “Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.”

AAG’s 2017 Results

The selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) See Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Note 2 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of special items.

Pre-Tax Income and Net Income

Pre-tax income and net income were $3.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2017, respectively. This compares to 2016 pre-tax income and net income of $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax special items, we recognized pre-tax income of $3.8 billion in 2017 as compared to $5.1 billion in 2016. The year-over-year declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates. Fuel costs increased driven by a 21.4% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel. Wage rates were higher primarily due to mid-contract pay increases for pilots and flight attendants effective in the second quarter of 2017, as well as increases for maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. These increases were offset in part by higher revenues.

Revenue

In 2017, we reported total operating revenues of $42.2 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion, or 5.0%, as compared to 2016. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $36.1 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 4.5%, as compared to 2016. The increase in mainline and regional passenger revenues was due to a 3.2% year-over-year increase in consolidated yields driven by strong demand. Domestic consolidated yields increased 3.5% and international yields rose 3.2%, due principally to improved performance in Latin America.

Additionally, other revenues increased $373 million primarily due to higher revenues associated with our loyalty program. Our mainline and regional total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 15.27 cents in 2017, a 3.9% increase as compared to 14.70 cents in 2016.

Fuel

Our mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $7.5 billion in 2017, which was $1.3 billion, or 21.5%, higher as compared to 2016. This increase was driven by a 21.4% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.73 in 2017 from $1.42 in 2016.

47

As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.

Other Costs

We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.

Our 2017 mainline CASM was 12.96 cents, an increase of 8.6%, from 11.94 cents in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher fuel costs and higher wage rates due to the mid-contract pay increases described above.

Our 2017 mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel was 10.16 cents, an increase of 6.4%, from 9.54 cents in 2016, which was also driven by higher wage rates as described above.

For a reconciliation of mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Income Taxes

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $10.0 billion of federal NOLs and $3.4 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which we expect to be available in 2018 to reduce future federal and state taxable income. While we currently do not pay federal cash income taxes, we believe the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Act represents a significant benefit for us and our stockholders. Commencing in 2018, our effective tax rate has been reduced from approximately 38% to approximately 24%, which will significantly reduce our federal tax liability when we do become a cash tax payer. In addition, we presently expect to receive cash tax refunds of approximately $170 million in both 2019 and 2020 due to the repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $5.1 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and $2.5 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. We also had restricted cash and short-term investments of $318 million. As described above, in connection with our strategic objective “Ensure Long-Term Financial Strength,” we completed several transactions during 2017 to ensure our long-term competitiveness. During 2017, we:

•Repriced $4.9 billion of our term loans at lower rates and extended and increased our revolving credit facilities.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Raised approximately $853 million in net proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions.

See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on our debt obligations.

Results of Operations – 2017 Compared to 2016

Pre-tax income and net income were $3.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2017, respectively. This compares to 2016 pre-tax income and net income of $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $3.8 billion and $5.1 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data –“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

The year-over-year declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates.

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

This table presents our total passenger revenues and the year-over-year change in certain operating statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total passenger revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 4.5%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to a 3.2% year-over-year increase in consolidated passenger yields driven by strong demand. Domestic consolidated yields increased 3.5% and international yields rose 3.2%, due principally to improved performance in Latin America.

Cargo revenue increased $100 million, or 14.3%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily driven by an increase in freight volume.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $373 million, or 7.6%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily driven by higher revenues associated with our loyalty program. In 2017 and 2016, loyalty program revenue was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Of this, $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments, respectively.

Total operating revenues in 2017 increased $2.0 billion, or 5.0%, from 2016 driven principally by a 4.5% increase in total passenger revenues as described above. Our TRASM was 15.27 cents in 2017, a 3.9% increase as compared to 14.70 cents in 2016.

50

Mainline Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mainline operating expenses increased $2.8 billion, or 9.5%, in 2017 from 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in mainline CASM.

Mainline CASM

We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.

The table below presents the reconciliation of mainline operating expenses (GAAP measure) to mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.

51

The major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding):

52

Operating Special Items, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Merger integration expenses included costs related to information technology, professional fees, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities and training, and in 2016, also included costs related to alignment of labor union contracts and the launch of re-branded uniforms, both of which drove the $241 million year-over-year decrease in these expenses.

(2) Fleet restructuring expenses, driven in part by the Merger, principally included the acceleration of depreciation and impairments for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.

(3) Employee bonus expense included costs related to the $1,000 cash bonus and associated payroll taxes granted to mainline employees as of December 31, 2017 in recognition of the 2017 Tax Act.

(4) Labor contract expenses primarily included one-time charges to adjust the vacation accruals for pilots and flight attendants as a result of the mid-contract pay rate adjustments effective in the second quarter of 2017.

Regional Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Regional operating expenses increased $502 million, or 8.3%, in 2017 from 2016. The year-over-year increase was due in part to a $273 million, or 24.6%, increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of fuel increased 21.2% to $1.79 in 2017 from $1.48 in 2016, on a 2.8% increase in consumption. Additionally, other regional operating expenses increased $229 million, or 4.6%, primarily driven by a 3.2% increase in capacity, principally from our wholly-owned regional carriers. See Note 1(q) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on regional expenses.

53

Nonoperating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided relatively nominal returns. Interest income increased $31 million, or 47.8%, principally due to a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2017 as compared to 2016.

Interest expense, net increased $62 million, or 6.2%, in 2017 primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with our fleet renewal program.

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2017 and 2016 included $22 million and $49 million, respectively, of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.

Income Taxes

In 2017 and 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, at an effective rate of approximately 38%. This tax provision was substantially non-cash due to utilization of our NOLs. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $10.0 billion of federal NOLs and $3.4 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which we expect to be available in 2018 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.

As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a special, non-cash tax benefit of $7 million in 2017 to reflect the impact of lower corporate income tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. For 2018, we presently expect to recognize a provision for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 24% due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate.

See Note 6 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.

Results of Operations – 2016 Compared to 2015 

We realized net income of $2.7 billion in 2016. This compares to $7.6 billion of net income in 2015, which included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit as we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, we recorded a $1.6 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax provision and net income are not comparable to 2015.

We realized pre-tax income of $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $5.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data –“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Our 2016 pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were higher in 2016, driven by our new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.

54

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

This table presents our total passenger revenues and the year-over-year change in certain operating statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total passenger revenues declined $933 million, or 2.6%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by a 2.8% decrease in consolidated passenger yields due to competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness.

Cargo revenue decreased $60 million, or 7.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven primarily by a decrease in domestic and international freight yields.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $183 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by higher revenues associated with our loyalty program. In 2016 and 2015, loyalty program revenue was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Of this, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments, respectively.

Total operating revenues in 2016 decreased $810 million, or 2.0%, from 2015 driven by lower passenger revenues offset in part by higher other revenue as described above. Our TRASM was 14.70 cents in 2016, a 3.7% decrease as compared to 15.25 cents in 2015.

55

Mainline Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mainline operating expenses increased $49 million, or 0.2%, in 2016 from 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher wage rates resulting from new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these costs were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in mainline CASM.

Mainline CASM

We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.

Management uses mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.

56

The major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Significant changes in the components of mainline CASM are as follows:

•Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 19.3% primarily due to an 18.2% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.41 in 2016 from $1.72 in 2015.

•Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 13.2% primarily due to increased costs associated with new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program.

•Selling expenses per ASM decreased 6.0% primarily due to lower credit card and booking fees.

•Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 10.7% primarily due to depreciation related to aircraft purchased in connection with our fleet renewal program. In 2016, we took delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft.

57

Operating Special Items, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Merger integration expenses included costs related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, relocation and training, and, in 2015, also included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015.

(2) Fleet restructuring expenses, driven in part by the Merger, principally included the acceleration of depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.

Regional Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Regional operating expenses increased $61 million, or 1.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The year-over-year increase was due in part to a $182 million, or 3.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The increase in other regional operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in capacity, principally from our wholly-owned regional carriers. Offsetting this increase was a $121 million, or 9.8%, decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was driven primarily by a 14.5% decline in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.48 in 2016 from $1.73 in 2015, offset in part by a 5.5% increase in consumption. See Note 1(q) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on regional expenses.

Nonoperating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $24 million, or 60.9%, principally due to a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2016 as compared to 2015.

58

Interest expense, net increased in 2016 primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with our fleet renewal program.

In 2016, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $49 million of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.

In 2015, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. We also incurred $159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.

Income Taxes

In 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $1.6 billion at an effective rate of approximately 38%, which was substantially non-cash due to our utilization of NOLs. Substantially all of our income before income taxes was attributable to the United States.

In 2015, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.

See Note 6 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.

American’s Results of Operations

Results of Operations – 2017 Compared to 2016 

American realized pre-tax income of $3.2 billion and net income of $1.9 billion in 2017. This compares to 2016 pre-tax income of $4.4 billion and net income of $2.8 billion.

The year-over-year decline in American’s pre-tax income was principally driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates.

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total passenger revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 4.5%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to a year-over-year increase in consolidated passenger yields driven by strong demand.

Cargo revenue increased $100 million, or 14.3%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily driven by an increase in freight volume.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with American’s loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $378 million, or 7.7%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily driven by higher revenues associated with American’s loyalty program. In 2017 and 2016, loyalty program revenue was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Of this, $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments, respectively.

Total operating revenues in 2017 increased $2.0 billion, or 5.1%, from 2016 driven principally by a 4.5% increase in total passenger revenues as described above.

(3) Employee bonus expense included costs related to the $1,000 cash bonus and associated payroll taxes granted to mainline employees as of December 31, 2017 in recognition of the 2017 Tax Act.

(4) Labor contract expenses primarily included one-time charges to adjust the vacation accruals for pilots and flight attendants as a result of the mid-contract pay rate adjustments effective in the second quarter of 2017.

Regional Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Regional operating expenses increased $563 million, or 9.4%, in 2017 from 2016. The year-over-year increase was due in part to a $273 million, or 24.6%, increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of fuel increased 21.2% to $1.79 in 2017 from $1.48 in 2016, on a 2.8% increase in consumption. Additionally, other regional operating expenses increased $290 million, or 5.9%, primarily driven by increased capacity. See Note 1(q) to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on regional expenses.

Nonoperating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Not meaningful.

American’s short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided relatively nominal returns. Interest income increased $111 million due to higher interest-bearing related party receivables from American’s parent company, AAG, as well as a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2017 as compared to 2016.

Interest expense, net increased $82 million, or 9.1%, in 2017 primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with American’s fleet renewal program.

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2017 and 2016 included $22 million and $49 million, respectively, of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.

Income Taxes

American is part of the AAG consolidated income tax return.

In 2017 and 2016, American recorded an income tax provision of $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, at an effective rate of approximately 41% and 37%, respectively. This tax provision was substantially non-cash due to utilization of American’s NOLs. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2017, American had approximately $10.6 billion of federal NOLs and $3.2 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which American expects to be available in 2018 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.

As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, American recorded a special, non-cash tax provision of $93 million in 2017 to reflect the impact of lower corporate income tax rates on its deferred tax assets and liabilities. For 2018, American presently expects to recognize a provision for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 24% due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate.

See Note 4 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.

Results of Operations – 2016 Compared to 2015 

American realized net income of $2.8 billion in 2016. This compares to $8.1 billion of net income in 2015, which included a special $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit as American reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which include its federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, American recorded a $1.7 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax provision and net income are not comparable to 2015.

American realized pre-tax income of $4.4 billion and $4.7 billion in 2016 and 2015 respectively. American’s 2016 pre-tax income was impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were higher in 2016, driven by American’s new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.

62

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total passenger revenues declined $933 million, or 2.6%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by a decrease in consolidated passenger yields due to competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness.

Cargo revenue decreased $60 million, or 7.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven primarily by a decrease in domestic and international freight yields.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with American’s loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $218 million, or 4.7%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by higher revenues associated with American’s loyalty program. In 2016 and 2015, loyalty program revenue was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Of this, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments, respectively.

Total operating revenues in 2016 decreased $775 million, or 1.9%, from 2015 driven by lower passenger revenues offset in part by higher other revenue as described above.

Mainline Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mainline operating expenses increased $53 million, or 0.2%, in 2016 from 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher wage rates resulting from new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these costs were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expenses are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Special Items, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Merger integration expenses included costs related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, relocation and training, and, in 2015, also included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015.

(2) Fleet restructuring expenses, driven in part by the Merger, principally included the acceleration of depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.

Regional Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Regional operating expenses increased $57 million, or 1.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The year-over-year increase was due in part to a $178 million, or 3.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The increase in other regional operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in capacity. Offsetting this increase was a $121 million, or 9.8%, decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was driven primarily by a 14.5% decline in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.48 in 2016 from $1.73 in 2015, offset in part by a 5.5% increase in consumption. See Note 1(q) to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on regional expenses.

64

Nonoperating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

American’s short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $55 million due to higher interest-bearing related party receivables from American’s parent company, AAG, as well as a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Interest expense, net increased in 2016 primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with American’s fleet renewal program.

In 2016, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $49 million of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.

In 2015, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. American also incurred $159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.

Income Taxes

American is part of the AAG consolidated income tax return.

In 2016, American recorded an income tax provision of $1.7 billion at an effective rate of approximately 37%, which was substantially non-cash due to American’s utilization of NOLs. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes was attributable to the United States.

In 2015, American reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in American’s consolidated statement of operations.

See Note 4 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2017, AAG had approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity and $318 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail of our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):

Share Repurchase Programs

Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved six share repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority. As of December 31, 2017, $450 million remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and our repurchase of common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 33.9 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.6 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $45.68. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014 through December 31, 2017, we have repurchased 262.3 million shares of AAG common stock for $10.6 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $40.22.

Cash Dividends

Our Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during 2017:

We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

Sources and Uses of Cash

AAG

2017 Compared to 2016 

Operating Activities

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion and $6.5 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $1.8 billion. This decrease in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to lower profitability in 2017 driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates, which were offset in part by higher revenues.

Investing Activities

Our net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion and $5.7 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Our principal investing activities in 2017 included expenditures of $6.0 billion for property and equipment, including 20 Airbus A321 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Embraer E175 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 Family aircraft and four Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft. We also made a $203 million equity investment in China Southern Airlines. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.3 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $947 million of net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily representing cash proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, and a $319 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments.

Our principal investing activities in 2016 included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, including 25 Airbus A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer E175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft.

These cash inflows were offset in part by $4.5 billion in share repurchases, $3.8 billion in debt repayments, including the repayment of $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-1 term loans, respectively, and $224 million in dividend payments.

2016 Compared to 2015

Operating Activities

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 billion and $6.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. While AAG’s profitability was lower in 2016 as compared to 2015, cash provided by operating activities increased $275 million driven by certain payments received related to our co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016.

Investing Activities

Our net cash used in investing activities was $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our principal investing activities in 2016 included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, including 25 Airbus A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer E175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft.

American

2017 Compared to 2016

Operating Activities

American’s net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $1.1 billion. AAG has the ability to move funds freely between its subsidiaries to support its cash requirements. The increase in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in intercompany cash transfers from American to AAG. This increase in operating cash flows was offset in part by lower profitability in 2017 driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates, which were offset in part by higher revenues.

Investing Activities

American’s net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion and $5.6 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

American’s principal investing activities in 2017 included expenditures of $5.9 billion for property and equipment, including 20 Airbus A321 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Embraer E175 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 Family aircraft and four Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft. American also made a $203 million equity investment in China Southern Airlines. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.3 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $922 million of net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily representing cash proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, and a $319 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments.

American’s principal investing activities in 2016 included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, including 25 Airbus A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer E175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft.

Financing Activities

American’s net cash provided by financing activities was $668 million and $3.8 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

American’s principal financing activities in 2017 included net proceeds of $3.1 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.0 billion of EETCs and $1.0 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $2.3 billion in debt repayments.

American’s principal financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds of $7.7 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.8 billion of EETCs, $2.3 billion provided under the April 2016 and December 2016 Term Loan Facilities and $1.8 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $3.8 billion in debt repayments, including the repayment of $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-1 term loans, respectively.

2016 Compared to 2015 

Operating Activities

American’s net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $837 million. AAG has the ability to move funds freely between its subsidiaries to support its cash requirements. The decline in American’s operating cash flows from 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to intercompany transfers of cash from American to AAG in order to fund higher share repurchases in 2016. Additionally, in 2015, American’s operating cash flows included the proceeds from the $500 million issuance of AAG’s 4.625% senior notes, which also contributed to the year-over-year decline in operating cash flows. These declines were offset in part by certain payments received related to American’s co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016.

Investing Activities

American’s net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion in each of 2016 and 2015.

American’s principal investing activities in 2016 included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, including 25 Airbus A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer E175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft.

American’s principal investing activities in 2015 included expenditures of $6.1 billion for property and equipment, including 38 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 24 Embraer E175 aircraft, 20 Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13

Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft and the purchase of five Boeing 757 aircraft previously being leased. These cash outflows were offset in part by $391 million in net sales of short-term investments.

Financing Activities

American’s net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

American’s principal financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds of $7.7 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.8 billion of EETCs, $2.3 billion provided under the April 2016 and December 2016 Term Loan Facilities and $1.8 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $3.8 billion in debt repayments, including the repayment of $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-1 term loans, respectively.

American’s principal financing activities in 2015 included net proceeds of $4.5 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.3 billion of EETCs and $1.9 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $2.2 billion in debt repayments, including the $400 million repayment of the AAdvantage loan with Citibank.

Collateral-Related Covenants

Certain of our debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to appraise the related collateral annually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the collateral coverage tests for the 2013 Credit Facilities, the 2014 Credit Facilities, the April 2016 Credit Facilities and the December 2016 Credit Facilities as of the most recent measurement dates. For further information regarding our collateral-related covenants, see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

Credit Ratings

The following table details AAG and American’s credit ratings as of December 31, 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) This rating is for AAG only. The credit agency does not rate this category for American.

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.

Commitments

For further information regarding our commitments, see the Notes to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and the Notes to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 9 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

Pass-Through Trusts

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with EETCs, issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.

Each trust covers a set number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2017, $11.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft’s fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future obligations to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $572 million as of December 31, 2017.

Letters of Credit and Other

We provide financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or restricted cash and investments, to primarily support projected workers’ compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December 31, 2017, we had $448 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations, of which $88 million is collateralized with our restricted cash. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2022.

Contractual Obligations

The following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.

(a) For additional information, see the Notes to AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B referenced in the table above.

(b) Amounts represent contractual amounts due. Excludes $227 million and $236 million of unamortized debt discount, premium and issuance costs as of December 31, 2017 for American and AAG, respectively.

(c) For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at December 31, 2017.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e) See Part I, Item 2. Properties – “Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments” for additional information about the firm commitment aircraft delivery schedule.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(g) Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially.

71

(h) Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and is based on estimated payments through 2027. The total expected pension contribution of $467 million in 2018 assumes a supplemental contribution of $425 million in addition to the $42 million minimum required contribution.

(i) Includes purchase commitments for jet fuel, facility construction projects and information technology support.

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions

In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft, the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, and future pension funding obligations, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.

In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.

Our Board of Directors has from time to time authorized programs to repurchase shares of our common stock, one of which is currently in effect, and may authorize additional share repurchase programs in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.

Passenger Revenue

Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns. Our air traffic liability was $4.0 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition 

72

and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and other airline industry participants have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed.

Loyalty Program

We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American or other participating partner airlines.

Through December 31, 2017, we used the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our loyalty program liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits, even mileage credits for members whose account balances have not yet reached the minimum level required to redeem an award. Mileage credits are subject to expiration. The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The estimated incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These costs and estimates are based on our historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of passenger revenue.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the liability for outstanding mileage credits accounted for under the incremental cost method was $677 million and $669 million, respectively, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability.

A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the liability. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have an approximate $38 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2017. A 10% increase or decrease in the assumed price per gallon of fuel would have an approximate $11 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2017.

We also sell loyalty program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We account for mileage sales under our agreements with non-airline business partners in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) –Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” In accordance with ASU 2009-13, we allocate the consideration received from the sale of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.

As a result of our co-branded credit card program agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US that we entered into in 2016, we identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of the American brand including access to loyalty program member lists, advertising and other travel related benefits (collectively, the marketing component).

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and is amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $2.1 billion in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits recorded within loyalty program liability on our consolidated balance sheets.

A change to certain estimates used in the allocation of consideration received from the sale of mileage credits could have a material impact on the liability. A 10% increase or decrease in the relative selling price of the transportation component would have an approximate $87 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2017.

73

The services under the marketing component are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments included in other revenues was approximately $2.2 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2018, we are adopting ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). See Recent Accounting Pronouncements below for further discussion.

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment, as well as other fixed assets and finite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, tradenames and airport gate leasehold rights. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Finite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.

We assess impairment on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

The majority of American’s fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain domestic airport slots at our hubs and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors, among others, to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining per mile passenger yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.

Based upon our annual assessment, there were no impairments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in 2017.

Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits

We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1) discount rate; (2) expected return on plan assets; (3) expected health care cost trend rate and (4) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2017 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.3 billion and $46 million, respectively, and increase both estimated 2018 pension expense and estimated 2018 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by less than $1 million.

(2) The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 30% U.S. stocks, 22% developed international stocks, 20% long duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds, 20% alternative (private) investments and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2017 would increase estimated 2018 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $57 million and $1 million, respectively.

(3) The assumed health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2018 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by $5 million.

During 2017, we reviewed and revised certain economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates and health care cost and trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $1.2 billion in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in an increase of $45 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017. We also revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans of $114 million and $8 million, respectively.

See Note 9 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.

We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our assessment of future profitability, including conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand.

In connection with the preparation of our financial statements at the end of 2015, we determined that after considering all positive and negative evidence, including the completion of certain critical Merger integration milestones as well as our financial performance, it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred income tax assets, which include our NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Standards Effective for 2018 Reporting Periods

Effective January 1, 2018, we are adopting the accounting pronouncements described below. The adoption and related required disclosures will be reported in our first quarter 2018 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (the New Revenue Standard)

The New Revenue Standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. We are adopting the New Revenue Standard using the full retrospective method, which results in the recast of each prior reporting period presented.

The adoption of the New Revenue Standard will impact our accounting for outstanding mileage credits earned through travel by AAdvantage loyalty program members. There is no change in accounting for sales of mileage credits to co-branded card or other partners as those are currently reported in accordance with the New Revenue Standard. Through December 31, 2017, we used the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our loyalty program liability related to mileage credits earned through travel, which were valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger (see Loyalty Program above). The New Revenue Standard requires us to change our policy to the deferred revenue method and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The value of the earned mileage credits is materially greater under the deferred revenue method than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. 

The New Revenue Standard will also require certain reclassifications, principally the reclassification of certain ancillary revenues previously classified and reported as other revenue to passenger revenue and as applicable to cargo revenue. Additionally, the New Revenue Standard requires a gross presentation on the face of our statement of operations for certain revenues and expenses that had previously been presented on a net basis.

See recast 2017 statement of operations and balance sheet data presented below for the expected effects of adoption.

ASU 2017-07: Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (the New Retirement Standard)

The New Retirement Standard requires all components of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, previously reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating income (expense). The New Retirement Standard is required to be applied retrospectively, which results in the recast of each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of the New Retirement Standard has no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See recast 2017 statement of operations data presented below for the expected effects of adoption.

76

ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)

This ASU makes several modifications to Subtopic 825-10, including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and it requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard is applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2016-18: Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash

This ASU requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is required to be applied retrospectively, which results in the recast of each prior reporting period statement of cash flows presented. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Impacts to 2017 Results

The expected effects of adoption of the New Revenue Standard and New Retirement Standard to our statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The expected effects of adoption of the New Revenue Standard to our December 31, 2017 balance sheet are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

77

Standards Effective for 2019 Reporting Periods

ASU 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard)

The New Lease Standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in the New Revenue Standard. The New Lease Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect we will adopt the New Lease Standard effective January 1, 2019. Entities are required to adopt the New Lease Standard using a modified retrospective approach, which results in the recast of each prior reporting period presented, for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the New Lease Standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the New Lease Standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases.
