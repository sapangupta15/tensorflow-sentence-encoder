Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Strategic Overview 

CSX and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce. CSX’s network is positioned to reach more than two-thirds of Americans, who account for about three-quarters of the nation’s consumption of goods. The CSX rail network spans 21,000 miles of track with service to 23 states and the District of Columbia, and connects more than 70 ocean, river, and lake ports with major manufacturing and distribution centers in the Northeast, Midwest and South. Through this network, the Company transports a broad portfolio of products, ranging from coal and new energy sources, like biodiesel and ethanol, to automobiles, chemicals, military equipment and consumer products. 

In 2009, CSX and the rail industry experienced significant freight rail volume declines. During this period CSX, nonetheless, was able to make financial and operational improvements by maintaining a focus on safety, train operations and cost control. CSX took aggressive actions to manage costs and right-size resources to match demand conditions. These actions included right-sizing the labor force through furloughs to match decreasing volumes, adjusting the ONE Plan to reduce the size of its scheduled train network, adjusting the unit train network in order to conserve resources and reducing the number of active locomotives and freight cars to reduce maintenance costs. In addition to controlling resources, the Company stayed focus on striving for high safety standards and continuing to provide strong customer service. The Company also continues to advance its Total Service Integration (“TSI”) initiative, which aims to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable service to customers. 

In addition to a commitment to strengthening operational efficiency and productivity, CSX continues to invest in its network to further enhance safety and improve service and reliability for its customers. To adequately continue these investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. To that end, CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of CSX’s rail service will be reflected in new legislation and policy. 

As an example of CSX’s commitment to investing in its network and improving the flow of freight, the Company launched the National Gateway, a multi-million dollar public-private infrastructure initiative which will significantly improve the efficiency of the freight network between the Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest. When completed, the National Gateway is expected to reduce truck traffic and increase intermodal capacity on key corridors without increasing the number of trains. As a result, the Company’s customers will benefit from improved service and reliability, reduced transport times and expanded access to rail services.

PART II 

With a blend of improved safety trends, productivity gains, pricing and prudent investment in the train network and rail efficiency, the Company has positioned itself to benefit from the gradual economic recovery. The Company expects to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth for 2010. This expectation is supported by strong volume and revenue growth, including export coal shipments that could approach 30 million tons this year, and strong operating ratio improvement as well. 

2009 HIGHLIGHTS 

  ·    Revenue decreased $2.2 billion or 20% to $9.0 billion as declines in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue more than offset core pricing gains.    

  ·    Expenses decreased $1.7 billion or 20% to $6.8 billion, reflecting a sharp decline in the price of fuel as well as productivity gains and right-sizing efforts.    

  ·    Operating income decreased $483 million or 17% to $2.3 billion.    

  ·    Operating ratio improved to 74.7%, an all-time record.    

Even with a severe, broad-based economic recession, CSX delivered solid financial results. Revenues were down 20% from the prior year, as a 6.2% increase in core pricing was offset by a 15% decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge recovery (associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices). Year-over-year volume declines were experienced across all markets with the exception of the domestic intermodal segment. In this challenging environment, the Company continued to achieve pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that rail-based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. 

At the same time, CSX was able to reduce expenses by $1.7 billion, or 20%, versus the prior year. These expense reductions helped partially offset the revenue decline and were a combined result of lower fuel expense, ongoing productivity initiatives and overall cost management efforts. Because of the Company’s continued focus on cost control, CSX was able to achieve a record operating ratio of 74.7%. 

For additional information, refer to Rail and Intermodal Results of Operations discussed on pages 39 through 42. 

In addition to the financial highlights described above, the Company measures and reports safety and service performance. CSX strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, initiatives and investment. For example, the Company’s safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement. The programs utilize operating rules training, compliance measurement, root cause analysis and communication to create a safer environment for employees and the public. Continued capital investment in Company assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology, also supports safety performance.

During 2009, the Company continued to advance its efforts on safety and operating performance. CSXT delivered improved year-over-year results in both FRA personal injuries and train accidents. The FRA personal injury index declined to 1.19, a 2% improvement. Reported FRA train accident frequency declined to 2.77, for a 5% improvement. The same results over a five year period show a 49% improvement in the FRA personal injury frequency index and a 43% improvement in the FRA train accident rate which is attributable to the Company’s continuous focus on safety. 

Key service metrics remained strong in the year. On-time train originations and arrivals were 81% and 80%, respectively, for the year. CSXT reduced the number of train starts in response to lower demand which resulted in an increase in average dwell to 24.1. Average cars-on-line declined to 216,013, also primarily due to lower demand levels. Average train velocity improved to 21.8 miles per hour, as the network remained fluid. CSXT aims to maintain key operating measures and service reliability at high levels, while reducing resource utilization in response to current business conditions.

In addition to producing strong financial, safety and service results, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2009 property additions of $1.4 billion as well as $160 million of new assets purchased using seller financing were slightly lower than prior year. (These items are reflected in the investing and financing sections of the cash flow statement, respectively.) The Company remains committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. As described below, free cash flow before dividends decreased $551 million to $670 million. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased cash from operations as a result of lower earnings. Partially offsetting this decrease were fewer property additions in 2009 compared to the prior year. CSX also maintained the quarterly dividend of $0.22 throughout 2009.  

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure) 

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. 

Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. Also, added to free cash flow is the Company’s 42% economic interest in Conrail’s free cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts. 

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

      (a) As shown on the cash flow statement under supplemental cash flow information, seller financed assets included new assets purchased as well as lease buyouts. New assets purchased included in this amount were $160 million and $54 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. No new assets were purchased during 2007 using seller financing.

PART II 

2009 vs. 2008 Rail Results of Operations 

Rail Revenue 

Rail revenue, which excludes Intermodal, is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Rail revenue decreased $2.0 billion, or 20%, to $7.8 billion from the prior year driven by an 18% decline in volume and lower fuel cost recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices. The broad-based economic recession drove year-over-year volume declines across all major markets. In this challenging environment, CSXT continued to achieve pricing gains primarily due to improved service and the overall cost advantages that rail-based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. 

Merchandise 

Chemicals – Volume declined as weakness in the housing, automotive and consumer goods markets significantly reduced demand for chemical products related to those markets. Revenue per unit was flat as yield management efforts were offset by lower fuel recovery. 

Emerging Markets – Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in both residential and non-residential construction. 

Forest Products – A weak housing market drove the decline in lumber and building products. Paper volume continued to be soft due to electronic media substitution and less packaging being used as a result of lower consumer spending. 

Agricultural Products - - Volume was down slightly as the growth in ethanol and export grain was more than offset by lower poultry production which negatively impacted the feed grain and ingredient markets. 

Metals – The largest decline in volume was experienced in metals driven by weak global and domestic steel demand in the automotive and construction industries. The decline in demand moderated during the year due to replenishment of low inventories and an improvement in automotive production. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – International and domestic shipments declined due to lower phosphate and potash soil application by farmers in reaction to lower prices for grain and the tight credit environment. 

Food and Consumer –Weakness in residential construction caused reduced shipments of appliances and other consumer goods. Yet, basic needs markets such as food products were less severely impacted by the economic conditions.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Coal 

Volume declines were driven by lower demand from electric utilities and a decrease in exports compared to 2008. Domestic coal demand for generating electricity was down due to natural gas substitution and lower industrial production, resulting in continued high stock pile levels.  The 2009 export market decline was a result of both lower steel production in Europe reducing the need for metallurgical coal (used to produce steel) and less expensive alternative global sources for European utilities. Overall revenue per unit for the Coal market improved as yield management efforts more than offset lower fuel recovery. 

For 2010, domestic utility demand is expected to remain weak through the first half of the year. However, export market conditions are improving due to increasing global steel production. Export coal shipments could approach 30 million tons in 2010. This increase in demand is expected to more than offset the forecasted domestic utility coal weakness, potentially producing full year gains in overall coal, coke and iron ore shipments. 

Automotive 

Volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures and lower vehicle sales driven by the weak economy and a tight credit environment. Volume, however, improved in the second half of the year as inventories stabilized and the Cash for Clunkers program helped spur sales. Revenue per unit was negatively impacted by lower fuel recovery associated with the sharp decline in fuel prices. 

Rail Expense 

Total rail expenses for 2009 decreased 22% or $1.6 billion to $5.7 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below. 

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs. These expenses are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned, healthcare plan costs, and pension and other post-retirement plan expenses. These expenses decreased $318 million primarily driven by labor productivity initiatives, such as employee furloughs and reduced crew overtime. Lower incentive compensation was partially offset by inflation and other items.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. Materials, supplies and other expenses decreased by $403 million in 2009. This decrease is driven by several items, the largest impact being a decline in volume-related expenses. Improving trends in safety and a decrease in overall casualty claims drove a net favorable adjustment to casualty reserves during 2009. Prior year storm and proxy-related items not repeated in the current year also added to this decrease. Lastly, improved collections and a stabilizing economic environment caused a decrease in bad debt expense. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in inflation-related items in 2009. 

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $965 million primarily due to sharply lower fuel prices and lower volume. 

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $4 million primarily due to a slightly larger asset base. This increase was largely offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies. 

Equipment and Other Rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $28 million mainly due to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases. 

Inland Transportation expenses included in the rail segment are primarily for amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for shipments on CSXT’s network. These intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results. The remaining consolidated amount which fluctuates with volume is expense paid by Intermodal to other transportation companies.

PART II 

2009 vs. 2008 Intermodal Results of Operations 

Intermodal operating income decreased $128 million, or 44%, to $162 million in 2009. Intermodal revenue declined $262 million, or 18%, to $1.2 billion, due to an 8% reduction in volume and an 11% decline in revenue per unit. The volume decline was led by a decrease in international traffic due to the economy which was partially offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments, over-the-road truckload conversions, and expanded service offerings. Revenue per unit was lower primarily due to decreased fuel recovery and competitive truck pricing. 

Intermodal operating expense decreased 11%, or $134 million, to $1.0 billion driven primarily by a decline in volume and lower fuel prices. Purchased transportation expense increased over 2008 due to increased volume in domestic transcontinental traffic. 

2009 vs. 2008 Consolidated Results 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased $39 million to $558 million due to higher average debt balances in 2009. 

Other Income – Net 

Other income decreased $66 million to $34 million in 2009. Last year’s results included a $30 million non-cash adjustment to correct equity earnings from a non-consolidated subsidiary that was not repeated in the current year. This decrease also included lower average cash and investment balances and a lower average rate of return as well as lower income from real estate sales. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense decreased $230 million to $624 million primarily due to lower earnings in 2009. 

Net Earnings 

Net earnings decreased $213 million to $1.2 billion and earnings per diluted share decreased $.43 to $2.91 in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to the following factors: 

  ·    Operating income decreased $483 million primarily due to lower revenue.    

  ·    Offsetting this decrease was a $145 million increase in income from discontinued operations as 2008 included an impairment loss related to The Greenbrier as well as a $230 million decrease in tax expense.

2008 vs. 2007 Rail Results of Operations 

Rail Revenue 

Rail revenue, which excludes Intermodal, is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Rail revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 13%, to $9.8 billion in 2008 as compared to prior year. CSXT was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the Company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. Higher fuel cost recovery, coupled with favorable pricing, more than offset volume losses driven by the weakening economy. 

Merchandise 

Chemicals – Revenue and revenue-per-unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment and fuel recoveries. Volume was down as a result of declines in plastic and plastic feedstock shipments, driven by weakness in housing, automotive and consumer goods markets. 

Emerging Markets – Revenue and revenue-per-unit grew due to continued yield management efforts and favorable fuel recovery. Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in both residential and non-residential construction. These declines more than offset growth in shipments of scrubber limestone and transportation equipment. 

Forest Products – Revenue was flat and volume declined as shipments of building products slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts. Further driving volume declines was a reduction in printing paper and newsprint as a combination of electronic media substitution and reduced advertising pages affected demand. 

Agricultural Products – Revenue and volume increased due to continued growth in ethanol shipments and strong domestic demand in feed ingredients. Revenue-per-unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management and increased fuel recovery. 

Metals – Revenue and revenue-per-unit increased due to higher fuel recovery and continued pricing actions. Lower demand for steel due to continued weakness in construction and automobile production resulted in volume declines. These declines more than offset growth in shipments of pipe which were driven by increases in drilling activity and pipeline construction. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Volume declined in phosphate shipments as weak international and domestic demand resulted in plant curtailments. Revenue-per-unit increases were driven primarily by yield initiatives and increased fuel recovery.

45 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Food and Consumer – Volume declined with decreased demand for building products, appliances and consumer goods driven by the weakening economy and housing market. Revenue-per-unit growth resulted from favorable fuel recoveries and yield initiatives. 

Coal 

Favorable pricing and fuel recovery positively influenced revenue and revenue-per-unit. Volumes were slightly up as strength in the export and river markets were offset by weakness in electric utility shipments. 

Automotive 

Volume and revenue declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures, and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment. Consistent with the overall automotive market, volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically. Revenue-per-unit improved due to yield initiatives and higher fuel recoveries. 

Rail Expense 

Total rail operating expenses for 2008 increased 10% or $637 million to $7.3 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category is included in the current year’s rail expense section on the previous pages. The significant year over year changes are described below. 

Labor and Fringe expenses decreased $26 million primarily driven by reduced staffing levels and lower benefit costs which were mostly offset by wage inflation. 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses increased by $213 million in 2008 primarily due to favorable personal injury reserve benefits in the prior year. Additionally, these costs also increased as a result of inflation, proxy-related items and other items. 

Fuel expense increased $503 million due to higher fuel prices during most of the year which more than offset increased fuel efficiency. 

Depreciation expense increased $30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending. This increase was partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies. 

Equipment and Other Rents expenses decreased $24 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases.

PART II 

2008 vs. 2007 Intermodal Results of Operations 

Intermodal operating income increased to $290 million, an increase of 12% or $30 million versus last year. Improved fuel recovery and a favorable traffic mix boosted revenue per unit and allowed for an 8% increase in revenue despite 2% fewer loads. The volume impact of the continued deceleration of international traffic was somewhat offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments, over-the-road truckload conversion, and short-haul moves in the Southeast. 

Intermodal operating expense increased 7% or $80 million to $1.2 billion driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased purchased transportation expense linked to growth in domestic transcontinental traffic. Additionally, depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives that was completed a year ago. 

2008 vs. 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased $102 million in 2008 to $519 million due primarily to higher average debt balances in 2008. 

Other Income – Net 

Other income was flat with a decrease of $5 million to $100 million in 2008. Lower income from real estate sales as well as lower cash and investment balances in 2008 were offset by a $30 million non-cash adjustment to correct equity earnings from a non-consolidated subsidiary. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense increased $142 million to $854 million which was driven by higher operating income in 2008. This increase was partially offset by an $18 million income tax benefit during 2008 principally related to the settlement of federal income tax audits and certain other tax matters. 

Net Earnings 

 Net earnings increased $29 million to $1.4 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.35 to $3.34 in 2008. This increase was primarily due to the following factors: 

  ·    Operating income increased $508 million primarily driven by higher revenues. This increase in operating income was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt levels.    

  ·    Almost entirely offsetting this increase was a 2008 impairment loss related to The Greenbrier and a 2007 tax benefit associated with the sale of CSX’s International Terminals business that was not repeated.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed. 

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows 

Consolidated Balance Sheets 

CSX’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes reinvestment in the Company’s existing infrastructure, investments in the network and dividends. 

Net properties increased $525 million since December 2008 due to planned capital expenditures. Additionally, overall long-term debt obligations had a net increase of $177 million due to the new debt issuance of $500 million offset by payments of $323 million during the current year. 

Total shareholders’ equity increased $792 million during 2009. This increase was mainly attributable to net earnings partially offset by dividend payments of $345 million. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2009, the Company generated $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities which represented an $854 million decrease from the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by less cash generated from rail and intermodal operations and higher pension contributions in 2009 versus 2008. Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2012. This facility can be increased by an additional $500 million to $1.75 billion with the approval of the lending banks. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. 

CSX will also file its shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 19, 2010. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. 

In 2009, the Company entered into a $250 million receivables securitization facility. For further details, see page 50.

PART II 

Among other things, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases and to pay dividends to shareholders, as declared by the Board of Directors. CSX paid dividends of $345 million in 2009, which was $37 million more than prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share midway through 2008. Net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily as a result of $1.6 billion of prior year share repurchases that were not repeated in 2009 and was partially offset by less cash received from debt issued in 2009 as compared to 2008. 

Net cash used in investing activities during 2009 was driven by $1.4 billion of property additions. (In addition, capital expenditures for 2009 also included $160 million of new assets purchased using seller financing, which are included in financing activities on the cash flow statement). Funds used for property additions are further described below. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

   (a)    As shown on the cash flow statement under supplemental cash flow information, seller financed assets included new assets purchased as well as lease buyouts. New assets purchased included in this amount were $160 million and $54 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. No new assets were purchased during 2007 using seller financing.    

Capital spending programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation services. For 2010, CSX plans to spend $1.7 billion of capital of which 68% will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. Approximately $200 million, or 12%, of total capital spending will be applied toward the implementation of unfunded required regulatory projects such as Positive Train Control (“PTC”) which is approximately $170 million. CSX intends to fund these capital investments through funds from operations. The remaining 20% will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars and high return, growth or productivity investments such as the National Gateway (a public-private infrastructure initiative to improve network capacity between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest). 

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise this estimate as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations.

PART II 

Although new legislation or regulations, such as the STB Reauthorization Bill or climate change legislation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K), it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact. However, the Company continues to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of its operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, reducing fuel consumption and increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions. 

Liquidity and Working Capital 

Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with over $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX also has a $1.25 billion credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks that was not drawn on. Additionally, in 2009, the Company took advantage of an improvement in capital market conditions and issued $500 million of new debt.  

Also, in 2009, the Company entered into a $250 million receivables securitization facility. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. This facility has a 364-day term and expires on September 27, 2010. As of the date of this filing, CSX has not drawn on this facility. Under the terms of this facility, CSX Transportation and CSX Intermodal transfer eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX will service the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. The cash received in exchange for these receivables when CSX Trade Receivables monetizes them by selling them to third-party lenders will be recorded as debt on CSX’s consolidated financial statements due to certain optional reduction or prepayment provisions. 

Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $705 million and a working capital deficit of $13 million at December 2009 and 2008, respectively. The favorable change is primarily due to increased cash balances as a result of new debt issued during 2009. 

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. A working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility and shelf registration statement, to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA+ and Aaa1 for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. 

Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade.” Currently, CSX’s long-term ratings fall within this category. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt, could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment.  

SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 

The following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other commitments: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    Agreements with Conrail (for information about Conrail see Note 13, Related Party Transactions) represent minimum future lease payments of $21 million for freight cars and locomotives. This amount plus total operating leases-net of $391 million above equals total net lease commitments of $412 million disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.    

  (b)    Other commitments of $129 million consisted of surety bonds and letters of credit. Surety bonds are issued by a third-party as an assurance that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

  For detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. 

  There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: 

  ·    casualty, environmental and legal reserves;    

  ·    pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;    

  ·    depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and    

  ·    income taxes      

 Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves 

 Casualty 

Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company’s self-insured retention amount of $25 million per injury. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Most of the claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.

Personal Injury 

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act. 

CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT’s historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. 

Claims have shown a continued downward trend in the number of injuries, resulting in a continued reduction of the Company’s FRA personal injury rate. This reduction is a direct result of the Company’s improvement in safety. Additionally, the trend in the severity of injuries has significantly declined. During 2009, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $84 million based on management’s review of the actuarial analysis performed by an independent actuarial firm. These reductions were included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements. 

Occupational 

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss. 

Asbestos 

The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to a disease and onset of the disease) which can range from 10 years to 40 years.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

The Company retains a third-party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Company’s reserves. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty. 

The Company, with the assistance of the third-party specialist, determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Key elements of the assessment include the following: 

  ·    An estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national employment for select years during the period 1938-2001. The Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees.    

  ·    The projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees’ ages and the duration and intensity of potential exposure while employed. Epidemiology is the medical science that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a population.    

  ·    An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease (non-malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Company’s average historical claim filing rates for a three-year calibration period.    

  ·    An estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is computed using the Company’s historical average dismissal rates observed during a period that management feels is representative of future dismissal rates. This period may differ from the current calibration period and is dependent upon disease type and other determining factors.    

  ·    An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is computed using the Company’s historical average dollars paid per claim using the average settlement by type of incident observed during a period that management feels is representative of future settlement amounts. This period may differ from the current calibration period and is dependent upon disease type and other determining factors.

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represent claims that were closed without payment, are used to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that should be deducted from the total number of anticipated claims. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Company’s future liability for IBNR asbestos claims. 

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in less than a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims. 

Other Occupational 

For all other occupational claims such as solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss, the Company retains a third-party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Company’s reserves. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of IBNR claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be paid in future periods. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable period in which claim filing and claim values could be estimated with more certainty. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries. Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the following: 

  ·    An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from 2009 to 2016 based upon information obtained from the Railroad Retirement Board in its 2009 report.   

  ·    An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee is computed using the Company’s average historical claim filing rates for the calibration periods management felt were representative of future filing rates. For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the current calibration period is a two-year average of claim filings. All other diseases or injuries use a three-year calibration period. An estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired employee population each year.

  ·    An estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is computed using the Company’s historical average dismissal rates during a period that management feels is representative of future dismissal rates. This period may differ from the current calibration period and is dependent upon injury type and other determining factors.    

  ·    An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is computed using the Company’s historical average of dollars paid per claim for type of injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of future settlement amounts. This period may differ from the current calibration period and is dependent upon injury type and other determining factors.    

From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represent claims that were closed without payment, are used to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that should be deducted from the total number of anticipated claims. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Company’s future liability for IBNR asbestos claims. 

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in less than a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims. 

During 2009, the Company reduced its reserves for asbestos and occupational injuries by $43 million. Asbestos reserve reductions of $24 million were primarily related to approximately 1,500 claims that were based on unreliable medical evidence and therefore have been determined to have no value. The remaining reduction is attributable to a decrease in carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injury claims.

Environmental 

The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 257 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. 

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. 

In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as: 

  ·    type of clean-up required;    

  ·    nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);    

  ·    extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and    

  ·    number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.    

Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statement.

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Legal 

In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. 

 Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting 

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. CSX made pension plan contributions of $250 million and $102 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

In addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. The post-retirement medical plan is contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. 

58 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

  The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation—Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. 

  This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:  

  ·    long-term rate of return on plan assets;    

  ·    discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;    

  ·    salary scale inflation rates;    

  ·    health care cost trend rates; and    

  ·    other assumptions.    

These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year. As permitted by the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic the Company previously used a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post-retirement plans. During 2008, CSX changed its measurement date to its fiscal year-end in accordance with the topic noted above. The effect of the change was a $13 million after-tax reduction to retained earnings. The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the long-term rate of return, discount, salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. 

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment. 

The Company's expected long-term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its 2009 and 2008 pension obligation was 8.5%. 

59

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

Discount Rates 

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company’s expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans’ expected benefit payments. 

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2009 pension and post-retirement obligations are 5.25% and 4.75%, respectively. For 2008, the discount rate used by the company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 6.5%. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans. As of December 2009, the time horizon for pensions is approximately 11 years, while, for post-retirement, the time horizon is approximately 7 years. 

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change. 

 Salary Scale Inflation Rates 

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.0% and 3.8% to value its 2009 and 2008 pension obligation, respectively. 

Health Care Cost Trend Rates 

Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The 2009 assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations is 8.5% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and 8.0% for Medicare-eligible participants which is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5% in 2017, based upon current actuarial projections. However, the year-to-year comparisons may fluctuate. For 2008, the assumed health care cost trend rate for benefit obligations was 9.5% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and 10.5% for Medicare-eligible participants.

Other Assumptions 

 The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management. 

2010 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense 

Net pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2010 is expected to be approximately $60 million and $31 million, respectively, compared to $35 million and $34 million, respectively, in 2009. The increase in the pension expense is primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate (which causes expense to increase) and additional amortization of the losses incurred by the pension plan assets during 2008. These increases in expense were partially offset by the 2009 contributions. 

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2010 estimated pension and post-retirement expense: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method 

The Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 90% of total fixed assets of $31 billion on a gross basis at December 2009. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life. 

The Company currently utilizes more than 250 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under group life. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

  The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g. track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets. 

Under group-life, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A life study is the periodic review of asset lives for group assets conducted by a third-party expert, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires life studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. 

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations. 

There are several factors taken into account during the life study and they include: 

  ·    statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;    

  ·    statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;    

  ·    evaluation of current operations;    

  ·    evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;    

  ·    previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;    

  ·    expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and    

  ·    comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

  For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the life study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time. 

In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g. major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g. disposal of all refrigerated freight cars). 

Recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes, which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $908 million and $904 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in a $9 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. The Company completed life studies for its equipment assets in 2009 and concluded life studies for its road, track and equipment assets in 2008 resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of $18 million in 2009 and $ 32 million in 2008. 

Income Taxes 

In 2007, CSX adopted accounting guidance in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addressed how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company’s reassessment of its tax positions did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued 

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2003 and for 2007. Federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2006 currently are under appeal. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Also, the Company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.
