 Item 1. BUSINESS  

Certain information of a non-historical nature contained in Items 1, 2, 3 and 7 of this Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements. Reference is made to Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFactors that May Affect Future Operating Results, for a discussion of certain factors that could cause our Companys actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.  

General  

Patterson is a value-added distributor serving three major markets:  

       North American dental supply;  

       U.S. companion animal (dogs, cats and other common household pets) and equine veterinary supply; and  

       The worldwide rehabilitation and assistive products supply market.  

Patterson began distributing dental supplies in 1877. The modern history of the business dates to May 1985, when management and certain investors purchased the dental supply business of a subsidiary of The Beatrice Companies, Inc. Patterson became a publicly traded company in October 1992 and is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota.  

We had historically reported one operating segment, dental supply. In July 2001, the veterinary supply assets of J.A. Webster, Inc., were purchased and became a reportable business segment. Then in September 2003, AbilityOne Products Corp. was acquired, creating a third business segment which serves the rehabilitation supply market.  

In June 2004, we changed our corporate name from Patterson Dental Company to Patterson Companies, Inc. (Patterson or the Company). Patterson retained its existing NASDAQ stock symbolPDCO. The corporate name change was adopted to reflect Pattersons expanded base of business in the veterinary and rehabilitation supply markets, as well as its traditional base of operations in the dental supply market. Pattersons operating units include Patterson Dental, Webster Veterinary and Patterson Medical.  

Our three reportable segments, dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply, are strategic business units that offer similar products and services to different customer bases. Each business is a market leader with a strong competitive position, serves a fragmented market that offers consolidation opportunities and offers relatively low-cost consumable supplies, making our value-added business proposition highly attractive to customers.  

Dental Supply  

Overview  

As Pattersons largest business, Patterson Dental is one of the two largest distributors of dental products in North America. Our dental business has operations in the United States and Canada. Patterson Dental, a full-service, value-added supplier to dentists, dental laboratories, institutions, and other healthcare professionals, provides consumable products (including x-ray film, restorative materials, hand instruments and sterilization products); basic and advanced technology dental equipment; practice management and clinical software; patient education systems; and office forms and stationery. Patterson Dental offers our customers a broad selection of dental products including more than 96,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) of which approximately 5,000 are private-label products sold under the Patterson brand. Patterson Dental also offers customers a full range of related services including dental equipment installation, maintenance and repair, dental office design and equipment financing. We market our dental products and services through more than 1,500 direct sales representatives, of which approximately 300 are equipment specialists.

Table of Contents 

Patterson Dental has over 130 years of experience providing quality products and services to dental professionals. Net sales of this segment have increased from $165.8 million in fiscal 1986 to approximately $2.3 billion in fiscal 2012 and profitability has increased from an operating loss in fiscal 1986 to operating income of $246.7 million in fiscal 2012.  

We estimate the dental supply market we serve to be approximately $6.8 billion annually and that our share of this market is approximately 33%. The underlying structure of the dental supply market consists of a sizeable geographically dispersed number of fragmented dental practices and is attractive for our Companys role as a value-added, full-service distributor. According to the American Dental Association, there are over 186,000 dentists practicing in the United States. According to the Canadian Dental Association, there are approximately 20,000 licensed dentists in Canada. The average general practitioner generated approximately $728,000 in annual revenue in 2009, while the average specialty practitioner produces about $1,005,000. We believe that most dentists use between 5% and 7% of their annual revenue to purchase consumable supplies used in the daily operations of their practice. This translates into between $36,000 and $51,000 of supplies purchased by the average practice each year. We believe the average dental practitioner purchases about 40% of their supplies from their top supplier.  

Total expenditures for dental services in the United States increased from $31 billion in 1990 to $104.8 billion in 2010. We believe that the demand for dental services, equipment and supplies will continue to be influenced by the following factors:  

       Demographics. The U.S. population grew from 235 million in 1980 to 309 million in 2010, and is expected to reach 335 million by 2020. The median age of the population is also increasing, and we believe that older dental patients spend more on a per capita basis for dental services.  

       Dental products and techniques. Technological developments in dental products continue to contribute to advances in dental techniques and procedures, including cosmetic dentistry and dental implants.  

       Demand for certain dental procedures. Demand is growing for preventive dentistry and specialty services such as periodontic (the treatment of gums), endodontic (root canals), orthodontic (braces), and other dental procedures that enable patients to keep their natural teeth longer and improve their appearance.  

       Increased dental office productivity. The number of dentists per 100,000 persons in the U.S. is forecasted to decline over the next two decades. As a result, the number of patients per dental practice is expected to rise. For this reason, dentists are showing an increased willingness to invest in dental equipment and office infrastructure that can strengthen the productivity of their practices.  

       Demand for infection control products. Greater public awareness as well as regulations and guidelines instituted by OSHA, the American Dental Association and state regulatory authorities have resulted in increased use of infection control (asepsis) products such as protective clothing, gloves, facemasks, and sterilization equipment to prevent the spread of communicable diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis and herpes.  

       Coverage by dental plans. An increasing number of dental services are being funded by private dental insurance. In 2009, over 55% of the U.S. population had some form of dental coverage.  

Strategy  

Our objective is to remain a leading national distributor of supplies, equipment and related services in the market while continuing to improve our profitability and enhance our value to customers. To achieve this objective, we have adopted a strategy of emphasizing our value-added, full-service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve our own operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions.

Emphasizing Value-Added, Full-Service Capabilities. Patterson Dental is positioned to meet virtually all of the needs of dental practitioners by providing a full range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. We believe that our customers value full service and responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment. Customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services, and generally, a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry. Our knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchase of supplies and equipment. In addition, our high quality sales force allows us to offer broader product lines. Because most dental practices lack a significant degree of back office support, the convenience of our full-service capabilities enables dentists to spend more time with patients and, thus, generate additional revenues.  

We meet our customers requirements by delivering frequent, small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from our strategically located distribution centers. Equipment specialists, service technicians and technology advisors also support our value-added strategy. Equipment specialists offer consultation on office design, equipment requirements and financing. Our experienced service technicians perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services, including services on products purchased from others. Technology advisors from our sales branches provide guidance on integrating technology solutions, including practice management and clinical software, digital radiography, custom hardware and networking into the dental practice.  

Using Technology to Enhance Customer Service. As part of Patterson Dentals commitment to providing superior customer service, we offer our customers easy order placement. We have offered electronic ordering capability to our dental supply segment since 1987, when we first introduced Remote Order Entry (REMOSM). Over the years, Patterson Dental has continued to introduce new order entry systems designed to meet the varying needs of our customers. We believe that computerized order entry systems help establish relationships with new customers and increase loyalty among existing customers by permitting customers to place orders from their offices directly to Patterson Dental 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  

Today we offer four convenient ordering systems to the dental supply segment, eMAGINE®, REMOSM, PDXpress® and www.pattersondental.com, which we launched in fiscal 2012 to provide our customers with better search capabilities, easier access to their order history, customized purchase reports, and fingertip access to Patterson Advantage, the segments customer loyalty program. Customers, as well as our sales force, use these systems. Over the years, the number of orders transmitted electronically has grown steadily to approximately 74% of our consumable dental product volume or $960 million in fiscal year 2012. In addition to enhancing customer service by offering electronic order entry systems to our customers, these systems enable our sales representatives to spend more time with existing customers and to call on additional customers.  

The goal of Patterson Dentals Internet strategy is to distribute information and service related products over the Internet to enhance customers practices and to increase sales force productivity. Our Internet environment includes order entry, customer-loyalty program reports and services, access to Patterson Today articles and manufacturers product information. Additionally, Patterson Dental utilizes a tool, InfoSource®, to provide real time customer and sales information to our sales force, managers and vendors via the Internet.  

Our proprietary practice management and clinical software, EAGLESOFT®, is developed and maintained by our Patterson Technology Center (PTC). We believe the PTC differentiates Patterson Dental from our competition by positioning Patterson Dental as the only company providing a single-source solution for the high growth area of digital radiography. This technology, which we expect to install in most dental offices, has a current market penetration of approximately 50%. Among our many specialized capabilities, the PTC, in conjunction with specialists from the sales branch, provides system configuration, as well as the seamless integration of all digital operatory components with clinical software, including our EAGLESOFT® products. This integration creates an electronic patient database that combines the patients front office record with digital information from the clinical x-ray, intra-oral camera, CEREC® system and other digital equipment. Patterson

Table of Contents 

 Dental offers our EAGLESOFT® practice management software at no cost to customers with a subscription to support services. The local sales branch, in conjunction with the PTC, will network the digital x-ray system throughout the entire office, offers all required custom computer hardware for the system, and provides installation and customer training. The PTC has a call center that troubleshoots customer problems and arranges for local service when needed.  

Software and digital radiography customers also have access to the PTCs support capabilities. The PTC provides support for Pattersons proprietary products as well as select branded product from manufacturers, such as SIRONA and SCHICK. In addition to troubleshooting problems through the PTCs support center, customers can access various service capabilities offered by the PTC including electronic claims and statement processing and system back-up capabilities.  

Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Patterson Dental continues to implement programs designed to improve our operating efficiencies and allow for continued sales growth over time. These programs include a wide variety of initiatives from our continuing investment in management information systems to consolidation of distribution centers and sales branches. More recent initiatives include upgrading our order entry and order management systems.  

Patterson Dental has improved operating efficiencies by converting our communications architecture to faster, higher capacity data lines that combine voice and data transmissions. We have developed a new field service management tool for our technical service operations, improving our ability to coordinate the actions of service technicians and enhancing customer service while reducing the overall cost of operations.  

An integral part of our shared services concept is the consolidation and leveraging of distribution centers between Pattersons segments. As of April 2012, eight distribution centers are shared between two or all three of our operating units. In addition, we have established shared sales branch offices in several locations between multiple segments. Because of these and other efforts, we expect to continue to improve our operating expense leverage and efficiencies going forward.  

Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. We intend to continue to grow by opening additional sales offices, hiring established sales representatives, hiring and training skilled sales professionals as territory sales representatives, and acquiring other distributors in order to enter new, or more deeply penetrate existing, geographic markets and expand our customer base. We believe that Patterson Dental is well positioned to take advantage of expected continued consolidation in the dental distribution market. Over the past 25 years Patterson has made a number of acquisitions, including the following:  

Dental distribution acquisitions  

       Since 1987, Patterson has acquired over 30 dental products distributors in the United States and Canada. These acquisitions have included the third largest dental dealer in the United States and the second largest dental dealer in Canada, as well as regional and local dental dealers throughout North America. As a result of these acquisitions, along with internal expansion, we are now one of the two largest full service dental products distributors in both the United States and Canada.  

Printed office products acquisitions  

       In October 1996, we acquired the Colwell Systems division of Deluxe Corporation. Colwell Systems, now known as Patterson Office Supplies, produces and sells a variety of printed office products used in medical, dental and veterinary offices, as well as other clinical based settings.  

Software acquisitions

     become the Patterson Technology Center and are located in Effingham, Illinois. In December 2001, Patterson purchased Modern Practice Technologies, a company that provided custom computing solutions to the dental industry. This acquisition helped us to position ourselves to provide all of the custom hardware and networking required for interfacing the entire dental office.  

       In May 2004, Patterson Dental acquired CAESY Education Systems, Inc., the leading provider of electronic patient education services to dental practices in North America. Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, CAESY provides dental practices with a range of communications media that educate patients about professional dental care, procedures and treatment alternatives with the goal of facilitating patient decisions about dental services and increasing the productivity of the dental professional. Educational materials are communicated through CD/DVD media, software-as-a-service, computer programs and the dentists web site. These materials can be used within the dental waiting room, at chair side and in the patients home.  

       In December 2008, Patterson Dental acquired Dolphin Imaging Systems, LLC and Dolphin Practice Management, LLC, the leading providers of 3D imaging and practice management software for specialized dental practitioners, including orthodontists, oral maxillofacial surgeons and dental radiologists. Dolphins imaging software maximizes the benefit of cone beam and other digital photography and radiography systems. We believe there are no major competitors for Dolphins full range of products.  

Products and Services  

The following table sets forth the percentage of total sales by the principal categories of products and services offered to our dental segment customers:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Consists of other value-added products and services including technical service and software maintenance.  

Consumable and Printed Products  

Dental Supplies. We offer a broad product line of consumable dental supplies such as x-ray film and solutions; impression materials; restorative materials (composites and alloys); hand instruments; sterilization products; anesthetics; infection control products such as protective clothing, gloves and facemasks; paper, cotton and other disposable products; toothbrushes and a full line of dental accessories including hand instruments, burs, and diamonds. In addition to representing a wide array of branded products from numerous manufacturers, we also market our own private label line of dental supplies including anesthetics, instruments, preventive and restorative products, and cotton and paper products. Our private label line complements the branded products for customers seeking a lower cost alternative on products that have become a commodity in the market. Compared to most name brand supplies, the private label line provides lower prices for our customers and higher margins for Patterson.  

Printed Office Products. Patterson Dental, through Patterson Office Supplies (POS) provides a variety of printed office products, office filing supplies, and practice management systems to office-based healthcare providers including dental, veterinary and medical offices. Products include custom printed products, insurance and billing forms, stationery, envelopes, business cards, labels, file folders, appointment books and other stock office supply products.

Table of Contents 

These office products are sold through our sales force as well as direct mail catalogs distributed to over 100,000 customers several times per year. A staff of telemarketing personnel located in Champaign, Illinois supports both channels, receiving orders by telephone, through the mail or electronically from the dental, veterinary and medical distribution order processing system.  

Equipment and Software  

Dental Equipment. Patterson Dental is the largest supplier of dental equipment in the U.S. and Canada. We offer a wide range of dental equipment products including radiography equipment, high and low-speed hand pieces, dental chairs, dental hand piece control units, diagnostic equipment, sterilizers, dental lights and compressors. We also distribute newer technology equipment that provides our customers with tools to improve productivity and patient satisfaction. Examples of such innovative and higher productivity products include the CEREC® family of products, a chair-side restoration system; digital imaging products (including intra-oral, panoramic and 3-D or cone beam x-rays); and inter-oral cameras.  

Software. Patterson Dental develops and markets our own proprietary line of practice management and clinical software for dental professionals, including software for scheduling, billing, charting and capture/storage/retrieval of digital images. Patterson Dental also sells software products developed by third parties, including SIDEXIS® by Sirona and Dimax2 by Planmeca. These value-added products are designed to help achieve office productivity improvements, which translate into higher profitability for the customer.  

Hardware. We offer our dental customers custom hardware and networking solutions required for integrating the entire dental office, which marks another step in our overall strategy of providing customers with the convenience and cost-effectiveness of a virtually complete range of products and value-added services.  

Patient Education Services. The CAESY® education systems line of products, now available as software-as-a-service in addition to DVD format, offers patient education products and services. These communication tools are designed to educate patients in an efficient, cost-effective manner.  

Other  

Software Services. Patterson offers a variety of services to complement our software products, such as service agreements, software training, electronic claims processing and billing statement processing. These services provide value to customers by allowing them to keep their software products current or receive payments more rapidly while obtaining greater productivity.  

Equipment Installation, Repair and Maintenance. To keep their practices running efficiently, dentists require reliable performance from their equipment. All major equipment sold by Patterson includes installation and our 90-day labor warranty at no additional charge. Patterson also provides complete repair and maintenance services for all dental equipment, whether or not purchased from Patterson, including 24-hour hand piece repair service. In addition to service technicians, who provide installation and repair services on basic dental equipment, we have also invested in personnel who specialize in installing and troubleshooting issues with technology solutions such as practice management software, digital imaging products, hardware and networking. The goal of this group, which is comprised of both local service technicians and the PTC, is to help customers integrate newer technology into their dental practices. The PTC helps our customers minimize costly downtime by offering a single point of contact for post-sale technology related issues.  

Dental Office Design. Patterson provides dental office layout and design services using a computer-aided design (CAD) program. Equipment specialists can create original or revise existing dental office designs in a fraction of the time required to produce conventional drawings. Customers purchasing major equipment items receive dental office design services at no additional charge.

Equipment Financing. Patterson Dental provides a variety of options to fulfill our customers financing needs. For qualified purchasers of equipment, we will arrange customer financing through Patterson or a third party. For non-equipment related needs, such as for working capital or real estate, customers are also referred to a third party. These alternatives allow us to offer our customers convenience while still meeting their diverse financing needs. In fiscal 2012, we originated approximately $287.6 million of equipment finance contracts in the United States. Patterson Dental, or our third party vendor, financed approximately 42% of the equipment purchased by our customers during fiscal 2012.  

Since November 1998, Patterson Dental has maintained one or more finance referral agreements with outside finance companies to provide a more extensive selection of finance opportunities to our customers. This might include financing for practice transition transactions, working capital, leasing, real estate and long-term capital. Currently this service is provided by Wells Fargo Practice Finance, a division of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. Patterson receives referral fees under this agreement, and Wells Fargo extends credit and services the accounts.  

Patterson Dental has created a special purpose entity (SPE), PDC Funding Company, LLC, a wholly-owned and fully consolidated subsidiary, and entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement in order to participate in a commercial paper conduit. We transfer finance contracts we originate to the SPE. In turn, the SPE sells the contracts to the commercial paper conduit. As of April 28, 2012, the maximum outstanding capacity of this arrangement at any one time is $500 million.  

A second SPE, PDC Funding Company II, LLC, sells contracts through a Contract Purchase Agreement to a bank. This agreement operates similarly to the Receivables Purchase Agreement described above, except that the capacity is $75 million.  

There is no recourse to Patterson for contracts purchased by either the commercial paper conduit or the bank, but there is a deferred purchase price equal to approximately 16% of the principal of these contracts. Patterson services the customer contracts under both of these arrangements in exchange for a fee that approximates our cost for providing the service.  

Sales and Marketing  

During fiscal 2012, Patterson Dental sold products or services to over 120,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada who made one or more purchases during the year. Patterson Dentals customers include dentists, laboratories, institutions and other healthcare professionals. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of sales during fiscal 2012, and Patterson Dental is not dependent on any single customer or geographic group of customers. Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and improve customer relationships through personal interaction with our sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact, which underscores our value-added approach.  

Patterson Dental has over 90 local offices throughout the U.S. and Canada so that we can provide a presence in the market and decision making near the customer. These offices, or sales branches, are staffed with a complete complement of Patterson Dental capabilities, including sales, customer service and technical service personnel, as well as a local manager who has broad decision making authority with regard to customer related transactions and issues.  

A primary component of Patterson Dentals value-added approach is our sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the dental supply market, we believe that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry; assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products, and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Each sales representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location (branch) manager. Sales representatives are all Patterson employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis, with some, less experienced, representatives receiving a base salary and commission.  

9  

Table of Contents 

To assist our sales representatives, Patterson Dental publishes a variety of catalogs and fliers containing product and service information. Dental customers receive a full-line product catalog containing over 35,000 inventoried items. The catalog includes pictures of products, detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is used by practitioners as a reference source. Selected consumable supplies, new products, specially priced items and high demand items such as infection control products, are promoted through merchandise fliers printed and distributed bi-monthly. In addition, dental equipment sold by Patterson is featured in our tri-yearly publication, Patterson Today, which also includes articles on dental office design, trends in dental practice, products and services offered by Patterson Dental and information on equipment maintenance.  

To enhance the total value we bring to our customers, Patterson Dental offers a value-added benefit program for our preferred customers. The PATTERSON ADVANTAGESM program enables members to earn Advantage Dollars which can be applied toward future purchases of equipment and technology products. Patterson Advantage also entitles our best customers to priority technical services, automated supply management summary reports, educational materials and a variety of exclusive discount offers.  

Distribution  

Patterson Dental believes that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is key to customer satisfaction. We ship dental consumable supplies from eight strategically located distribution centers in the U.S. and two in Canada. Orders for consumable dental supplies can be placed by telephone or electronically 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Printed office products are shipped from our manufacturing and distribution facility in central Illinois.  

All orders are routed through our centralized computer ordering, shipping and inventory management systems, which are linked to each of our strategically located distribution centers. If an item is not available in the distribution center nearest to the customer, the computer system automatically directs fulfillment of the item from another center. Rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of our value-added approach. We estimate that 98% of Patterson Dentals consumable goods orders are shipped to the customer on time, which is generally within 24 hours.  

In order to assure the availability of Patterson Dentals broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers, we must maintain sufficient inventories at our distribution centers. Purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized, and our purchasing department uses a real-time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels. Our inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items. By utilizing computerized inventory management and ordering systems, we are able to accurately predict inventory turns in order to minimize inventory levels for each item.  

Patterson Dentals more than 90 dental sales offices are generally configured with display areas where the latest dental equipment can be demonstrated. Dental equipment is generally custom ordered and is staged at our sales branches before delivery to dental offices for installation.  

Sources of Supply  

Effective purchasing is a key strategy Patterson Dental has adopted in order to achieve our objective of continuing to improve profitability. We have a program to effectuate electronic data interchange (EDI) with our major vendor partners. In fiscal 2012, we processed approximately 63% of our invoices from dental vendors using EDI capabilities. In addition, approximately 67% of our dental purchase order volume was conducted through EDI. Utilizing EDI allows us to improve efficiencies and reduce administrative costs.  

Patterson Dental obtains products from more than 800 vendors. In June 2012 we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Sirona Dental Systems, Inc., the manufacturer of the CEREC® dental restorative systems and Schick® digital x-rays, in addition to sophisticated panoramic and cone beam radiography product. We are also the only national dealer for A-dec equipment, including chairs, units and cabinetry. A-dec Inc., is the largest manufacturer of dental equipment in the U.S.  

10  

Table of Contents 

While Patterson Dental makes purchases from many suppliers, and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable. Our top ten supply vendors accounted for approximately 45% and 43% of the cost of dental products sold in both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Of these ten, the top two vendors accounted for 13% and 11% of both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 cost of sales, respectively.  

Competition  

The highly competitive U.S. dental products distribution industry consists principally of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. The dental supply market is extremely fragmented. In addition to Patterson Dental and one other national, full-service firm, Sullivan-Schein Dental, a unit of Henry Schein, Inc., there are at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level, and hundreds of small local distributors. Also, some manufacturers sell directly to end users.  

We approach our markets by emphasizing and delivering a value-added model to the practitioner. To differentiate ourselves from our competition, we deploy a strategy of premium customer service, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, experienced service technicians, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and distribution centers, and competitive pricing.  

Patterson Dental also experiences competition in Canada in the dental supply market. The principal competitor is a national, full-service dental distributor, Henry Schein Ash Arcona, a unit of Henry Schein, Inc. We believe we compete in Canada on essentially the same basis as in the United States.  

Veterinary Supply  

Overview  

Webster Veterinary, or Webster, is a leading distributor of veterinary supplies primarily to companion-pet (dogs, cats and other common household pets) and equine veterinary clinics across the United States. Webster provides products and services used for the diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of diseases in companion animals and equine. Originally founded in 1946 and headquartered in Massachusetts, Webster has developed a strong brand identity as a value-added, full-service distributor with a comprehensive offering of pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, veterinary diets, nutritionals, consumable supplies, equipment, and software. Websters product offering, totaling more than 36,000 items, is sold by approximately 214 field sales representatives.  

Net sales by Webster in fiscal 2012 were $734.4 million and operating income totaled $38.8 million. In addition to our core business of distributing veterinary products, Webster has a significant agency commission business with several pharmaceutical manufacturers. Under the agency relationships, Webster receives orders for products from customers, transmits these orders to vendors who then pick, pack, and ship the products. These vendors then invoice and collect payment from our customers. Webster receives a commission payment for soliciting the order and for providing other customer service activities. The agency commissions that Webster earns range from 3% to 6%, a portion of which is shared with the field sales and customer service representatives. Websters agency commissions accounted for less than 1% of our net sales in fiscal 2012.  

We estimate the market for pharmaceuticals and supplies sold to companion animal and equine veterinarians through distribution is approximately $3.2 billion on an annual basis. Based upon the estimated $3.2 billion market, we believe our share of this market is approximately 21%. Similar to the dental supply market, the veterinary supply market is fragmented and geographically diverse. As of December 31, 2011, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, or AVMA, there were more than 63,000 veterinarians in private practice nationwide specializing in small animals, predominately companion pets. The average private veterinary practice generates approximately $1,000,000 of annual revenue. These practices purchase between $120,000 and  

11  

Table of Contents 

 $140,000 of supplies each year, and similar to the dental practitioner, tend not to maintain a large supply of inventory on hand. The typical veterinary practice purchases approximately 80% of its supplies from its top two suppliers. The average purchase of consumables by the veterinary practice is noticeably higher than that of the dental practitioner due predominately to pharmaceutical products, which are administered and dispensed by veterinarians.  

Historically, the demand for veterinary services has grown significantly faster than growth in the overall economy. More recently the market growth has slowed as a result of a decrease in consumer spending. However we anticipate increasing demand for veterinary services due to the following favorable factors:  

       Number of households with companion animals. The number of households with companion animals is steadily expanding which increases the demand for veterinary services. Today, the percentages of U.S. households owning dogs, cats and horses are 46.3%, 38.9%, and 2.4%, respectively.  

       Veterinary expenditures per household. The amount pet owners are willing to spend caring for their pets is increasing substantially. The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association estimates that pet owners will spend $53 billion in 2012 to care for the American pet population, a significant increase compared to $41.2 billion spent in 2007.  

       Veterinary products and techniques. Many new therapeutic and preventive products are being developed for the companion animal market. Technological developments have resulted in new innovative veterinary products and advances in veterinary services.  

Strategy  

Websters objective is to build a leading national position in the companion animal veterinary market through internal expansion and acquisitions, while continuing to improve our profitability and enhance our value to customers. Our key strategies and priorities for accomplishing these objectives include growing through internal expansion and acquisitions, emphasizing our value-added full-service capabilities, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and expanding our service offerings.  

Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. We intend to continue to grow by opening additional sales offices, hiring established sales representatives, hiring and training skilled sales professionals as territory sales representatives, and acquiring other distributors in order to enter new, or more deeply penetrate existing, geographic markets and expand our customer base. We believe that Webster is well positioned to take advantage of expected continued consolidation in the veterinary distribution market. Over the past 10 years Webster has made a number of acquisitions, including the following:  

Veterinary distribution acquisitions  

       Since 2004, Webster has acquired several veterinary distributors in the United States. These acquisitions include two regional distributors, ProVet, which was the companion animal veterinary supply division of Lextron, Inc., and Columbus Serum Company, as well as Milburn Distributions, Inc., the largest distributor specializing in the U.S. equine veterinary supply market, and selected local and specialty distributors. Most recently, in August 2011, Webster acquired American Veterinary Supply Corporation, a full service distributor on Long Island, New York with annualized sales of approximately $25 million that served approximately 2,000 veterinary practices and hospitals in the New York metropolitan area.  

       In April 2010, Webster made a minority equity investment in Strategic Pharmaceutical Solutions, Inc. dba VetSource, a leading North American provider of integrated specialty pharmacy distribution, including home delivery capabilities.

       In January 2011, Webster acquired ePet Records, LLC. Rebranded as ePETHEALTH, this innovative communication platform provides practitioners with a secure Internet portal for their clients to access 24/7 for their pets medical information plus descriptive, easy-to-understand resources and educational materials with 3D graphics. Through ePETHEALTH, veterinarians can also send their clients automated electronic health service and appointment reminders, eNewsletters and health education articles and videos.  

Emphasizing Value-Added, Full-Service Capabilities. Webster believes that veterinary customers value full service and responsive delivery of product, in addition to competitive prices. Customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services, and, generally, a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry. Websters knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchasing of supplies. Most veterinarians are independent, or small unit based, practitioners who are unable to store and manage large volumes of supplies in their offices. We meet our customers requirements by delivering frequent, small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from strategically located distribution centers.  

Equipment specialists, technology specialists and service technicians also support our value-added strategy. Equipment specialists offer consultation on office design, equipment requirements and financing. Technology specialists provide guidance on integrating technology solutions including practice management software, client education and communication software, and our home delivery service offering. Our experienced service technicians perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services, including service on products or equipment not purchased through Webster.  

Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Webster continues to implement programs designed to improve our operating efficiencies and allow for continued sales growth over time. These programs include a wide variety of initiatives from our continuing investment in management information systems to consolidation of distribution centers and sales branches.  

In June 2011, Webster implemented a centralized return processing center located in Columbus, Ohio. This initiative has allowed us to more efficiently handle customer product returns, improve the customers experience as well as meet vendor return requirements. As a result of implementing the centralized return processing center, approximately 87% of returns are credited back to the customer within 24 hours of receipt. Centralizing this process has also lead to both operational efficiencies as well as a reduction in shipping costs associated with product returns.  

Expanding our Services. Webster continuously seeks to broaden our service offerings to maximize sales opportunities within our existing customer base while strengthening and enhancing practice and pet health.  

Technical Service. In October 2011, Webster launched onsite preventative maintenance and repair services in select markets covering a wide range of equipment. Our experienced service technicians perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services including services on products not purchased through Webster.  

ePetHealth. A leading suite of communication and educational tools designed to help the clinic increase compliance and pet-owner loyalty to the practice through: clinic eMarketing tools, health service reminders, online medical records, drug home delivery and award winning DIA videos and content.  

DIA. Our premier client education software for companion animal and equine practices. Provides over 3,000 illustrations, animations, clinical images, radiographs and other diagnostic images cover a wide range of medical

 conditions. Additionally, DIA Reception provides high definition footage and animations to better explain common pet health issues conditions to pet owners.  

Webster VetSource. A leading professional pharmacy providing home delivery service of medications to pet owners which improves client compliance, retains drug revenues within the veterinary practice, and optimizes inventory investments.  

Webster Veterinary University. Websters exclusive training course for veterinary office managers and veterinarians provides practice management tools and solutions with four in-depth courses covering human resources, inventory, marketing, and finance. Additionally, a program has been developed for veterinary hospital receptionists.  

Dental Wet Labs. Webster offers dental wet labs throughout the United States providing approved continuing education credits to attendees through lecture and hands-on labs for companion animal dental techniques.  

National Handpiece Repair. In February 2012, we launched Websters Veterinary dental handpiece repair initiative utilizing Patterson Dentals National Repair Center. Practitioners can now have both their high-speed and slow-speed handpieces cleaned, repaired, and returned within 24 hours from receipt.  

Anesthesia Technical Support Hotline. Using our dedicated hotline, with one phone call customers can obtain answers and detail support for their anesthesia and monitoring equipment.  

Products and Services  

The following table sets forth the percentage of total sales by the principal categories of products and services offered to veterinary segment customers:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consumable and Printed Products  

Webster offers our customers a broad selection of veterinary supply products including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, veterinary pet foods, nutritional products and consumable supplies. Our pharmaceutical products typically include anesthetics, analgesics, antibiotics, and ophthalmics. Our biological products are primarily comprised of vaccines and injectibles. Our parasiticides are used for control of external parasites (fleas, ticks, flies, mosquitoes) and internal parasites. Our diagnostics product category includes consumable in-clinic tests for detecting heartworm, lyme disease, feline leukemia and parvovirus, as well as consumable products for measuring blood chemistry, electrolyte balance and cell counts. Veterinary pet foods consist of both specialty diets and premium pet foods. Nutritional products are comprised of dietary supplements, vitamins, dental chews and specialty treats. Consumable supplies include lab supplies, various types and sizes of paper goods, needles and syringes, instruments, gauze and wound dressings, sutures, latex gloves, orthopedic and casting products. Many of the office supply products sold by Patterson Office Supplies are also offered to the veterinary supply market.  

Equipment and Software  

Veterinary Equipment. Webster sells equipment for hospital, laboratory and general surgical use within the veterinary practice. We also offer innovative, quality equipment that differentiates Webster from the competition  

14  

Table of Contents 

 including anesthesia machines, surgical monitors, diagnostic equipment, ultrasound, dental power units, cages, lights, digital x-ray systems and x-ray machines. Approximately 50% of veterinary equipment orders are drop shipped directly to the customer from the manufacturer. The remaining half of veterinary equipment is distributed in a manner similar to consumable supplies.  

Practice Management Software. Webster develops and markets our own proprietary line of practice management software, INTRAVET®, for veterinary professionals, including software for scheduling, billing, charting and capture/storage/retrieval of digital images.  

Client Education Software. Webster also develops and markets our own proprietary client education software, DIA®, for veterinary professionals. DIA encompasses over 3000 3D clinical animations and images, enabling veterinarians to more fully explain and illustrate a pets diagnosis and treatment recommendations to their clients.  

Client Communication portal. Webster develops and markets our own innovative web-based client communication platform, ePetHealth, providing practitioners a suite of client offerings such as online medical records, eMarketing tools, client education resources, and a home delivery portal.  

Other  

Other products and services include commissions earned on agency sales, equipment repair revenues, software maintenance contract revenue and freight recovery on shipments to customers.  

Sales and Marketing  

During fiscal 2012, Webster sold products or services to over 22,000 customers in the U.S. who made one or more purchases during the year. Our customers include veterinarians, laboratories, institutions and other animal health professionals. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of sales during fiscal 2012, and Webster is not dependent on any single customer or geographic group of customers. Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and improve customer relationships through personal interaction with our field sales and customer service representatives and frequent direct marketing contact, which underscores our value-added approach.  

Webster currently has 18 local offices throughout the U.S. so that we can provide a presence in the market and decision making near the customer. These offices, or branches, are staffed with a complete complement of Websters capabilities, including sales, customer service and technical service personnel, as well as a local manager who has broad decision making authority with regard to customer related transactions and issues.  

Field Sales Representatives. A primary component of Websters value-added approach is our sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the veterinary supply market, we believe that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry; assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Each sales representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location (branch) manager. Sales representatives are all Webster employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis, with some, less experienced, representatives receiving a base salary and commission.  

Customer Service Representative. We support our field sales representatives and direct marketing efforts with customer service representatives in ten call centers covering the United States. As of April 28, 2012, we had 135 customer service representatives. Customer service representatives work in tandem with our field sales representatives, providing a dual coverage approach for individual customers. In addition to processing orders, customer service representatives are responsible for assisting customers with ordering, informing customers of monthly promotions, and responding to general inquiries. Customer service representatives utilize our  

customized order entry system to process customer orders, access pricing, determine product availability, provide promotional information about products, research customer preferences, and review order histories.  

15  

Table of Contents 

Direct Marketing. To assist our sales representatives, Webster publishes a catalog containing product and service information. Webster customers receive a full-line product catalog containing over 11,000 inventoried items. The catalog includes pictures of products, detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is used by practitioners as a reference source. We also promote selected consumable products, our value-added program and services, new products, specially priced items and high demand items through our monthly magazine, Insight. Additional direct marketing tools that we utilize include equipment catalogs, customer loyalty programs, specific product and vendor programs, flyers, faxes, and other promotional materials. In order to extend our customer reach and enhance customer interaction, we also participate in national, regional and local trade shows.  

E-Commerce Platform. Websters website allows customers the ability to order items 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The website also incorporates value-added functions that permit customers to check their invoice, payment and credit history, build a shopping list of frequently purchased items and track their order status.  

Distribution  

Webster believes that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is key to customer satisfaction. We ship veterinary consumable supplies from 11 strategically located distribution centers in the United States. Orders for veterinary consumable supplies can be placed through our field sales force, customer service representatives or electronically 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Printed office products are shipped from Pattersons manufacturing and distribution facility in central Illinois.  

All orders are routed through our centralized computer ordering, shipping and inventory management systems, which are linked to each of our strategically located distribution centers. If an item is not available in the distribution center nearest to the customer, the computer system automatically directs fulfillment of the item from another center. Rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of our value-added approach. We estimate that 97% of Websters consumable orders are received by the customer the next business day.  

In order to assure the availability of Websters broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers, we must maintain sufficient inventories at our distribution centers. Purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized, and our purchasing department uses a real-time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels. Our inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items and pharmaceutical products. By utilizing computerized inventory management and ordering systems, we are able to accurately predict inventory turns in order to minimize inventory levels for each item.  

Sources of Supply  

Webster obtains products from nearly 600 vendors. While Webster makes purchases from many vendors and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products, the concentration of business with key vendors is considerable. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, Websters top 10 veterinary supply manufacturers comprised 67%, and the single largest supplier comprised 13%, of the total cost of veterinary supply sales.  

There are two major types of arrangements that account for the flow of transactions between us and our customers. Traditional buy/sell transactions, which account for the vast majority of our business, involve direct purchases of products by us from vendors, which we manage and store in our distribution centers. A customer then places an order with us, and the order is then picked, packed, shipped and billed by us to our customer.  

We also process orders from our customers under agency agreements with some of our vendors, primarily for certain seasonal pharmaceutical products. Under this model, when we receive orders for products from the customer, we transmit the order to the vendor who then picks, packs, and ships the products. The vendor then invoices and collects payment from our customer. We receive a commission payment for soliciting the order and for providing other customer service activities.

Table of Contents 

Competition  

The distribution and manufacture of veterinary products is highly competitive. In addition to two other national, full-service firms, Butler Schein Animal Health, Inc. and MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc., Webster competes with several full-service distributors that operate on a regional level and numerous smaller local and specialty distributors and to lesser extent, mail order distributors or buying groups. Webster also competes directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products directly to the customer.  

Webster approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value-added model to the practitioner. To differentiate our self from our competition we deploys a strategy of premium customer service, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and competitive pricing.  

Rehabilitation Supply  

Overview  

Patterson Medical is headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois, and is the worlds leading value added distributor of rehabilitation medical supplies and equipment. We believe Patterson Medical offers the most comprehensive range of distributed and self-manufactured rehabilitation products to health care professionals globally. Our mission is to provide health care professionals and their patients with access to products that improve peoples lives by helping them to attain their highest achievable level of independence, safety and comfort. We operate as Patterson Medical globally, and are transitioning our acquired catalog brands such as Sammons Preston, Homecraft, and Ausmedic into product brands. Patterson Medical still operates as Medco Sports Medicine in the North American sports medicine market.  

Patterson Medical serves as the gateway through which over 30,000 rehabilitation products originating from more than 1,500 suppliers and manufacturers are sold to a diverse customer base with an emphasis on physical therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs). We offer our customers a one-stop shop through what we believe to be the most comprehensive catalogs in the industry, the largest direct sales force and the categorys most efficient customer service and distribution operations. Major channels of distribution are acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, rehabilitation clinics, dealers and schools. In addition, we believe Patterson Medicals reputation, global market presence and highly transferable business model will facilitate entry into new markets.  

Patterson Medical offers a wide range of differentiated, non-invasive products and expertise to users and their health care providers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where our capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. Patterson Medicals goal is to become our customers first choice for rehabilitation supplies and equipment in each of our chosen markets.  

Patterson Medical is highly diversified with no single product, customer or purchasing group representing a significant percentage of total revenue. In addition, given the relatively small average order size (approximately $225), our products often do not represent a major expense category for our customers.  

Patterson Medical has been pursuing a strategy of organic growth, complemented by strategic acquisitions in its domestic and international markets. This has included building and buying branch offices in the U.S., and buying and integrating distributors in the U.K., France, and Australia. Patterson Medical also uses a robust international dealer network to service customers in countries where we do not have an established direct presence. Approximately 65% of Patterson Medicals revenue originates in North America.  

Patterson Medical manufactures or has exclusively manufactured for us products representing approximately 35% of our total revenue. These products carry the Patterson Medical brand, or one of the many brands added through acquisition. Patterson Medical owns manufacturing facilities in the U.S., France, the U.K.  

17  

Table of Contents 

 Australia, and Thailand, and has a China sourcing office. Patterson Medical is a distributor for the other 65% of our product offering, carrying the top brands in the rehabilitation industry. One of Patterson Medicals strengths is our trading relationship with the top manufacturers of rehabilitation products in the U.S. and abroad.  

We believe the rehabilitation medical supply and assistive product industry is approximately $5.6 billion worldwide and is expected to grow faster than the overall economy over the next several years. Industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated with the aging of the baby-boom generation. We do not participate in all product segments, so Patterson Medicals addressable market (defined as the collective market for products sold by Patterson Medical) is approximately $3.4 billion worldwide. We believe that Patterson Medical has an industry leading market share of approximately 15% in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market.  

We believe that the demand for rehabilitation products will continue to be influenced by the following factors:  

       Favorable Demographics. Favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy, active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being, are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by Patterson Medical. Specifically, the aging baby-boomer population, together with their increased disposable income and desire for independence, will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth.  

The U.S. Census Bureau has projected the 85 and older population in the U.S. to increase significantly, from less than 6 million in 2011 to 14 million by 2040 and 19 million by 2050. The 65 to 84 year old population is expected to more than double between 2011 and 2040. Current trends indicate that these age groups represent the majority of home and community-based health care patients.  

The aging of the population is a revenue growth driver because approximately 10% of people over the age of 65 and approximately 50% of people over the age of 85 need assistance with everyday activities. Patterson Medical believes we are well positioned to benefit from this trend by providing aids to daily living, namely dressing devices; toileting, dining, bathing aids; and grooming devices, all of which promote greater patient independence, improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment.  

       Increasing Number of PTs and OTs, Patterson Medicals Primary User Groups. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there were approximately 199,000 PTs and 109,000 OTs in the U.S. in 2010. Approximately 60 percent of PTs were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists. The remaining 40 percent of PTs was employed in home health agencies, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, physician offices and nursing homes. The majority of OTs work in hospitals, including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals. The remaining OTs work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics, schools, home health agencies, nursing homes, community mental health centers, adult day care programs, job training services and residential care facilities. The demand for PTs and OTs is expected to remain strong. The BLS estimates a growth of 33.5% for OTs between 2010 and 2020, and a growth of 39% for PTs in that same time period. Both professions are expected to grow much faster than average.  

       Increasing Frequency of Reconstructive and Implant Surgery. Another important driver of the growth in the PT market is the growing need for rehabilitation products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures, including hip and knee replacements. The worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of $5.0 billion and expected to grow between 7% and 8% annually. This growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics, as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum. Among seniors, more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants. We believe Patterson Medical is well positioned to benefit from the growth in reconstructive implants, by providing physical therapy and exercise products that help the patients return to a normal level of function.  

18  

Table of Contents 

       Volatility in Funding and Regulation. The demographic growth in aged population both in the U.S. and abroad will continue to pose funding challenges for governments. Whether private pay, Medicare, Medicaid or some other funding mechanism, the population need has been outpacing the available funds. This has resulted in governments changing funding methods, allocations, and rules to try and better match supply with demand. Although we do not directly participate in third party reimbursed (patient specific) product, the pressure on healthcare providers can have a pass through effect. Patterson Medical has pursued a diversified strategy so we do not rely too heavily on any one product category.  

International Operations  

Patterson Medicals international operations are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and are made up of Patterson Medical International (PMI) in the U.K., Kinetec and Sacedi in France, and Patterson Medical/Ausmedic in Australasia. Our international domestic operations broadly reflect the same business model as used in the North American market. In the U.K., France and Australia, operations include sales and marketing, customer service, distribution, purchasing and administration. France also includes a self contained manufacturing unit. Outside of these countries, PMI uses a network of over 200 distributors to reach its customers.  

PMI is a leading supplier of aids to daily living (ADL) and rehabilitation products in the U.K., and a significant player in the international markets. Having developed and designed many proprietary products, we are the prime source for numerous established and market leading ADL brands, including products sold under the names Homecraft, Days, and Physiomed. The PMI catalog offers a broad line of ADL, therapy, rehabilitation and pediatric products containing over 10,000 items and is circulated to PTs, OTs, loan equipment stores and private clinics, trade outlets and the general public.  

PMIs central sales and marketing strategy is to provide a one-stop shop proposition to hospitals, local government and trade customers (Dealers) throughout the U.K. Customers are reached through a combination of mail order, a 54 person sales force, telemarketing and in-market promotional and exhibition activity.  

In April 2009, PMI acquired Mobilis Healthcare, increasing our global presence. While the Homecraft catalog has historically been focused on occupational therapy, Mobilis was a complementary addition, given its strong position in the physiotherapy market.  

In June 2010, PMI acquired the rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare. The acquired DCC businesses, Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic, rank among the leaders in their overseas markets, providing assistive living products and rehabilitation equipment and supplies to hospitals, physical and occupational therapists, long-term care facilities, dealers and consumers in the U.K., continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand and other international markets.  

Kinetec consists of two operations, the manufacturing and distribution of Continuous Passive Motion machines (CPMs) for sale on a worldwide basis and the sale and distribution of Patterson Medical products in France. Products are marketed to customers through product brochures, mailings, telemarketing and a sales force that covers the French rehabilitation market. Sacedi focuses on distribution in the Therapy and Sports Medicine market segments.  

Strategy  

Our objective is for Patterson Medical to be the customers first choice for rehabilitation medical supplies and equipment in each of its chosen markets. We intend to continue Patterson Medicals growth through internal expansion and acquisitions in both rehabilitation and related products.  

19  

Table of Contents 

Emphasizing Value-Added, Full-Service Capabilities. Patterson Medical currently offers our customers a one-stop shop for products through our industry leading catalog with over 20,000 items, focused primarily on physical and occupational therapy products. Patterson Medical adds new products each year to our ever-expanding catalog and is committed to doing so long-term. Consistent with Patterson Medicals current product offering, some of these new products are branded, exclusive or self-manufactured.  

We recognize that different customer groups have very different economic, product, distribution channel requirements and treatment goals. Patterson Medical proactively attempts to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of our customers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where our capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. As such, we foresee an on-going evolution of our product offerings to meet the ever-increasing demands of our diverse customer segments.  

Improving Operating Efficiencies. Patterson Medicals proprietary products, which consist of self-manufactured products, products manufactured for Patterson Medical and products sold through exclusive distribution arrangements, represent approximately 35% of total revenues. Over the past four years, we have made investments in new sales and marketing programs as a part of our accelerated adoption of Pattersons value-added strategy, including the expansion of our sales force and the establishment of a branch office structure. We believe these investments will result in additional sales and operating efficiencies into the future.  

As of April 2012, Patterson Medical is distributing products from four shared distribution facilities that distribute products for two or all three of our operating units. As of April 2012, Patterson Medical now shares eight branch facilities with other business units, allowing the two business units to share in certain common expenses.  

Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. Patterson Medical believes we are well positioned to expand in our core markets. Our market presence, clinical understanding and close customer relationships allow us to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of our customers. We believe our market knowledge, strong vendor relationships and manufacturing capabilities will continue to drive the delivery of value-added solutions through the continual enrichment of our product mix. Additionally, we believe our broad portfolio of national accounts and commitment to expand our sales force will enhance Patterson Medicals growth and penetration within our current and new customer base.  

Patterson Medical acquired Homecraft, Mobilis, Physiomed, Days Medical, and other businesses to establish a platform for international expansion. Each business that was added has been integrated and has added to an ever expanding brand and product portfolio. The international business continues to accelerate, in terms of both product lines and geographic regions. Since the Homecraft/Kinetec transaction, Patterson Medical has added over 550 pages of new products to the catalog. The international acquisitions brought with them a proven capability to source products at very favorable costs and at high levels of quality from China, which has resulted in meaningful cost savings. We believe our business model is transferable to other countries, and are using PMI to cultivate new relationships through an enhanced product array, sales effort, distribution capabilities and catalog expertise.  

In May 2004, Patterson Medical acquired the assets of Medco Supply Company, Inc., or Medco, from NCH Corporation. With sales of approximately $60 million, Medco is one of the nations leading sports medicine distributors and is based in Buffalo, New York. In addition to Medcos sports medicine business, Medco sells first aid, safety and medical consumable products to commercial and institutional customers, as well as consumable supplies and equipment to podiatrists. The complete product offering includes approximately 10,000 SKUs that are sold through direct mail catalogs and 11 territory sales people. Medco markets to athletic trainers, schools and school nurses, daycare providers and healthcare professionals including podiatrists, chiropractors and physical therapists.  

Over the past five years, Patterson Medical has opened eighteen branch offices through acquisitions and internal start-ups in desirable locations throughout the U.S. In November 2007, Patterson Medical acquired PTOS software, a leading line of practice management software for physical therapists.  

20  

Table of Contents 

In April 2009, Patterson Medical acquired Mobilis Healthcare, a U.K.-based business with sales of $28 million. Mobilis serves 12,000 customers in the U.K. and France and owns several leading brands that are sold into its primary markets.  

In June 2010, Patterson Medical acquired the rehabilitation business of Empi Therapy Solutions, with sales of approximately $30 million.  

In June 2010, Patterson Medical acquired the rehabilitation business of DCC Healthcare, with combined sales of approximately $70 million.

Sales and Marketing  

Patterson Medical has been going through a process of establishing its brand globally to better leverage its international scope. This has led to a catalog branding transition of our acquired businesses (in various stages) including Sammons Preston in the U.S. and Canada, and Homecraft, Days, Physiomed, and Ausmedic in the remainder of the world.  

A core element of Patterson Medicals strategy is to maintain the most comprehensive single catalog of rehabilitation products and supplies. The catalog, published for over 50 years, is considered the gold standard of the industry and features the most comprehensive product offering with longstanding industry leading positions and recognized brand names. Our product management group works closely with customers, suppliers and the sales force to evaluate new products for inclusion in Patterson Medicals product offering. We add approximately 2,000 new products to the catalog each year.  

Patterson Medical has an experienced sales force, national account contracts with major customer groups, unmatched customer service within the industry and the proven ability to introduce new products each year, allowing us to compete across the entire spectrum of the rehabilitation medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products industry.  

A key priority has been the expansion of our field sales force, which has grown by more than 100 sales representatives since late in fiscal 2006 and now totals nearly 280 worldwide. New sales representatives are generally hired from the ranks of physical and occupational therapists, manufacturer representatives and others with extensive industry knowledge.  

Patterson Medical began developing a branch office structure in fiscal 2007 through a combination of internal start-ups and dealer/distributor acquisitions. Similar to Patterson Dentals branches, these offices have a showroom, commissioned sales staff and service department that provides equipment installation, repair and warranty service for equipment manufacturers. As of April 2012, eighteen branches had been established.  

Patterson Medicals U.S. national accounts group collaborates with our sales force to meet the changing needs of our expanding account base. The national accounts program is staffed by seasoned professionals who have developed a comprehensive portfolio of contracts. Furthermore, the integrated Patterson Medical organization has national contracts with major purchasing groups within each submarket, including hospitals, nursing homes and dealers.  

The rehabilitation medical supplies and equipment business is highly fragmented. No one manufacturer, distributor or customer represents a significant portion of Patterson Medicals revenue.  

To enhance the total value we bring to our customers, Patterson Medical created a value-added benefit program for its preferred customers. The Patterson Advantagesm program entitles our best customers to discount pricing and cash rebates, priority service scheduling, supply management summary reports and continuing education course discounts.  

Distribution  

Patterson Medicals distribution process centers on our ability to efficiently fill small dollar amount orders. In the U.S., over 6,000 packages ship daily from six locations. A majority of products are shipped out of two full service, shared Patterson distribution centers, one in Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, and the other in Dinuba, California. Patterson Medical also uses two additional shared facilities, in Jacksonville, Florida, and Ft. Worth, Texas, to provide local distribution of high volume items to those regions. Approximately 95% of the small packages in the U.S. ship via UPS.  

Patterson Medical uses a branch structure to more effectively distribute equipment to our customers. Large equipment can be shipped to our branches, inspected for damage, and then put on Patterson Medical trucks for consolidated delivery and installation at customers facilities.

Patterson Medicals U.S. call center operates from 7am  7pm Monday through Friday, processing in excess of 5,000 calls per day. In addition, customers can order 24 hours a day through Patterson Medicals Internet websites. The combination of in-house staff and web ordering options provides customers with 24 hours a day, seven days a week ordering capabilities. Approximately 36% of customer orders are through the web or EDI, which has decreased call center activity, allowing Patterson Medical to provide more personalized service to customers.  

Sources of Supply  

Among Patterson Medicals core strengths is our ability to obtain premier products from vendors. Our products are purchased from over 1,500 suppliers and manufacturers. Although no single supplier accounted for more than 5% of Patterson Medicals total purchases in fiscal 2012, we frequently are the largest single customer of these manufacturers. Suppliers view the ability to distribute their products through our global network positively due to our reputation, longstanding industry leading position, comprehensive catalogs, national account contracts, sales force presence and distribution capabilities. We continually work at strengthening our supplier relationships through the introduction of supplier programs.  

Competition  

We operate in the highly fragmented rehabilitation medical supplies and equipment industry. Patterson Medicals competition is generally either locally or regionally focused. Patterson Medical intends to pursue expansion opportunities when prudent in order to add products, customers and capabilities, which will further differentiate Patterson Medical from our competition.  

We believe Patterson Medical is the only national player to offer, one-stop shopping to our customers. Patterson Medicals national and international scale and purchasing power provides us with a favorable cost position and strong pricing trends relative to our competition.  

For further information on our three operating segments, and operations by geographic area, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this document and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Shared Services Initiative  

We have continued to consolidate our distribution infrastructure and business systems over the past several years. As of April 28, 2012, we have eight facilities that serve two or three of our business units. These strategically located facilities enable us to realize operating efficiencies and improve customer service.  

Our business units also share a number of sales branch office locations, enabling multiple business units to operate at one physical location. As of April 28, 2012, we have 13 shared locations, and we plan to leverage additional branch sharing between two or three business units in select markets in fiscal 2013 and beyond.  

The PTC has staff dedicated to support the technology offerings of each of our business units. Such technology product and service offerings have expanded in recent years and we will continue that focus. We support over 80,000 customers nationwide through the PTC, and strive to resolve any situation in one call, whether the question or concern involves hardware, software, computer networking or digital technology. Development of our proprietary practice management and certain of our patient education products takes place at the PTC. In addition to the PTC, technology support is provided to customers through our some of our business units sales branches, which provide network installation and customer training.
