Item 1A. Risk Factors  

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this Form 10-K, including Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any of these risks could materially affect our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could in turn materially affect the price of our common stock.  

Our contracts (revenue arrangements) with U.S. Government customers entail certain risks.  

A decline in or a redirection of the U.S. defense budget could result in a material decrease in our sales, results of operations and cash flows.  

Our government contracts and sales are highly correlated and dependent upon the U.S. defense budget which is subject to the congressional budget authorization and appropriations process. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract periods of performance may extend over many years. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract is usually partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by Congress in future fiscal years. DoD budgets are determined by factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, changing national security and defense requirements, geopolitical developments and actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for defense budgets. Any of these factors could result in a significant decline in, or redirection of, current and future DoD budgets and impact our future results of operations, including our sales and operating income growth rates.  

The total DoD budget for FY 2015 was $560 billion, a decline of 4% as compared to the FY 2014 budget due to a decrease in the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. The FY 2015 base budget remained substantially unchanged from FY 2014 at $497 billion, while the OCO budget decreased by $22 billion. The total DoD budget for FY 2016 is $581 billion, an increase of 4% compared to FY 2015. The increase is due to a base budget of $522 billion, higher by $25 billion compared to FY 2015. The FY 2016 OCO budget declined slightly to $59 billion compared to $63 billion for FY 2015.  

On February 9, 2016, the Obama Administration submitted its FY 2017 DoD Budget Request. The total FY 2017 DoD budget request is $583 billion ($524 billion base budget, $59 billion OCO), which is substantially unchanged compared to the appropriated FY 2016 DoD budget. However, the FY 2017 DoD budget was not approved or appropriated by Congress before October 1, 2016, and FY 2017 began with a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government, which expires on April 28, 2017. The CR maintains funding at the current FY 2016 appropriated level resulting in a prohibition on new program starts and multi-year contract awards. On December 23, 2016, President Obama signed the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes defense spending priorities and guidelines but does not appropriate money for those items. The NDAA largely supports the FY17 DoD Budget Request.  

Furthermore, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which suspended the debt ceiling through March 15, 2017 and raised spending caps previously enacted by Congress under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), places spending caps on defense programs. The BBA target for the DoD base budget is $551 billion for FY 2017 and $59 billion for the FY 2017 OCO funding. The BBA, however, does not change the previously enacted BCA sequestration cuts after FY 2017. The BCA specifies base budget spending caps and can only be changed through law enacted by Congress. Consequently, the U.S. Governments overall fiscal challenges remain, including uncertainties regarding BCA sequestration cuts scheduled to resume in FY 2018 and therefore, future DoD budgets and spending levels are difficult to predict. A significant decline in or redirection of U.S. military expenditures in the future, or the loss or significant reduction in U.S. Government funding of a large program in which we participate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

We rely predominantly on sales to U.S. Government entities, and the loss or delay of a significant number of our contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  

Our sales are predominantly derived from contracts (revenue arrangements) with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the U.S. Government. The loss or delay of all or a substantial portion of our sales to the U.S. Government would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 73%, or $7.6 billion, of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were made directly or indirectly to U.S.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Government agencies, including 70% to the DoD. Aggregate sales for our five largest contracts (revenue arrangements) amounted to approximately $1.5 billion, or 15% of our consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our largest contract (revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM), which is included in our Aerospace Systems segment and generated approximately 4% of our 2016 sales. Our period of performance under this contract continues through September 30, 2017. We are one of several contractors expected to bid on the re-competition of this contract and expect an award decision in the second half of 2017. 

A substantial majority of our total sales are for products and services under contracts with various agencies and procurement offices of the DoD or with prime contractors to the DoD. Although these various agencies, procurement offices and prime contractors are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors, our customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. Because of this concentration of contracts, if a significant number of our DoD contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or cancelled for budgetary, performance or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  

In addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, our backlog and future financial results may be adversely affected by:  

 •curtailment of the U.S. Government’s use of technology or other services and product providers, including curtailment due to government budget reductions and related fiscal matters; 

 •geopolitical developments that affect demand for our products and services; 

 •our ability to hire and retain personnel to meet demand for our services; and 

 •technological developments that impact purchasing decisions or our competitive position. 

The DoDs wide-ranging efficiency and better buying power initiatives, which target affordability and cost growth, could have a material effect on the procurement process and may adversely affect our existing contracts and the award of new contracts.  

Since 2010, the DoD has implemented efficiency initiatives and other best practices for procurement that are intended to reduce prices, ensure adequate competition and control costs throughout the acquisition cycle. In addition, under the Better Buying Power 3.0 (BBP) initiative, the DoD has focused on technology innovation, incentive-based cost-plus and fixed-price contracts and Company sponsored Independent research and development efforts. The U.S. Government may continue to implement changes to its procurement practices that change the way contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed and may impact our future sales, earnings and cash flows, and could affect whether, and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. Government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so.  

Our government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification. If a termination right is exercised by the government, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

Companies engaged primarily in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to certain business risks peculiar to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:  

 •suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations; 

 •terminate existing contracts; 

 •reduce the value of existing contracts; and 

 •audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. 

All of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.  

U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate our costs and performance on contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government have adjusted, and may in the future adjust, our contract related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including certain business acquisition costs, most financing costs, portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses, may not be reimbursable under U.S. Government contracts.  

As of December 31, 2016, we had a backlog of funded orders, primarily under contracts with the U.S. Government, totaling $8,896 million. As described above, the U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or terminate its contracts with us. Accordingly, most of our backlog could be modified or terminated by the U.S. Government, which would have a material adverse effect on our future sales, results of operations and cash flows.  

We may not be able to win competitively awarded contracts or receive required licenses to export our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

Our government contracts are subject to competitive bidding. We obtain many of our U.S. Government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts, such as the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract re-competition. In addition, awarded contracts may not generate sales sufficient to result in our profitability. We are also subject to risks associated with the following:  

 •the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns; 

 •the substantial time, effort and experience required to prepare bids and proposals for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us; 

 •design complexity and rapid technological obsolescence; and 

 •the constant need for design improvement. 

In addition to these risks, we are not permitted to export some of our products, and we are required to obtain licenses from U.S. Government agencies to export many of our other products and systems. Failure to receive required licenses would eliminate our ability to sell our products and systems outside the United States.  

Intense competition and bid protests may adversely affect our sales, results of operations and cash flows.  

The defense and commercial industries in which our businesses operate are highly competitive. We expect that the DoDs increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will continue to encourage new competitors to enter the market. We also expect increased competition for our products and services from other providers due to the uncertainty of future U.S. defense budgets. Furthermore, the current competitive environment has resulted in an increase of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders, which typically extends the time until work on a contract can begin. For more information concerning the factors that affect our ability to compete, see Part I — Item 1 — Business — Competition.  

We are subject to government investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, and from time to time agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. As discussed in Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we are currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations. Under U.S. Government regulations, an indictment of L3 by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in us being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. A conviction, or an administrative finding against us that satisfies the requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specific term, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Our commercial aviation products and services businesses are affected by global demand and economic factors that could negatively impact our financial results. 

The operating results of our commercial aviation products and services businesses may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production and orders, and global flying hours, which impacts air transport, regional and business aircraft utilization rates and pilot training needs. The aviation industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies and is impacted by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The results of our commercial aviation business also depend on other factors, including general economic growth, political stability in both developed and emerging markets, pricing pressures, trends in capital goods markets and changes in OEM production rates. 

Our sales to certain international customers expose us to risks associated with operating internationally.  

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to international customers, excluding our international sales made under FMS agreements directly between the U.S. Government and foreign governments, represented approximately 17% of our consolidated sales. Consequently, our businesses are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:  

 •export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports; 

 •compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. regulations; 

 •the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations; 

 •contract award and funding delays; 

 •potential restrictions on transfers of funds; 

 •currency fluctuations; 

 •import and export duties and value added taxes; 

 •transportation delays and interruptions; 

 •uncertainties arising from international local business practices and cultural considerations; 

 •sovereign government credit risk; and 

 •potential military conflicts and political risks. 

Our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. See Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations for further discussion. While we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our international business, these measures may not be adequate.  

We are subject to the risks of legal proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. 

At any given time, we are a defendant in various material legal proceedings and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, claims and assessments that have been asserted against acquired businesses, which we have assumed. Although we maintain insurance policies, these policies may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to current or future claims and may not cover the conduct that is the subject of the litigation. Desired levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. In addition, we believe that while we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us, the results of litigation can be difficult to predict, including those involving jury trials. Accordingly, our current judgment as to the likelihood of our loss (or our current estimate as to the potential range of loss, if applicable) with respect to any particular litigation matter may be wrong. A significant judgment against us, arising out of any of our current or future legal proceedings and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. For a discussion of material litigation to which we are currently a party, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

If we are unable to keep pace with rapidly evolving products and service offerings and technological change, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

The rapid change of technology is a key feature of most of the markets in which our products, services and systems oriented businesses operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Historically, our technology has been developed through customer-funded and internally funded research and development and through certain business acquisitions. We may not be able to continue to maintain comparable levels of research and development or successfully complete such acquisitions. In the past, we have allocated substantial funds to capital expenditures, programs and other investments. This practice will continue to be required in the future. Even so, we may not be able to successfully identify new opportunities and may not have the necessary financial resources to develop new products and systems in a timely or cost-effective manner. At the same time, products and technologies developed by others may render our products, services and systems obsolete or non-competitive.  

Goodwill represents a significant asset on our balance sheet and may become impaired.  

Goodwill represents the largest asset on our balance sheet, with an aggregate balance of $6,560 million at December 31, 2016. We review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and also review goodwill annually in accordance with the accounting standards for goodwill and intangible assets. The annual impairment test requires us to determine the fair value of our reporting units in comparison to their carrying values. A decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment and a related non-cash impairment charge against earnings if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill.  

Our annual impairment test at November 30, 2016, did not result in impairments to goodwill. The fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets of those reporting units by more than 20% at November 30, 2016, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment. A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could potentially trigger goodwill impairment charges and a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our annual impairment test at November 30, 2015, resulted in goodwill impairment charges of $955 million ($384 million in continuing operations and $571 million in discontinued operations). See Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets for further discussion.  

Our results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts.  

Our sales are transacted using written revenue arrangements, or contracts, which are generally fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material. For a description of our revenue recognition policies, see Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies. For information on the percentage of our total sales generated from each contract type, see Item 1 —Business — Contracts.  

Substantially all of our cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts are with the U.S. Government, primarily the DoD. Substantially all of our sales to commercial customers are transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements and are included in our fixed-price type contract sales.  

On a fixed-price type contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract.  

On a cost-plus type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contracts fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels established by our customers. On a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Additionally, the impact of revisions in profit or loss estimates for all types of contracts subject to percentage of completion accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as reduce the valuations of receivables and inventories; and in some cases, result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position.  

Pension expense and funding may fluctuate significantly because of changes in key estimates and assumptions, including discount rates and the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets, as well as our actual investment returns and regulatory actions, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  

Determining our pension expense requires significant judgment, particularly with respect to our discount rates, the assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, demographic experience and/or circumstances, our pension expense, the funded status of our plans and our cash contributions to such plans would be impacted, which could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, differences between our actual investment returns and our assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets could also impact our pension expense, the funded status of our plans and our required cash contributions to the plans. Further, our pension expense and the funded status of our plans, including required cash contributions to the plans, may be impacted by regulatory actions in any given year.  

Additionally, pension plan cost recoveries under Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) for our U.S. Government contracts occur in different periods from when pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. or when cash contributions are made. Although CAS has been revised to better align the minimum required contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, with pension plan cost recoveries under CAS, timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.  

Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.  

As a U.S. defense contractor, we have faced, and continue to face, various security threats, including, but not limited to, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information as well as the proprietary or classified information of our customers.  

Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor, deter and mitigate these threats, these procedures and controls may not be sufficient to prevent disruptions in mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential, sensitive or classified information and the corruption of data, systems or networks. Any significant operational delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our or our customers data, information systems or networks, could materially and adversely affect our financial results, damage the reputation of our products and services and require significant management attention and expense. In addition, our insurance coverage and/or indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all of the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.  

To date, cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature and increased frequency of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. The threats we face vary from those common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because we operate in the defense industry and protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, which could result in us having to spend a significant amount of money to upgrade our networks and systems and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

In the current environment, there are also numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including the use of viruses, worms or other malicious software programs and threats involving criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, terrorist attacks, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. As these risks develop and these attacks become more frequent and sophisticated, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure from cyber and other security attacks.  

21  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

We must also rely on the safeguards put in place by customers, suppliers, vendors, subcontractors, venture partners or other third parties to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions. These third parties may have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with government contractors, such as L3, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. In the event of a breach affecting these third parties, our business and financial results could suffer materially. With respect to our commercial arrangements with these third parties, we have processes designed to require that the third parties and their employees and agents agree to maintain certain standards for the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a third partys employee or agent, the breakdown of a third partys data protection processes, which may not be as sophisticated as ours, or a cyber attack on a third partys information network and systems.  

If we are unable to attract and retain key management and personnel, we may become unable to operate our business effectively.  

Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management, and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel, including employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly clearances of top-secret and above. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies for members of our management. We face competition for management and technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would damage our future prospects.  

Environmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liability.  

Our operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local as well as certain foreign environmental laws and regulations within the countries in which we operate relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations.  

New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require us to incur a significant amount of additional costs in the future and could decrease the amount of cash flow available to us for other purposes, including capital expenditures, research and development and other investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.  

Our business acquisition strategy involves risks, and we may not successfully implement our strategy.  

We opportunistically seek to acquire businesses that enhance our capabilities and add new technologies, products, services, programs, contracts and customers to our existing businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we make additional business acquisitions, we may not realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions, including sales growth, cost synergies and margin improvement. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing for business acquisitions, since such additional financing could be restricted or limited by the terms of our debt agreements or due to unfavorable capital market conditions.  

The process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Possible future business acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense and contingent liabilities, each of which could result in an increase to our already significant level of outstanding debt, as well as more restrictive covenants. Furthermore, in certain of our business acquisitions we have assumed all claims against and liabilities of the acquired business, including both asserted and unasserted claims and liabilities.  

Our spin-off of Engility could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders.  

In connection with our spin-off of Engility in 2012, we received an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Ruling stating that L3 and its shareholders would not recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the transaction. In addition, we received an opinion of counsel that the spin-off satisfied certain requirements for tax-free treatment that are not covered in the IRS Ruling; however, an opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are  

22  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. Moreover, both the IRS Ruling and the opinion of counsel are based on certain factual statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could invalidate the IRS Ruling or opinion of counsel.  

If, notwithstanding receipt of the IRS Ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, then we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off were taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Engility would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of Engility received.
