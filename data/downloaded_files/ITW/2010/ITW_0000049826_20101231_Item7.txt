ITEM 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

 INTRODUCTION  

 Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 57 countries. These businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to senior management. The Companys 60 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Transportation; Industrial Packaging; Power Systems & Electronics; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Polymers & Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other.   

 14   
 Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Companys highly decentralized operating style, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.  

 The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Companys results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues.  

 A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their businesses. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:  

       Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.   

       Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.   

       Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.   

       Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.    

 The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.  

 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 15   
 In 2010 and 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 14.4% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues increased 10.8% in 2010 versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic indices across many geographies as worldwide end markets began to recover from the global recession. North American and international base revenues increased 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively, in 2010 versus 2009. End markets associated with transportation, welding, industrial packaging and PC board/electronics showed improvement in 2010. The company anticipates continued macroeconomic improvement in 2011.  

 Revenues decreased 18.8% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Total base revenues declined 18.4% in 2009 versus 2008. Base revenues declined 21.6% and 14.9% for North American and international businesses, respectively, as both were adversely affected by the global recession and weak industrial production in related end markets throughout 2009.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased 70.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, and 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Base margins increased 360 basis points primarily due to positive leverage from the increase in base revenues. Additionally, benefits from restructuring projects were partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses in 2010 versus 2009 reflect the Companys 2009 efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively, compared to $1.0 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2010.  

 Operating income declined 44.6% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency translation, increased restructuring expenses and increased goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected    

 16   
 forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. The higher restructuring expenses reflected the Companys efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base margins 380 basis points in 2009, as the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized and selling price versus material cost comparisons were favorable. Total margins declined by 460 basis points in 2009 primarily due to the declines in base revenues, restructuring expenses and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.  

 TRANSPORTATION  

 Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 22.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base and acquisition revenues. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a North American    

 17   
 automotive aftermarket business in the second quarter of 2010. Worldwide automotive base revenues increased 30.6%. North American automotive base revenues increased 37.8% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to an increase in auto builds of approximately 39%. International automotive base revenues increased 25.1% primarily due to an increase in European auto builds of approximately 16% and increased product penetration. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted in 2009 by the economic downturn, were virtually flat over the prior year. Base revenues for the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business declined 5.4% over the prior year.  

 Revenues declined 12.2% in 2009 versus 2008 due to declines in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenues partially mitigated the base revenue decrease and were primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business in the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide automotive base revenues declined 19.0% for the full year. North American automotive base revenues declined 23.3% in 2009 due to a decline in auto builds of 32%. International automotive base revenues declined 15.4% in 2009 due to a 24% decline in European auto builds. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted by the economic downturn, declined 9.5%.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased 160.4% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and income from acquisitions. Base margins increased 620 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues described above, benefits from restructuring projects and favorable inventory obsolescence expense comparisons. During the third quarter of 2009, a $12.0 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business.  

 Operating income decreased 47.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring expenses. In addition, a $12.0 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business. The increase in restructuring expenses was primarily due to efforts to reduce costs in response to the decline in worldwide automotive production. Total operating margins declined by 470 basis points primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, partially offset by reductions in overhead expenses, favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits of restructuring projects.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 18.1% in 2010 versus 2009 due to the increase in base revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues increased 23.2% for the North American strapping businesses in 2010 largely due to an increase in steel and plastic strap volume driven by improved industrial production demand in key industries including primary metals and general industrial. The international strapping businesses increased 10.5% while worldwide protective packaging increased 16.4% over the prior period. Acquisition revenue increased primarily due to the purchase of a North American protective packaging business in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

 Revenues decreased 26.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base revenues declined 35.3% for the North American strapping businesses largely due to declines in consumable and equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals, construction and general industrial. The international strapping businesses declined 25.6% due to the global decrease in industrial production activity. Worldwide stretch and protective packaging declined 13.8% and 1.3%, respectively.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased 165.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues and lower restructuring expenses. Base operating margins increased 450 basis points primarily driven by leverage from the increase in base revenues and restructuring benefits, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses compared to 2009 increased total operating margins by 130 basis points.  

 Operating income decreased 68.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, the negative effect of currency translation and higher restructuring expenses.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 21.3% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to growth in base business. Worldwide welding base revenues increased 11.0%. North American welding base business revenues increased 15.9% as end markets began to experience recovery, particularly for heavy equipment OEMs and general manufacturers. Base business revenues for the international welding businesses increased 1.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to increased oil and gas end market activity, partially offset by declines in Asian shipyard activity. Base    

 20   
 revenues for the PC board fabrication businesses increased 71.6% as demand for consumer electronics and capital equipment increased significantly.  

 Revenues declined 31.4% in 2009 versus 2008 mainly due to declines in base revenues and the negative effect of currency translation. Revenues fell as end market demand declined across the broad spectrum of industries that this segment serves, including key end markets such as commercial construction and general industrial. The revenue decrease was partially offset by 2008 acquisitions, including a welding equipment business and a PC board fabrication business. Worldwide base welding revenues declined 32.6% in 2009. North American welding base businesses declined 36.3% while international welding base businesses declined 23.5%. Base revenues for the electronics businesses fell 29.4% while base revenues in the PC board fabrication businesses fell 44.9%, both largely due to the decline in consumer demand for electronics during 2009.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 0.7% in 2010 versus 2009 as modest base business and acquisition revenue increases were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. North American base revenues declined 1.4% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to declines in equipment sales for end markets including the lodging and casino markets. Base revenues in the service portion of the business increased 1.5% as customers continued to maintain existing equipment. International base revenues increased 2.4% for the period largely due to increased Asian and Latin American revenue offset by lower European equipment sales in 2010 versus 2009. The acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a European food equipment business in the third quarter of 2010.  

 Revenues decreased 12.8% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base business and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. The acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a European food equipment business. North American food equipment base revenues declined 11.2% while international food equipment base revenues declined 7.9% in 2009 as a result of weak demand across all worldwide markets. Base revenues for the North American institutional/restaurant businesses declined 14.7% as customers delayed equipment purchases.

 In 2010 and 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 14.7% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to an increase in base revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. European base revenues increased 8.4% in 2010 primarily due to improved market conditions. Base revenues for the Asia-Pacific region increased 3.7% as market conditions in the Australian residential construction market improved. North American base revenues increased 1.8% primarily due to modest inventory restocking and a one-time licensing agreement settlement in the second quarter of 2010 in the commercial construction business. The North American base business was negatively impacted by an 8% decline in U.S. housing starts on an annualized basis and an 18% decline in commercial construction square footage activity. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a European business in the second quarter of 2010.  

 Revenues declined 23.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American, European and Asia-Pacific regions decreased 26.7%, 22.9% and 1.1%, respectively, primarily due to weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe. U.S. housing starts declined 14% on    

 23   
 an annualized basis in 2009 versus 2008. In addition, U.S. commercial construction square footage activity fell 46% for the year versus 2008. The Asia-Pacific region outperformed other regions largely due to better customer activity in Australia and New Zealand.

 In 2010 and 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues increased 16.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due an increase in base business revenues and revenues from acquisitions. The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a consumer packaging business in the fourth quarter of 2009. Base business revenues increased 7.8% for the test and measurement businesses due to increased demand for capital equipment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Base revenues increased 6.7% in 2010 versus 2009 for the consumer packaging business due to improvement in decorating end markets. Base revenues for the industrial plastics and metals businesses improved 15.1% due to increased demand for domestic appliances. Base revenues increased 16.3% for the finishing businesses due to improved North American and international industrial end market demand.  

 Revenues decreased 13.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base business revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in revenues from acquired companies. The acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of two test and measurement businesses in 2008. Base revenues declined 15.6%, 12.2%, 21.5% and 32.5%, for the test and measurement, consumer packaging, industrial plastics and metals and finishing businesses, respectively, due to negative industrial production trends and the related impact of weak end market and capital equipment demand across the broad spectrum of industries this segment serves.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income increased 46.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the growth in base revenues and lower restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 320 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenues and benefits from past restructuring projects, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. In addition, lower restructuring costs increased total operating margins by 110 basis points. Acquisitions and divestitures diluted total operating margins by 70 basis points in 2010.  

 Operating income declined 33.5% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher restructuring expenses and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by increased income from acquisitions. Base margins decreased 180 basis points as favorable selling    

 28   
 price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. Additionally, acquisitions diluted total margins by 90 basis points.  

 AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

 Amortization expense increased to $212.9 million in 2010 and $203.2 million in 2009, versus $184.4 million in 2008, due to intangible asset amortization related to newly acquired businesses.

 The Company recorded $1.0 million of intangible asset impairment charges in 2010 versus $105.6 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges in 2009. The 2009 charges were primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was $105.6 million in 2009 versus $1.6 million in 2008. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.  

 INTEREST EXPENSE  

 Interest expense increased to $175.5 million in 2010 versus $164.8 million in 2009 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes repaid at maturity in March 2009, and lower commercial paper borrowings. Interest expense increased to $164.8 million in 2009 versus $154.5 million in 2008 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes, lower interest related to the 6.875% notes repaid at maturity in November 2008, and lower commercial paper rates and borrowings. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper was 0.2% in 2010, 0.3% in 2009 and 2.4% in 2008.  

 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  

 Other income (expense) was income of $30.8 million in 2010 versus expense of $7.4 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to gains on disposal of operating affiliates of $12.8 million (versus a loss of $6.7 million in 2009), and higher income from investments of $20.8 million (versus $4.9 million in 2009).  

 Other income (expense) was expense of $7.4 million in 2009 versus income of $4.7 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to 2009 losses on foreign currency transactions of $24.9 million, lower income from investments of $4.9 million (versus $17.0 million in 2008) and lower interest income of $17.6 million (versus $29.4 million in 2008), partially offset by the impact of the German transfer tax charge of $44.0 million in 2008.

 INCOME TAXES  

 The effective tax rate was 31.0% in 2010, 20.1% in 2009 and 28.1% in 2008. The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, signed into law in March 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by discrete tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of $85.5 million related to a global legal structure reorganization and $77.5 million related to a favorable settlement reached with the German tax authorities. In the above mentioned reorganization, the Company reorganized its ownership structure in certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2009 and made an election regarding the U.S. tax treatment of a foreign subsidiary. The Company recorded a reduction in tax expense primarily for the effect of the resulting foreign tax credits. Also during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a settlement with the German tax authorities primarily regarding the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction which resulted in the reversal of previously established tax reserves as a reduction of tax expense.  

 The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in September 2010. The proceedings result from the Companys appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioners similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the parties agreed to defer the appeal of that determination until a decision was made on the earlier years. On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia decided in the Companys favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company expects in 2011 to decrease its unrecognized tax benefits related to this matter by approximately $186 million and decrease tax expense by approximately $166 million. The Australian Tax Office has 21 days from the date the Court issued its final orders to appeal the decision.  

 See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.  

 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  

 Income from continuing operations in 2010 of $1.5 billion ($3.03 per diluted share) was 57.5% higher than 2009 income of $969.5 million ($1.93 per diluted share). Income from continuing operations in 2009 was 42.7% lower than 2008 income of $1.7 billion ($3.24 per diluted share).  

 FOREIGN CURRENCY  

 The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies increased operating revenues by approximately $153 million in 2010 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately 6 cents per diluted share. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies decreased operating revenues by approximately $653 million in 2009 and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 10 cents per diluted share.  

 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

 Loss from discontinued operations was $22.5 million in 2009 versus $172.1 million in 2008, primarily due to 2008 impairment on goodwill of $132.6 million, and a loss reserve on assets held for sale of $64.0 million partially offset by gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2008 versus losses in 2009. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.

 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

 In October 2009, new accounting guidance was issued on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The new accounting guidance amends the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable the vendor to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, (2) third-party evidence or (3) estimates. The Company will adopt the new accounting guidance on January 1, 2011 and does not expect the new guidance to materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 2011 INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE  

 Effective January 1, 2011, the Company will be eliminating the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company will report both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. Prior to this, the international fiscal reporting period began in December and ended in November.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 The Companys primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.  

 The primary uses of liquidity are:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Cash Flow  

 The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

 Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 31   
 On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period of time. Through December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased 47.9 million shares of its common stock under this program at an average price of $44.48 per share. There are approximately $871 million of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.  

 Return on Average Invested Capital  

 The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Companys operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The 460 basis point increase in ROIC in 2010 versus 2009 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 47.0%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased slightly.  

 The 530 basis point decrease in ROIC in 2009 versus 2008 was the result of after-tax operating income decreasing 38.5%, resulting from the economic downturn, while average invested capital decreased 7.5%.

 Working Capital  

 Net working capital at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Debt  

 Total debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2011 and $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. The remaining $500 million is provided under a revolving credit facility that terminates on June 15, 2012. No amounts are outstanding under these three facilities. The Companys foreign operations also have unused capacity on uncommitted facilities of approximately $318 million.  

 The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Companys targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.

 Stockholders Equity  

 The changes to stockholders equity during 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

 The Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 As of December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded income taxes payable, including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, of $459.1 million. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.  

 At December 31, 2010, the Company had open stand-by letters of credit of approximately $181 million, substantially all of which expire in 2011. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2010.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

 These critical accounting policies are as follows:  

 Realizability of Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Companys businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 34   
 In addition, for approximately half of the U.S. inventories, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method due to the effects of inflation.  

 Collectibility of Accounts Receivable  The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.  

 Depreciation of Plant and Equipment  The Companys U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:  

   Buildings and improvements      150% declining balance   

   Machinery and equipment      200% declining balance    

 The majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations.  

 Income Taxes  The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Companys deferred and other tax balances are based on managements interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income and effect of the Companys various tax planning strategies. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.  

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Companys business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Companys total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its 60 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets.  

 In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. This constituted a change in method of applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is preferable. The change was made to better align the timing of the Companys goodwill impairment assessment with the Companys annual business planning and forecasting process.  

 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to continuing operations were $1.0 million in 2010, $105.6 million in 2009 and $1.6 million in 2008. The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the relative carrying values and fair values of the reporting units related to these impairment charges.   

 35   
 As of December 31, 2010, the Company had goodwill and intangible assets of $6.6 billion allocated to its 60 reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 60 reporting units that have goodwill and intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and therefore have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Companys 80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill and intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately $3 million to $740 million, with the average amount equal to $110 million.  

 Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Companys global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. Pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participants years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.  

 The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $32 million.  

 The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2010 and will be 8.0% for 2011. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on how this rate is determined.
