ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

American Airlines Group

Background

As previously discussed, the Merger was consummated on December 9, 2013. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated results include American and American Eagle for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the results of US Airways Group for the 23 days ended December 31, 2013.

Following the Merger, AAG began moving toward operating under the single brand name of "American Airlines" through its mainline operations, American and US Airways. Until a single operating certificate is issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the operational integration is complete, American and US Airways will continue to operate as separate airlines. This process is expected to take 18-24 months. Through its operating subsidiaries, including the operating subsidiaries of US Airways Group, AAG is the largest airline in the world as measured by revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs). The Company has primary hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. As of December 31, 2013, the combined airline operated nearly 6,700 daily flights to 339 destinations in 54 countries. As of December 31, 2013, American and US Airways operated 965 mainline jets. American continues to be provided with regional feed by American Eagle and third-party regional carriers and US Airways continues to be provided with regional feed by Piedmont, PSA and third-party regional carriers. As of December 31, 2013, the Company’s regional subsidiaries and the third-party regional carriers that provide it with regional feed operated approximately 519 regional jets and approximately 40 turboprops. 

See Part I, Item 1. Business - "Chapter 11 Reorganization" and "Merger" for more information related to our emergence from Chapter 11 and Merger.

Year in Review

The U.S. Airline Industry 

In 2013, the U.S. airline industry experienced year-over-year growth in passenger revenues driven by strong demand for air travel. 

In its most recent data available, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported that annual U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields increased 3.8% and 2.0%, respectively, as compared to 2012. With respect to international versus domestic performance, Airlines for America reported that the Atlantic and Latin America markets outperformed domestic markets in year-over-year growth in passenger revenues while the Pacific market experienced year-over-year declines in passenger revenues. 

Throughout 2013, jet fuel prices continued to follow the price of Brent crude oil more closely than the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. On average, fuel costs were down slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012. The Brent crude oil average daily spot price was $109 in 2013 which approximates the average daily spot price in 2012. However, on a daily basis, prices continued to be volatile. Throughout 2013, daily spot prices fluctuated between a high of $119 per barrel in February to a low of $97 per barrel in April and closed the year at $110 per barrel on December 31, 2013. 

While the U.S. airline industry is currently benefiting from a favorable revenue environment and moderating fuel prices as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these factors. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business" and "Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity."

American Airlines Group

In 2013, we realized operating income of $1.4 billion and a net loss of $1.8 billion. We completed our merger with US Airways Group on December 9, 2013, and accordingly these results include results of US Airways Group for the 23 day post-merger period, December 9, 2013, to December 31, 2013. The information in the following paragraph and under "Revenue", "Fuel", "Capacity" and "Cost Control" excludes the post-merger results of US Airways Group.

53

Excluding the results of US Airways Group, we recognized operating income of $1.6 billion in 2013 which compares to operating income of $148 million in 2012, a $1.4 billion improvement. This year-over-year improvement was driven by growth in operating revenues of $957 million resulting from strong demand for air travel and a $471 million reduction in operating expenses primarily as a result of steps taken in our Chapter 11 restructuring. Our standalone net loss was $1.6 billion in 2013 which compares to a net loss of $1.9 billion in 2012. Our net loss was impacted by the recognition of net special charges of $2.8 billion and $1.7 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively, principally the result of reorganization expenses related to the recognition of allowed claims. See "AAG's Results of Operations" below for a reconciliation of the impact on American Airlines Group of the post-merger results of US Airways Group and net special charges.

Revenue

Mainline and regional passenger revenues increased $864 million, or 4.0%, as compared to 2012. The growth in revenues was driven by a 1.7% increase in revenue passenger miles and a 2.3% increase in yield, as total capacity increased 1.3% as compared to 2012. Our mainline and regional passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was 13.38 cents in 2013, a 2.7% increase, as compared to 13.03 cents in 2012. 

Fuel

Mainline and regional fuel expense was relatively flat at $8.7 billion in each of 2013 and 2012. The average mainline and regional price per gallon of fuel was $3.09 in 2013 as compared to an average price per gallon of $3.20 in 2012, a decrease of 3.3%. The decrease in fuel price per gallon was offset by a 3.1% increase in consumption due in part to increased capacity and a shift from turboprop to regional jet aircraft.

Capacity

Total system capacity for 2013 increased 1.3% primarily due to our ongoing fleet replacement programs where we are replacing older aircraft with larger gauge, more modern aircraft. 

Cost Control

AAG is committed to maintaining a low cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel. Our mainline costs per available seat mile (CASM) excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing decreased 0.40 cents or 4.5% from 8.90 cents in 2012 to 8.50 cents in 2013. This decrease was primarily due to cost reductions achieved in our Chapter 11 restructuring to become more cost competitive.

The table below details our mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and excluding special items and profit sharing provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

54

Customer Service

We are committed to consistently deliver safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. Our 2013 operating performance was negatively impacted by more severe summer weather conditions as compared to 2012. We reported the following operating statistics to the DOT for American's mainline operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Percentage of reported flight operations arriving on time as defined by the DOT.

(b) Percentage of scheduled flight operations completed.

(c) Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.

(d) Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.

Liquidity Position

As of December 31, 2013, AAG's total cash and short-term investments was $10.3 billion, of which $1.0 billion was restricted. Additional detail is provided in the table below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers' compensation obligations.

The improvement in our liquidity is due primarily to the acquisition of US Airways Group which had a cash and short-term investments balance of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2013 as well as proceeds from our $1.9 billion Term Loan Facility, which we entered into in June 2013. We also obtained a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. To date, we have not drawn any amounts under the revolving credit facility.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization and the related Merger Agreement, the Company issued a portion of its shares of common stock at emergence to certain employees. In December of 2013, the Company withheld the issuance of a portion of these shares and instead used approximately $300 million of cash in satisfaction of employee tax obligations.

As of December 31, 2013, approximately $783 million of our cash and short-term investments balances were held in foreign bank accounts, of which $710 million was held as Venezuela bolivars. 

The business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $710 million of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of 6.04 bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently 11.80 to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local 

55

currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors "We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control" for additional discussion on currency risks.

2014 Outlook

We have taken significant actions in the last year, including the completion of our restructuring and merger with US Airways Group, to restore our competitiveness. Although it is difficult to predict the price of oil or the strength of the economy, we believe that our 2013 financial results are evidence of the strong foundation we have in place and can build on.

56

AAG's Results of Operations 

In 2013, we realized operating income of $1.4 billion and a net loss of $1.8 billion. We completed our merger with US Airways Group on December 9, 2013, and accordingly the results of US Airways Group are included for the 23 day post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Excluding the results of US Airways Group, we recognized operating income of $1.6 billion and a net loss of $1.6 billion. Excluding the effects of net special items we recognized standalone net income of $1.2 billion. In 2013 we experienced growth in revenues due to the strong demand for air travel and a reduction in operating costs as a result of steps taken in our Chapter 11 restructuring.

In 2012, we realized operating income of $148 million and a net loss of $1.9 billion. Excluding the effects of net special items we recognized a net loss of $130 million.

In 2011, we realized an operating loss of $1.0 billion and a net loss of $2.0 billion. Excluding the effects of net special items we recognized a net loss of $1.1 billion. We filed for Chapter 11 on November 29, 2011.

The following table presents our 2013 standalone Operating income (loss), Net loss, net special charges and net income excluding special charges: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)To conform to current year presentation, certain operating revenue and expenses in prior years have been reclassified. As a result, prior year amounts may not agree to the amounts previously reported. See Note 5 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information.

(2)We are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines.

The components of our net special charges, excluding the results of US Airways Group for the 23 day post-merger period, are as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012, special charges consisted of $387 million of severance and related charges and write-off of leasehold improvements on aircraft and airport facilities that were rejected during the Chapter 11 process. 

In 2011, special charges consisted primarily of $725 million related to the impairment of certain aircraft and gates, $31 million of non-cash charges related to certain sale/leaseback transactions, and a $43 million revenue reduction as a result of a decrease in the breakage assumption related to the AAdvantage frequent flyer liability.

57

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012, special charges consisted of a $280 million benefit resulting from a settlement of a commercial dispute.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following discussion of operating revenues is for AAG on a standalone basis and excludes the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 in order to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.

Total operating revenues in 2013 were $25.8 billion as compared to $24.9 billion in 2012, an increase of $957 million or 3.8%, which was driven by strong demand for air travel. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We derived approximately 60% of our total passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 40% from international operations (flights serving international destinations). Additional information regarding our domestic and international PRASM and capacity, excluding the impact of the Merger, is presented below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following discussion of operating expenses and mainline operating expenses per ASM is for AAG on a standalone basis and excludes the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 in order to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.

Total operating expenses in 2013 were $24.2 billion as compared to $24.7 billion in 2012, a decrease of $471 million, or 1.9%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $941 million, or 15.1% decrease in salaries, wages and benefits due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan as well as effects related to the freezing of American's pension plans in 2012. This decrease was offset in part by a $190 million, or 34.4% increase in aircraft rent as a result of new aircraft deliveries in 2013 as we continue our fleet renewal program, a $69 million, or 6.5% increase in selling expenses due to higher passenger revenues and other operating expenses, which increased $225 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to higher costs associated with outsourced services and enhanced customer product offerings. See detailed explanations below relating to other changes in operating expenses.

61

Mainline Operating Expenses per ASM:

Our mainline CASM, excluding the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period, decreased 0.53 cents, or 3.7%, from 14.20 cents in 2012 to 13.67 cents in 2013. Excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, our mainline CASM decreased 0.40 cents, or 4.5%, from 8.90 cents in 2012 to 8.50 cents in 2013, while mainline capacity increased 1.2%. 

The table below sets forth the major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and excluding special items and profit sharing provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expense per ASM are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Regional Operating Expenses:

Total regional expenses increased $84 million, or 2.8%, in 2013 to $3.1 billion from $3.0 billion in 2012. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a $44 million, or 4.4%, increase in fuel costs and a $40 million, or 2.0% increase in other costs on a 1.8% increase in capacity. The increase in fuel costs was driven by higher fuel consumption due to the transition from turboprop to regional jet aircraft.

62

Nonoperating Income (Expense)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following discussion of interest expense is for AAG on a standalone basis and excludes the results of US Airways Group for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 in order to make the year-over-year comparison more meaningful.

 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased $204 million, or 32.3%, to $836 million in 2013 from $632 million in 2012 primarily due to special charges of $157 million to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan.

Other nonoperating expense, net of $89 million in 2013 consists principally of net foreign currency losses of $56 million. Other nonoperating income in 2012 consisted principally of a $280 million special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute partially offset by net foreign currency losses.

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, which were filed in November of 2011. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on AAG's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)In exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion.

(2)Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note 2 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.

(3)Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of $180 million, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.

63

(4)The Plan allows unsecured creditors receiving Preferred Stock a conversion discount of 3.5%. Accordingly, the Company recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.

Income Tax Benefit

During 2013, the Company generated a pre-tax loss of approximately $2.2 billion and other comprehensive income before tax of approximately $1.5 billion. In accordance with accounting standards, the Company must record a net zero tax provision which is required to be allocated between operating loss and Accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this guidance required the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of $538 million in operating results, offset by a $538 million charge to other comprehensive income for the year. See Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating income and Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded a similar non-cash income tax benefit of $569 million in operating results in 2012, offset by a $569 million charge to other comprehensive income for the year, as discussed in Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.

The Company has evaluated the realization of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the principles provided in ASC 740. In connection with AMR’s fourth quarter 2013 emergence from bankruptcy and related accounting for the acquisition of US Airways, the Company determined that an additional valuation allowance of approximately $214 million is required to reduce the Company’s deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company believes to be more likely than not to be realized. This $214 million results in a charge to tax expense in continuing operations for the period. The Company’s assessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets is based primarily on the future reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences. The Company is not relying on projections of future income for the realization of deferred tax assets. See Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information regarding deferred taxes. 

The Company has also recorded an income tax expense credit of approximately $22 million in 2013 resulting from the Company’s anticipated election under Section 3081 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), allowing corporations a refund of certain research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

2012 Compared to 2011 

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating revenues in 2012 were $24.9 billion as compared to $24.0 billion in 2011, an increase of $876 million or 3.7%, driven by the strong revenue demand environment. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

64

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We derived approximately 60% of passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 40% from international operations (flights serving international destinations). Additional information regarding our domestic and international RASM and capacity is presented below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating expenses in 2012 were $24.7 billion as compared to $25.0 billion in 2011, a decrease of $309 million or 1.2%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $370 million or 48.9% decrease in special items, net. In 2011, we incurred a $725 million charge related to the impairment of certain aircraft and gates. See Note 6 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for more information relating to special items. See detailed explanations below relating to other changes in operating expenses.

65

Mainline Operating Expenses per ASM:

Our mainline CASM was relatively flat year-over-year, decreasing 0.05 cents, or 0.4%, from 14.25 cents in 2011 to 14.20 cents in 2012. Excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, our mainline CASM decreased 0.09 cents, or 1.0%, from 8.99 cents in 2011 to 8.90 cents in 2012, while mainline capacity decreased 1.1%. 

The table below sets forth the major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and excluding special items and profit sharing provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

Regional Operating Expenses:

Total regional expenses of $3.0 billion were relatively flat and only increased $19 million, or 0.6% as compared to 2011.

Nonoperating Income (Expense)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest decreased $179 million, or 22.1% to $632 million in 2012 from $811 million in 2011 primarily as a result of the Company's Chapter 11 Cases as described in Note 2 in Part II, Item 8A.

Other nonoperating expense, net of $221 million in 2012 consists principally of a $280 million special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute, which was offset in part by foreign currency losses of $41 million.

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, which were filed in November of 2011. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on AAG's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note 2 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.

Income Tax Benefit

During 2012, the Company generated a pre-tax loss of approximately $2.4 billion and other comprehensive income before tax of approximately $1.6 billion. In accordance with accounting standards, the Company's net zero tax provision is required to be allocated between operating loss and accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this guidance required the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of $569 million in operating results, offset by a $569 million charge to other comprehensive income for the year. See Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating income and Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company did not record a net tax provision (benefit) associated with its net loss for 2011 due to the Company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.

American's Results of Operations

In 2013, American recognized operating income of $1.5 billion, which compares to operating income of $82 million in 2012 and constitutes a $1.5 billion improvement that was driven by growth in operating revenues resulting from strong demand for air travel. American's net loss was $1.5 billion in 2013 which compares to a net loss of $1.9 billion in 2012. American's net loss was impacted by the recognition of net special charges of $2.8 billion and $1.7 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively. To conform to current year presentation, certain operating revenues and expenses in prior years have been reclassified. As a result, prior year amounts may not agree to the amounts previously reported. See Note 4 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information.

In 2011, American realized an operating loss of $1.2 billion and a net loss of $2.0 billion. American's 2011 net loss was impacted by the recognition of $915 million in net special charges.

The table below presents American's net special charges (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012, special charges consisted of $386 million of severance and related charges and write-off of leasehold improvements on aircraft and airport facilities that were rejected during the Chapter 11 process. 

In 2011, special charges and other items consisted primarily of $725 million related to the impairment of certain aircraft and gates, $31 million of non-cash charges related to certain sale/leaseback transactions, and a $43 million revenue reduction as a result of a decrease in the breakage assumption related to the AAdvantage frequent flyer liability. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012, special charges consisted of a $280 million benefit resulting from a settlement of a commercial dispute.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating revenues in 2013 were $25.8 billion as compared to $24.8 billion in 2012, an increase of $935 million or 3.8%, which was driven by strong demand for air travel. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

American derived approximately 60% of its total passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 40% from international operations (flights serving international destinations). Additional information regarding American's domestic and international PRASM and capacity is presented below:

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating expenses in 2013 were $24.2 billion as compared to $24.7 billion in 2012, a decrease of $517 million or 2.1%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $941 million, or 15.2% decrease in salaries, wages and benefits due to the results of voluntary and involuntary terminations in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan, as well as effects related to the freezing of American's pension plan in 2012. This decrease was offset in part by a $189 million, or 34.2% increase in aircraft rent as a result of new aircraft deliveries in 2013 as American continues its fleet renewal program, a $69 million, or 6.5% increase in selling expenses due to higher passenger revenues and a $239 million, or 8.9% increase in other operating expenses primarily due to higher costs associated with outsourced services and enhanced customer product offerings. See detailed explanations below relating to other changes in operating expenses.

Regional Operating Expenses

Total regional expenses increased $25 million, or 0.8%, in 2013 to $3.1 billion from $3.0 billion in 2012. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a $42 million, or 4.2%, increase in fuel costs driven by higher fuel consumption due to the transition from turboprop to regional jet aircraft, partially offset by a decrease in other regional expenses.

Nonoperating Income (Expense)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased $67 million, or 10.6% to $700 million in 2013 from $633 million in 2012 primarily due to special charges of $68 million to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan.

Other nonoperating expense, net of $84 million in 2013 consists principally of net foreign currency losses of $55 million. Other nonoperating income in 2012 consisted principally of a $280 million special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute partially offset by net foreign currency losses.

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases, which were filed in November of 2011. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on American's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)In exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion.

(2)Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note 2 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.

(3)Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, American recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of $180 million, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.

(4)The Plan allows unsecured creditors receiving Preferred Stock a conversion discount of 3.5%. Accordingly, American recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court. 

Income Tax Benefit

During 2013, American generated a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.9 billion and other comprehensive income before tax of approximately $1.5 billion. In accordance with accounting standards, American must record a net zero tax provision which is required to be allocated between operating loss and accumulated other comprehensive income. Application of this guidance required the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of $538 million in operating results, offset by a $538 million charge to other comprehensive income for the year. See Note 10 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding the allocation of income tax benefit to Operating income and Accumulated other comprehensive income. American recorded a similar non-cash income tax benefit of $569 million in operating results for 2012, offset by a $569 million charge to other comprehensive income for the year, as discussed in Note 10 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

American has evaluated the realization of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the principles provided in ASC 740. In connection with AMR’s fourth quarter emergence 2013 from bankruptcy and related accounting for the acquisition of US Airways, American determined that an additional valuation allowance of approximately $214 million is required to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes to be more likely than not to be realized. This $214 million results in a charge to tax expense in continuing operations for the period. American’s assessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets is based primarily on the future reversal of American's existing taxable temporary differences. American is not relying on projections of 

71

future income for the realization of deferred tax assets. See Note 10 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding deferred taxes. 

American has also recorded an income tax expense credit of approximately $30 million in 2013 resulting from its anticipated election under Section 3081 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (as extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012), allowing corporations a refund of certain research and alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards in lieu of applicable bonus depreciation on certain qualifying capital investments.

2012 Compared to 2011 

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating revenues in 2012 were $24.8 billion as compared to $24.0 billion in 2011, an increase of $868 million or 3.6%, driven by the strong revenue demand environment. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating expenses in 2012 were $24.7 billion as compared to $25.1 billion in 2011, a decrease of $368 million or 1.5%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $370 million or 48.9% decrease in special items, net. In 2011, American incurred a $725 million charge related to the impairment of certain aircraft and gates. See Note 5 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for more information relating to special items. See detailed explanations below relating to other changes in operating expenses.

Regional Operating Expenses:

Total regional expenses decreased $50 million, or 1.6%, in 2012 to $3.0 billion from $3.1 billion in 2011. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a $135 million, or 6.3% decrease in other regional expenses, partially offset by a 6.3% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel to $3.23 in 2012 from $3.04 in 2011.

Nonoperating Income (Expense)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest decreased $39 million, or 5.8% to $633 million in 2012 from $672 million in 2011 primarily as a result of the Company's Chapter 11 Cases as described in Note 2 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

Other nonoperating expense, net of $223 million in 2012 consisted of a $280 million special credit related to the settlement of a commercial dispute, which was offset in part by foreign currency losses of $41 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Assets

As of December 31, 2013, AAG's total cash, short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments was $10.3 billion, of which $1.0 billion was restricted. This includes American's total cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion ($702 million restricted) and US Airways Group's cash and short-term investments of $3.6 billion ($333 million restricted). Additional detail is provided in the table below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support projected workers compensation obligations.

As of December 31, 2013, approximately $783 million of American's cash and short-term investments balances were held in foreign bank accounts, of which $710 million is held as Venezuela bolivars. 

The business environment in Venezuela has been challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluation, high inflation and governmental restrictions, including currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $710 million of our unrestricted cash balance was held as Venezuelan bolivars, valued at a weighted average rate of 6.04 bolivars to the dollar. The period of time to exchange those funds into dollars and repatriate them has been increasing and is presently more than a year. On January 23, 2014, the Venezuelan government issued a regulation to implement a new system for determining the exchange rate based on the result of limited periodic sales of dollars known as Sicad auctions (currently 11.80 to the dollar based on the February 21, 2014 Sicad auction) for repatriation of income from future ticket sales, and introduced new procedures for approval of conversion and repatriation of local currency. The government also enacted a new law effective February 19, 2014 that authorizes additional methods of exchanging Venezuelan bolivars at rates other than the controlled base rate of 6.3 to the dollar or the existing Sicad auction rate, but the regulations necessary to implement the law are still pending and it is not clear at this point whether or how the new methods may impact the pending balances of Venezuelan bolivars held by airlines. We are working with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. Further, the current, devalued rates may have an ongoing adverse effect on our reported results if we are unable to fully adjust prices on flights to and from Venezuela, of which there can be no assurance. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors "We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control" for additional discussion on currency risks.

Our unrestricted short-term investment portfolio consists of a variety of what we believe are highly liquid, lower risk instruments including money market funds, government agency investments, repurchase agreements, short-term obligations, corporate obligations, bank notes, certificates of deposit and time deposits. Our objectives for our investment portfolio are (1) the safety of principal, (2) liquidity maintenance, (3) yield maximization and (4) the full investment of all available funds. Our risk management policy further emphasizes superior credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining investments in our portfolio and enforce limits on the proportion of funds invested with one issuer, one industry or one type of instrument. We regularly assess the market risks of our portfolio.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $675 million and $1.3 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $610 million. This year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of US Airways Group's net cash used in operating activities of $327 million, for the post-merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013, and our emergence from bankruptcy in 2013 which triggered cash payments for certain liabilities.

Commitments

Significant Indebtedness 

As of December 31, 2013, AAG and American had $16.8 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, in long-term debt and capital leases (including current maturities and before debt discount). Our significant indebtedness includes the following agreements: 

Credit Facilities (American)

On June 27, 2013, American and AAG entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.9 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities). As of December 31, 2013, American had borrowed $1.9 billion under the Term Loan Facility. The Credit Facilities are secured obligations of American and guaranteed by AAG. The Revolving Facility provides that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have letters of credit issued thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of up to $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

Upon consummation of the Merger, US Airways Group and US Airways joined the Credit Facilities as guarantors. Following the joinder, certain minimum dollar-thresholds under the negative and financial covenants in the Credit Facilities were automatically increased. The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility mature on June 27, 2019 and June 27, 2018, respectively, unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties. The Term Loan Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility.

Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time, with a premium of 1.00% applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following December 27, 2013. Mandatory prepayments at par of term loans and revolving loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with American's covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, if a "change of control" (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs, American will, absent an amendment or waiver, be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the Revolving Facility.

The Credit Facilities bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at American's option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%, with respect to the Term Loan) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is 3.00% for borrowings under both the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including liens on certain route authorities to operate between certain specified cities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants". 

The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. The Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional 

78
indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions. 

Senior Secured Notes (American)

In March 2011, American issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2016 (the Senior Secured Notes) guaranteed on an unsecured basis by AAG. In connection with the closing of the Merger, US Airways and US Airways Group entered into a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 9, 2013, pursuant to which US Airways and US Airways Group became guarantors. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011. As is customary for financings of this nature, the indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of events of default under the related indenture. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes are secured by certain route authorities, airport landing and takeoff slots, and rights to use or occupy space in airport terminals, in each case that American uses to operate non-stop services between certain airports and American is required maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding amounts under the Senior Secured Notes as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants."

American, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2013, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2014, American, at its option, may redeem (1) up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.5% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and (2) during any 12-month period, up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If American sells certain assets or if a "change of control" (as defined in the indenture) occurs, American must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at prices specified in the indenture.

The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes includes covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends. The indenture for the Senior Secured Notes also contains events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-default to certain material indebtedness of American. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.

2013 Citicorp Credit Facility (US Airways)

US Airways Group and certain other subsidiaries of US Airways Group are guarantors of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement dated as of May 23, 2013. In connection with the closing of the Merger, AAG and American entered into a joinder to the 2013 Citicorp credit facility loan agreement pursuant to which AAG and American became guarantors under such agreement. 

The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility consists of $1.0 billion of tranche B-1 term loans (Tranche B-1) and $600 million of tranche B-2 term loans (Tranche B-2). Voluntary prepayments may be made by US Airways Group at any time, with a premium of 1.00% applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following January 16, 2014. Mandatory prepayments of the term loans are required to the extent necessary to comply with US Airways Group’s covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of collateral. In addition, under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement, if a "change of control" (as defined in the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement) occurs, US Airways will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay the outstanding loans in full together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment.

As of the date of this filing, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility bears interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at US Airways' option, LIBOR (subject to a of 0.75%) plus an applicable LIBOR margin. The applicable LIBOR margin is 2.75% for Tranche B-1 and 2.25% for Tranche B-2.

Tranche B-1 and Tranche B-2 mature on May 23, 2019 and November 23, 2016, respectively (unless otherwise extended by the applicable parties), and each is repayable in annual installments to be paid on each anniversary of the closing date in an amount equal to 1.00% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the loans with any unpaid balance due on the maturity date of the respective tranche.

The obligations of US Airways under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility are secured by liens on certain route authorities, certain take-off and landing rights at certain airports and certain other assets of US Airways. US Airways is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility as more fully described below in "Collateral Related Covenants."

79
The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, (a) require AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain unrestricted liquidity of not less than $2.0 billion, with not less than $750 million held in accounts subject to control agreements, and (b) restrict the ability of US Airways Group, its subsidiaries party to the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, AAG and American to make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain acquisitions, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into certain hedging transactions, and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility agreement contains events of default customary for similar financings, including a cross-default provision to certain other material indebtedness of US Airways and certain of its affiliates. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.

See Note 9 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on all indebtedness as of December 31, 2013. 

Collateral Related Covenants

Certain of American's and US Airways’ debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require American and US Airways under their respective financing agreements to periodically appraise the collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, American or US Airways is required, as applicable, to subject additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, with premium (if any), or pay additional interest on the related indebtedness, as described below.

Specifically, American is required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on a periodic basis on two financing transactions: (1) the Senior Secured Notes and (2) the Credit Facilities, and US Airways is required to meet a collateral coverage test on a periodic basis on the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, in each case, as described below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)With respect to spare parts, one physical appraisal and one desktop appraisal are required in each fiscal year.

As of December 31, 2013, the Company, American and US Airways were in compliance with the most recently completed collateral coverage test for the Senior Secured Notes, Credit Facilities and the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility, as applicable.

Credit Ratings

The following table details our credit ratings as of December 31, 2013:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*The credit agency does not rate this category for the respective entity.

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. See Note 9 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on all indebtedness as of December 31, 2013.

Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments

We have definitive purchase agreements with Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers for the acquisition of an aggregate of 617 mainline and regional aircraft. We also have agreements for 44 spare engines to be delivered in 2014 and beyond. Under all of our aircraft and engine purchase agreements, our total future commitments as of December 31, 2013 are expected to be as follows (approximately, in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We do not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2016: sixteen Airbus 320 family aircraft, 10 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and 18 Boeing 787 aircraft. In addition, we do not have financing commitments in place for the majority of aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2017 and beyond. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - "We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully."

Credit Card Processing and Other Reserves

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to us soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor may have liability if we do not ultimately provide the air travel. Our agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a "holdback") equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. Certain of our agreements provide that these holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the processing companies, up to the estimated liability for future air travel purchased with the respective credit cards, upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. The amount that the processing companies may withhold also varies as a result of changes in financial risk due to seasonal fluctuations in ticket volume. Additional holdback requirements will reduce our liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks. 

81
Pension Funding Obligation

We are required to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of ERISA, the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012. In 2013 we contributed $489 million to our defined benefit pension plans, which covered minimum contributions for periods prior to our Chapter 11 filing and periods thereafter (see Note 2 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 2 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information), as well as certain interest and penalty interest due with respect to contributions for pre-petition periods.

American's minimum required contribution to our pension plans for 2014 is $120 million. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Upon expiration of these rules, our funding obligations are likely to increase materially.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 8 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8B of this report.

Special Facility Revenue Bonds 

Certain special facility revenue bonds were issued by certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as operating leases. In accordance with various orders of the Bankruptcy Court and/or the Plan, special facility revenue bond claims in connection with the Alliance Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, and certain special revenue bond claims in relation to the John F. Kennedy International Airport were treated as general unsecured claims. In addition, pursuant to the Plan, the agreements with respect to the special facility revenue bonds relating to the Tulsa International Airport have remained in full force and effect, in accordance with their original terms and conditions, and constitute ongoing obligations of American or AAG, as reflected in the particular agreement. Approximately $498 million of the special facility revenue bonds (with total future payments of approximately $715 million as of December 31, 2013) are guaranteed by AAG, American, US Airways Group or US Airways. Approximately $112 million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to repurchase the bonds in 2014. Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling accruals or are considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.

Pass-Through Trusts

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with pass-through trust certificates, or enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs), issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance our acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American and US Airways to raise the financing for several aircraft at one time and place such funds in escrow pending the purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American and US Airways.

Each trust covered a set amount of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced within a specific period of time. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the funds in escrow to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes were issued, at American or US Airways' election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leased the aircraft to American or US Airways. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, 

82
nor are they guaranteed by, AAG, American, US Airways Group or US Airways. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American or US Airways and, in certain instances, are guaranteed by AAG or US Airways Group as applicable. As of December 31, 2013, $6.0 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

With respect to leveraged leases, American or US Airways evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American or US Airways concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American and US Airways generally are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American or US Airways to absorb decreases in value or entitles American or US Airways to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American and US Airways do not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Each lease does have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American or US Airways to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term; the fixed price approximates an estimate of the aircraft's fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American and US Airways do not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American and US Airways concluded it was not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American and US Airways account for their EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American and US Airways' total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2013.

Income Taxes

We experienced a statutory "ownership change" on December 9, 2013 as defined for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. When a company undergoes such an ownership change, Section 382 limits the company’s future ability to utilize any NOL generated before the ownership change and certain subsequently recognized "built-in" losses and deductions, if any, existing as of the date of the ownership change. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where an ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We anticipate taking advantage of these certain special rules which will permit approximately $9.0 billion of our federal NOL carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. At December 31, 2013, the Company inherited the US Airways Group approximate $1.6 billion of NOLs ($1.4 billion of which is subject to Section 382 limitation due to the ownership change) to reduce the Company’s future taxable income. The majority of American Airlines Group Inc.’s NOLs are expected to be available to reduce federal taxable income in the calendar year 2014. The Company’s ability to utilize any new NOL arising after the ownership change is not affected.

(2)For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current rate at December 31, 2013.

(3)Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities—which are supported by operating leases executed by American or US Airways—are guaranteed by AAG, US Airways Group, American and/or US Airways. The special facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions discussed above are included in this table based on lease payment terms rather than their mandatory tender provision date. See Note 9 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information.

(4)See Note 8 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information about the Company's obligations.

See Note 8 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information.

(6)Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily information technology related support. The Company has made estimates as to the timing of certain payments primarily for construction related costs. The actual timing of payments may vary from these estimates. Substantially all of the Company's purchase orders issued for other purchases in the ordinary course of business contain a 30-day cancellation clause that allows the Company to cancel an order with 30 days notice.

(7)Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and other postretirement benefit payments based on estimated payments through 2023. See Note 13 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.

(8)Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts that represent a variable expense (based on levels of operation) or where short-term cancellation provisions exist.

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions

In light of AAG’s significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, AAG and its subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks and natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, aircraft and aircraft engines and parts could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, the Credit Facilities, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and certain of our other financing arrangements 

84

contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements.

In the past, the Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash position and other considerations, the Company may continue to take such actions.

We have reserved shares of AAG Common Stock and Preferred Stock to be distributed to holders of unsecured claims that were not settled prior to emergence and have not yet been resolved.

Basis of Presentation

See Note 5 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in part II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 5 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.

Passenger revenue

Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. AAG's air traffic liability was $4.4 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively and American's air traffic liability was $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel was to be provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in results of operations during the period in which the evaluations are completed.

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment along with other fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets such as certain domestic take-off and landing rights, customer relationships, marketing agreements and tradenames. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Amortizing intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 5 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to American's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.

We record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of future market and operating conditions, including our current fleet plan and considerations of any modifications thereto. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

87

The majority of American's and US Airways' fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate. We have one consolidated reporting unit.

Goodwill is measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative screen and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. As AAG acquired US Airways on December 9, 2013, an impairment test was unnecessary in 2013 as no events or circumstances were identified to indicate the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain international and domestic take-off and landing rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate. Indefinite-lived assets are measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative screen and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. The fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily based on available market pricing for comparable assets along with estimates of discounted future cash flows, using assumptions based on historical results adjusted to reflect management's best estimate of future market and operating conditions. Changes in industry capacity, demand for air transportation, regulatory considerations such as "open skies" arrangements, and other factors can significantly impact the fair value of our indefinite-lived assets. Based upon our annual testing, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived assets in 2013.

Business Combination Measurements

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we estimated the fair value of US Airways’ assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the Merger, December 9. 2013. These fair value adjustments did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us in the Merger. Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values, as well as changes in other assumptions could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill. 

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income and cost approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, other than certain long-term debt assumed in the Merger. The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized to estimate the fair value of US Airways’ aircraft and operating leases. The market approach used includes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets, as well as pricing guides and other sources. We considered the current market for the aircraft, the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets, among other factors. We also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take-off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets, including customer relationships, marketing agreements, certain international route authorities, and the US Airways tradename. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The fair value of the Dividend Miles frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles which were expected to be redeemed at December 9, 2013. The weighted average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel.

Frequent flyer programs

AAG currently operates two frequent traveler programs, American's AAdvantage and US Airways' Dividend Miles. These programs award mileage credits to passengers who fly on American and oneworld carriers and US Airways and Star Alliance carriers, respectively, as well as certain other partner airlines that participate in the programs. Effective March 31, 2014, US Airways will join the oneworld alliance and exit the Star Alliance. At that point, frequent travel reciprocity will be discontinued for many Star Alliance airlines. Mileage credits can also be earned through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in our respective loyalty programs. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American, US Airways or other participating partner airlines, in which case we pay a fee. 

We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members earn mileage credits by flying on American, US Airways or our regional affiliates. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level required to redeem an award. Additionally, outstanding mileage credits are subject to expiration if unused. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These estimates are based on historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the statement of operations as a part of passenger revenue.

The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. Incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food, and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In addition, we also include in the determination of incremental cost the amount of certain fees related to redemptions expected to be collected from AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. These redemption fees reduce incremental cost. No profit or overhead margin is included in the accrual of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon our 12-month historical average of such costs. 

We applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger and therefore recorded the liability for outstanding US Airways mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. As of December 31, 2013, the liability for outstanding mileage credits expected to be redeemed for future travel awards for US Airways under the Dividend Miles program was $932 million and is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Frequent flyer liability. This liability will be reduced as miles are redeemed and new miles earned will be recorded as a liability based on the incremental cost method discussed above.

As of December 31, 2013, the liability for outstanding mileage credits for the AAdvantage program was $580 million and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within frequent flyer liability.

American and US Airways also sell frequent flyer program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. Historically, we have used the residual method of accounting to determine the values of each component as there had not been a material modification to any significant agreements since our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" on January 1, 2011.

During the fourth quarter, American and Citibank amended their current agreement which resulted in a material modification of the terms of the arrangement. Also, in connection with our acquisition of US Airways on December 9, 2013, a material modification occurred on all of US Airways' agreements in connection with the Merger. Therefore, subsequent to the amendments of these arrangements, we will apply the relative selling price method to determine the values of each deliverable. Under the relative selling price approach, we identified five revenue elements for the co-branded credit card agreements with Citibank and Barclays: the transportation component; use of the American and US Airways’ brand including access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; lounge access; and baggage services (together excluding "the transportation component", the "marketing component"). 

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component 

89

is deferred based on its relative selling price and amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.

The marketing component represents services provided to our business partners and relates primarily to the use of American’s and US Airways’ logo and tradenames along with access to customers lists of AAdvantage and Dividend Miles members. The marketing services are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale.

Upon application of the relative selling price method in the fourth quarter for American’s Citibank modification, we reduced our travel component liability and recorded Other Revenue of approximately $31 million. As a result of the change in the marketing component value when the relative selling price method is applied, American and US Airways now defer less revenue per mile sold.

For American’s agreements where there has not been a material modification, we continue to apply the residual method.

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, AAG had $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively and American had $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded as Frequent flyer liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately $834 million, $725 million and $761 million, respectively.

A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the liability. A 1% increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have a $23 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2013. A 10% increase or decrease in the assumed price per gallon of fuel would have a $21 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2013.

A change to the estimated fair value of the transportation component could have a significant impact on revenue. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the transportation component would have an approximately $89 million impact on revenue recognized in 2013. 

The number of AAdvantage and Dividend Miles one way travel award redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2013, was approximately 6.1 million and 1.8 million respectively, representing approximately 8.2% and 3.5% of American and US Airways’ total mainline and regional RPMs during that period, respectively. We believe displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given our load factors and our ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory.

Pensions and retiree medical and other benefits

We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and, starting in 2007 and (iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:

Income taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

ITEM 7(A).QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

AAG's Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to AAG's Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for accounting policies and additional information regarding derivatives.

Aircraft Fuel

The Company's operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in the Company's business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate the Company's airline, even a relatively small increase in the price of fuel can have a material adverse aggregate effect on the Company's costs and liquidity. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years with market spot prices ranging from a low of approximately $1.87 per gallon to a high of approximately $3.38 per gallon during the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013. In order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, we trade and ship fuel and maintain fuel storage facilities to support our flight operations. US Airways Group does not hedge price risk of fuel. American has historically hedged the price risk of fuel costs through the use of hedging contracts, which consist primarily of collars (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold put option) and call spreads (consisting of a purchased call option and a sold call option). Heating oil, jet fuel and crude oil are the primary underlying commodities in the hedge portfolio. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% increase in the December 31, 2013 and 2012 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2014 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an increase to American's Aircraft fuel and related taxes of approximately $1.1 billion in 2014, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2013, and assumes our fuel hedging program remains effective. Such an increase would have resulted in an increase to American's projected Aircraft fuel and related taxes of approximately $718 million in 2013, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2012. 

As of January 2014, the Company had cash flow hedges covering approximately 19% of its estimated consolidated 2014 fuel requirements. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2012, the Company had hedged approximately 21% of its estimated 2013 fuel requirements. The Company's consumption hedged for 2014 is capped at an average price of approximately $2.91 per gallon of jet fuel. One percent of the Company's estimated 2014 fuel requirement is hedged using call spreads with protection capped at an average price of approximately $3.18 per gallon of jet fuel. Eighteen percent of the Company's estimated 2014 fuel requirement is hedged using collars with an average floor price of approximately $2.62 per gallon of jet fuel. The cap and floor prices exclude taxes and transportation costs. 

Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. We assess, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. In doing so, we use a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel. We also monitor the actual dollar offset of the hedges' market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be "highly effective" if the R-squared is greater than 80% and the dollar offset correlation is within 80% to 125%. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if we decide to discontinue the hedging relationship. 

We have not entered into any fuel hedges since the Effective Date and our current policy is not to do so. Assuming we continue to pursue this policy, once our existing hedge contracts expire or otherwise terminate, we will be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.

Foreign Currency

We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American currencies, particularly Venezuela and Argentina. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program related to our foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. Due to our foreign-denominated revenues exceeding our foreign-denominated expenses, a uniform 10% relative strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from 

92

December 31, 2013 and 2012 levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency exposure would result in an increase in our Total non-operating expense, net of approximately $199 million and $164 million, for the years ending December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and does not address any exposure to foreign currency held on our balance sheet.

Interest

Our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash and short-term investments, and our interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments. Our largest exposure with respect to variable rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We had variable rate debt instruments representing approximately 26% and 19% of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If our interest rates average 10% more in 2013 than they did at December 31, 2013, our interest expense would increase by approximately $17 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately $2 million. In comparison, at December 31, 2012, we estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2012 than they did at December 31, 2012, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $7 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately $2 million.

Additional information regarding our debt obligations as of December 31, 2013 is as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In accordance with ASC 852, the Debtors recorded interest expense only to the extent (1) interest was paid during the Chapter 11 Cases or (2) it was probable that the Bankruptcy Court would allow a claim in respect of such interest. Interest expense AAG recorded on its Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled $856 million and $632 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. AAG's contractual interest expense (including interest expense that is associated with obligations in liabilities subject to compromise) during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 totaled $928 million and $766 million, respectively.
