We divide our businesses into two principal segments, Investment Management and Investment Services. We have an Other segment, which includes credit-related services, the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our investment securities portfolio), our equity investment in Wing Hang Bank Limited, our equity interest in ConvergEx Group, business exits and corporate overhead.

See the “Available Information” section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon. 

We were formed as a bank holding company (“BHC”) and have our executive offices in New York, New York. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.

On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation (“Mellon Financial”) merged into BNY Mellon, with BNY Mellon being the surviving entity (the “merger”).

Our two principal banks are:

•The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state chartered bank, which houses our Investment Services businesses, including Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, Treasury Services, Broker-Dealer and Advisor Services as well as the bank-advised business of Asset Management.

•BNY Mellon, National Association (“BNY Mellon, N.A.”), a nationally-chartered bank, which houses our Wealth Management business. 

Our two principal U.S. banks engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. 

We have four other U.S. bank and/or trust companies concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our asset management businesses, along with our Pershing businesses, are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.

Each of our bank and trust companies are subject to regulation by the applicable banking regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.

BNY Mellon’s branches and subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).  The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (“BNYMSA”) is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the National Bank of Belgium. BNYMSA has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; London, England; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg and Paris, France. BNYMSA’s activities are in the Investment Services segment of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management.

Primary Subsidiaries

Exhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K presents a list of BNY Mellon’s primary subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 2013.

Supervision and Regulation

Information on BNY Mellon’s supervision and regulation obligations can be found in the “MD&A — Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report. That information is incorporated into this item by reference. 

Competition

BNY Mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Investment Management business competes with asset management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies. We may compete with these firms and companies domestically or internationally. Our Investment Services business competes with domestic and foreign financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives services, depositary receipt services and cash management services and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, lending limits and customer convenience.

Many of our competitors, with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies, banks and trust companies, are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “MD&A — Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report and, as a result, may have a 

competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects.

Many broad-based financial services firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage and asset management, which may enhance their competitive position. 

As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients. We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor, and, for this reason, have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area. The ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor, and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this. For additional discussion regarding competition, see “MD&A — Risk Factors – We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Employees

At Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries had approximately 51,100 employees.

Pursuant to the merger, BNY Mellon assumed Mellon Financial’s obligations under this Replacement Capital Covenant, and BNY Mellon amended this Replacement Capital Covenant on Sept. 11, 2012. In this section, we refer to this Replacement Capital Covenant as so amended as the “2006 RCC” and to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the Preferred Securities together as the “2006 Securities”. 

6 BNY Mellon 

BNY Mellon agreed in the 2006 RCC for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of its long-term indebtedness for money borrowed, called “Covered Debt”, that on or before Sept. 5, 2056:

•BNY Mellon will not repay, redeem or repurchase, and will cause the 2006 Trust not to repay, redeem or repurchase, any of the 2006 Securities, with limited exceptions, unless:

◦BNY Mellon has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to do so if such approval is then required under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules; and

◦the principal amount repaid or the applicable redemption or repurchase amount does not exceed specified percentages of the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds that BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries have received since Sept. 11, 2012 from the issuance of certain securities specified in the 2006 RCC that, generally described, based on the standards in effect at the time the 2006 RCC was originally adopted would have been expected to receive equity credit at the time of sale or issuance equal to or greater than the equity credit attributed to the 2006 Securities based on such standards at the time of such repayment, redemption or repurchase; and

•BNY Mellon will not pay any interest that has been deferred on the 2006 Securities other than out of the net proceeds of common stock or certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that is subject to a replacement capital covenant similar to the 2006 RCC, subject to certain limitations, and BNY Mellon will not redeem interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities that it has elected to capitalize, as permitted by the terms of such securities, except with the proceeds raised from the issuance or sale of common stock or rights to purchase common stock.

On June 19, 2007, Mellon Financial entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant in connection with (i) the issuance by Mellon Capital IV (the “2007 Trust”) of 500,000 of its 6.244% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Preferred Capital Securities, or “Normal PCS” (together with Stripped PCS and Capital PCS issued pursuant to the terms of the Normal PCS, the “PCS”), having a stated amount of $1,000 per Normal PCS and $500,000,000 in the aggregate and (ii) the 

issuance by Mellon Financial to the 2007 Trust of $500,000,000 of its 6.044% Junior Subordinated Notes, or “Junior Notes”, and a 1/100th interest in a Stock Purchase Contract under which the 2007 Trust was obligated to purchase, and Mellon Financial was obligated to sell, one share of Mellon Financial’s Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series L, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, which, pursuant to the merger, became an obligation to purchase Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, $100,000 liquidation preference per share, of BNY Mellon (the “Preferred Stock”). The 2007 Trust sold the Junior Notes in a remarketing on May 21, 2012 and purchased the Preferred Stock on June 20, 2012. Pursuant to the merger, BNY Mellon assumed Mellon Financial’s obligation under this Replacement Capital Covenant, and BNY Mellon amended this Replacement Capital Covenant on May 8 and Sept. 11, 2012. In this section, we refer to this Replacement Capital Covenant as so amended as the “2007 RCC”, to the 2006 RCC and the 2007 RCC together as the “RCCs” and to the Preferred Stock and the PCS collectively as the “2007 Securities”.

BNY Mellon agreed in the 2007 RCC for the benefit of persons who buy, hold, or sell a specified series of its long-term indebtedness for money borrowed, called “Covered Debt”, that on or before the “Termination Date”, as defined in the 2007 RCC (anticipated to be June 20, 2022):

•BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries will not redeem or repurchase any of the 2007 Securities with limited exceptions, unless:

◦the applicable redemption or repurchase amount does not exceed specified percentages of the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds that BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries have received since Sept. 11, 2012 from the issuance of common stock or other securities specified in the 2007 RCC that, generally described, based on the standards in effect at the time the 2007 RCC was originally adopted would have been expected to receive equity credit at the time of issuance equal to or greater than the equity credit attributed to the 2007 Securities at the time of such redemption or repayment.

BNY Mellon 7

The series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is Covered Debt under the RCCs as of the date of this Form 10-K is BNY Mellon’s 5.50% subordinated notes due Nov. 15, 2018, which have CUSIP No. 585515AE9. Each series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is Covered Debt, including BNY Mellon’s 5.50% subordinated notes due Nov. 15, 2018, will cease to be Covered Debt on the earliest of (i) the date that is two years prior to the final maturity date or the defeasance of such series of notes and (ii) if BNY Mellon or a subsidiary elects to redeem or repurchase such series of notes in whole or in part and after giving effect to such redemption or repurchase the outstanding principal amount of such series is less than $100,000,000, the applicable redemption or repurchase date. Each RCC includes provisions under which BNY Mellon will then identify a new series of its long-term indebtedness for money borrowed to become the Covered Debt benefiting from such RCC.

The full text of each RCC, as amended and restated, is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and 99.2 to our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012. The description of each RCC set forth above is qualified by reference to its full text.
