Overview of Business  

We are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life, with manufacturing facilities in 36 countries and products sold in more than 150 countries. Our products are sold under such well-known brands as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. We have four reportable global business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, K-C Professional & Other, and Health Care. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 8, Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In managing our global business, we believe that developing new and improved products, managing commodity and currency risks, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, and responding effectively to current and developing global economic environments are important to our long-term success. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors.  

       Product innovationPast results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. We rely on our ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and maintain category leadership. In order to introduce new or improved products, the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed. Innovation spending is directed towards new or improved personal care, tissue, industrial wipers, safety and health care products and nonwoven materials.  

       Commodity and foreign currency risksWe are exposed to changes in commodity prices, and as a multinational enterprise, we are also exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material effect on our results of operations.  

       Competitive environmentPast results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely-advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, price, product innovation, quality and performance, and marketing and distribution capabilities.  

We increased promotional and strategic marketing spending in 2009 and 2010 to support new or improved product introductions, further build brand equity and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of our products in the market. We expect competition to continue to be intense in 2011.  

       Market sharesAchieving leading market shares in our principal products in key categories has been an important part of our past performance. We hold the number 1 or 2 share positions in more than 80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands.  

       Cost controlsTo maintain or improve our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste, and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in our business segments. Our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of pulp, oil and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes.  

       Global economic environmentOur business and financial results continue to be adversely affected by global economic uncertainty and market volatility. Although it has become more challenging to predict

Overview of 2010 Results  

       Net sales increased 3.3 percent because of an increase in sales volumes, net selling prices and improvements in product mix.  

       Operating profit decreased 1.8 percent, and net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark and diluted earnings per share decreased 2.2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The benefits of the net sales increase, cost savings, a decrease in pension expense, and the effect of the 2009 organization optimization severance and related charges, were more than offset by inflation in key input costs, increased marketing, research and general expenses, and the charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela.  

       Cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 21 percent.  

Results of Operations and Related Information  

This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2010 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2010 results to 2009, and 2009 results to 2008.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Personal care net sales in North America increased about 4 percent due to an increase in sales volumes and net selling prices of 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively. The sales volume increases resulted from higher sales of feminine care and adult incontinence products, including benefits from innovation in the U by Kotex, Poise and Depend brands and higher sales of training pants and baby wipes, partially offset by lower sales of Huggies diapers.  

In Europe, personal care net sales decreased about 2 percent due to unfavorable currency effects of 2 percent and a decrease in net selling prices of 1 percent, partially offset by increases in sales volumes of 1 percent.  

In K-Cs International operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa (K-C International), net sales increased about 6 percent driven by a 5 percent increase in sales volumes and a 1 percent favorable currency effect. The growth in sales volumes was broad-based, with particular strength in Asia and Latin America, excluding Venezuela.  

       Consumer tissue net sales in North America decreased 1 percent as an increase in net selling prices of 2 percent and improvements in product mix of 1 percent were more than offset by a sales volume decline of 4 percent. Sales volumes were down low single-digits in bath tissue and double-digits in paper towels, primarily as a result of continued consumer trade-down to lower-priced product offerings.  

In Europe, consumer tissue net sales decreased 2 percent due to unfavorable currency effects of 2 percent and a decrease in sales volumes of 2 percent, partially offset by an increase in net selling prices of 2 percent.  

In K-C International, consumer tissue net sales increased about 8 percent due to an increase in net selling prices of 4 percent, favorable currency effects of 2 percent and improvements in product mix of 1 percent. Increases in net selling prices were broad-based, with particular strength in Latin America and Russia.  

       K-C Professionals net sales in North America increased 3 percent due to higher net selling prices of about 2 percent and favorable currency effects of 1 percent. Volume comparisons benefited from the Jackson Products, Inc. (Jackson) acquisition in 2009 and growth in the wiper and safety categories, while washroom product volumes declined in a continued challenging economic environment. In Europe, sales of K-C Professional products decreased 1 percent, as an increase in sales volumes of 3 percent was more than offset by unfavorable currency effects of 3 percent and lower net selling prices of 1 percent.  

       The increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to a 9 percent benefit from the acquisition of I-Flow Corporation (I-Flow) in late November 2009, as well as volume increases in

     other medical devices, which were more than offset by declines in supplies, including the impact from increased face mask demand in 2009 related to the H1N1 influenza virus.  

Commentary:  

2009 versus 2008  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Personal care net sales in North America decreased about 1 percent due to a decline in sales volumes of 1 percent and unfavorable currency effects of 1 percent, partially offset by higher net selling prices of more than 1 percent. The higher net selling prices resulted from price increases implemented during 2008, net of 2009 increased promotional activity primarily for Huggies diapers to match competitive actions. The sales volume declines resulted from lower sales of training pants, due to category weakness, and modestly lower volumes for Huggies diapers. These declines were partially offset by higher volumes for K-Cs adult incontinence brands, including benefits from innovation of Depend products.  

In Europe, personal care net sales decreased about 10 percent as unfavorable currency effects of 12 percent and decreased net selling prices of 2 percent were partially offset by increased sales volumes of 4 percent. The volume increase was driven by growth of Huggies diapers in Central Europe and in our four core marketsthe U.K., France, Italy and Spain.  

In K-C International, net sales increased about 5 percent driven by a more than 11 percent increase in net selling prices and 4 percent increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a 10 percent unfavorable currency effect. The growth in net selling prices was broad-based, with particular strength throughout Latin America and in South Korea, Russia, and South Africa. Unfavorable currency effects were primarily in South Korea, Russia, Australia and Latin America.  

       Consumer tissue net sales in North America decreased 2 percent as an increase in net selling prices of 2 percent was offset by a sales volume decline of about 4 percent. The higher net selling prices were primarily attributable to price increases in all categories implemented during 2008, net of increased promotional activity to match competitive actions. Sales volumes were down low single-digits in facial tissue and double-digits in paper towels, primarily as a result of focusing on improving revenue realization and some consumer trade-down to lower-priced product offerings.  

In Europe, consumer tissue net sales decreased almost 14 percent due to unfavorable currency effects of 11 percent, a decrease in sales volumes of 2 percent and a decrease of net selling prices of 1 percent. The lower sales volumes were primarily because of reduced sales of bathroom tissue due to some consumer trade-down to lower-priced product offerings.  

In K-C International, consumer tissue net sales decreased 3 percent, as an increase in net selling prices of 7 percent and improvements in product mix of 1 percent were more than offset by unfavorable currency effects of 8 percent and lower sales volumes of 3 percent. The increase in net selling prices

 resulted from price increases implemented in most markets in 2008, net of 2009 increased promotional activity. Unfavorable currency effects were primarily attributable to South Korea, Russia, Australia and Latin America.  

       Economic weakness and high unemployment levels in North America and Europe continued to affect K-C Professionals categories in 2009. In North America, sales decreased 4 percent, due to a decrease in sales volumes of 6 percent (which is net of an approximate 4 percent benefit from the acquisition of Jackson in April 2009), partially offset by higher net selling prices of about 3 percent. In Europe, sales of K-C Professional products decreased 16 percent, due to a decrease in sales volumes of 9 percent (which is net of an approximate 1 percent benefit from the Jackson acquisition) and unfavorable currency effects of 9 percent, partially offset by higher net selling prices of 3 percent.  

       The increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to broad-based growth across several categories including exam gloves and apparel and a 2 percent benefit from the acquisition of I-Flow in late November 2009. In addition, approximately 35 percent of the total gain in health care volume for the year was attributable to increased global demand for face masks, a result of the H1N1 influenza virus.

 (a) Includes inflation in raw materials, energy and distribution costs.  

 (b) Includes the effect of the 2009 organization optimization initiative charges and related benefits. Consolidated also includes the effect of the charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela in 2010.  

       Consolidated operating profit decreased $52 million or 1.8 percent compared to the prior year. The benefits of increases in net sales, cost savings of $370 million, and a decrease in pension expense of about $120 million, were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs of about $790 million, and increased marketing, research and general expenses, which included higher strategic marketing spending of about $100 million, and increases related to I-Flow and to support future growth in K-C International. Comparisons were also impacted by the effect of the organization optimization initiative charges of $128 million in 2009 and related benefits in 2010, and a $98 million charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela. Operating profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 14.0 percent from 14.8 percent last year.  

       Operating profit for the personal care segment increased 1.4 percent as higher sales volumes, higher net selling prices, and cost savings were mostly offset by inflation in key input costs, increased marketing, research and general expenses and unfavorable currency effects. In North America, operating profit increased due to cost savings, higher net selling prices, increased sales volumes, and favorable currency effects, partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and increased marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit increased due to cost savings partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and decreases in net selling prices. Operating profit in K-C International decreased as higher sales volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency effects, primarily in Venezuela, increases in marketing and general expenses and inflation in key input costs.  

       Consumer tissue segment operating profit decreased 10.3 percent. Increases in net selling prices, cost savings and lower general expenses were more than offset by inflation in key input costs, unfavorable currency effects, lower sales volumes and higher marketing expenses. Operating profit in North America decreased as increases in net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by inflation in key input costs, lower sales volumes and higher marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit increased as cost savings, higher net selling prices and lower general expenses were partially offset by inflation in key input costs. Operating profit in K-C International decreased as higher net selling prices and improvements in product mix were more than offset by inflation in key input costs, unfavorable currency effects, primarily in Venezuela, and increased marketing, research and general expenses.

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products increased 0.9 percent as higher net selling prices and cost savings were mostly offset by inflation in key input costs and unfavorable currency effects.  

       Operating profit for the health care segment decreased 28.7 percent. The benefit of higher sales volumes and cost savings were more than offset by higher selling and general expenses, including ongoing I-Flow litigation-related expenses, inflation in key cost inputs and lower net selling prices.  

Organization Optimization Initiative  

In June 2009, we announced actions to reduce our worldwide salaried workforce by approximately 1,600 positions. These actions resulted in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $128 million in 2009. Related savings from this initiative were approximately $80 million in 2010 and $55 million in 2009. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on costs incurred for the initiative.  

Other (income) and expense, net  

Other (income) and expense, net for 2010 includes a $79 million charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela. In addition, Other (income) and expense, net includes currency transaction losses of $20 million in 2010 and $110 million in 2009. Included in 2009 was approximately $73 million of currency transaction losses related to operations in Venezuela.  

Commentary:  

2009 versus 2008  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes raw materials deflation and energy and distribution variations.  

 (b) Includes organization optimization severance and related charges and cost savings.  

 (c) Strategic cost reduction charges of $60 million were included in 2008.  

       Consolidated operating profit increased $278 million or 10.9 percent from the prior year. The benefits of higher net selling prices, cost savings of about $240 million and deflation in key cost components totaling approximately $675 million, were partially offset by lower sales volumes, negative currency effects of about $355 million, severance and related costs of $128 million, increased pension expense of about $155 million, higher operating costs and increased strategic marketing spending. Operating profit as a percent of net sales increased to 14.8 percent from 13.1 percent in 2008. Charges in 2008 of $60 million for strategic cost reductions, which were a part of a multi-year plan completed in 2008 to improve our competitive position, are not included in the results of the business segments.

(Continued)  

       Operating profit for the personal care segment increased 5.5 percent as higher net selling prices, materials and other cost deflation, and cost savings were partially offset by organization optimization severance charges, unfavorable currency effects, higher operating costs and increased marketing expense. In North America, operating profit increased due to higher net selling prices, materials and other cost deflation, and cost savings, tempered by organization optimization severance charges and increased marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit declined as increased sales volumes were more than offset by lower net selling prices and organization optimization severance charges. Operating profit in K-C International increased as higher net selling prices and the benefits of volume growth were only partially offset by unfavorable currency effects.  

       Consumer tissue segment operating profit increased 22.5 percent. Materials and other cost deflation, higher net selling prices and cost savings were partially offset by lower sales volumes, increased selling and marketing spending, organization optimization severance charges and negative effects of production down-time which occurred earlier in 2009, in part to drive inventory reductions. Operating profit in North America increased due to the same factors that affected the overall segment. In Europe, operating profit increased as materials and other cost deflation were only partially offset by unfavorable currency effects, lower net selling prices, and lower sales volumes. Operating profit in K-C International increased as higher net selling prices and materials and other cost deflation were partially offset by increased marketing expenses, unfavorable currency effects and lower sales volumes.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products increased 8.4 percent as higher net selling prices and materials and other cost deflation were partially offset by organization optimization severance charges, lower sales volumes, negative effects of production down-time, in part to drive reductions in inventory, increased general expense, partially as a result of the Jackson acquisition, and unfavorable currency effects.  

       Operating profit for the health care segment increased 70.6 percent. The benefit of higher sales volumes, materials cost deflation, manufacturing production efficiencies and cost savings were partially offset by higher selling expenses, as a result of the I-Flow acquisition, and lower net selling prices.  

Other (income) and expense, net  

Other (income) and expense, net for 2009 includes currency transaction losses of $110 million, an increase of $92 million over 2008, partially offset by additional favorable settlements of value-added tax matters in Latin America. Approximately $73 million of the currency transaction losses in 2009 related to operations in Venezuela.  

Additional Income Statement Commentary  

2010 versus 2009  

       Interest expense decreased due to a lower average level of debt and lower average interest rates. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt activity.  

       Our effective income tax rate was 30.9 percent for 2010 compared with 29.0 percent for 2009. The increase was primarily due to nondeductible currency losses resulting from the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela and changes in U.S. tax legislation, including a charge related to the Medicare Part D subsidy.  

       Our share of net income of equity companies increased by $17 million primarily due to higher earnings at Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (KCM). KCMs U.S. dollar earnings benefited from the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar by about 7 percent on average for the year, increases  

22  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

     in sales volumes and net selling prices of 3 percent each, and cost savings. These benefits were partially offset by inflation in key input costs, primarily pulp.  

       The average number of common shares outstanding declined in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to share repurchases throughout 2010 under our share repurchase program.  

2009 versus 2008  

       Interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates and a lower average level of debt. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt activity.  

       Our effective income tax rate was 29.0 percent for 2009 compared with 27.0 percent for 2008. The increase was primarily due to favorable audit activity in 2008 relating to prior years and currency effects in Latin America and Asia-Pacific.  

       Our share of net income of equity companies declined by $2 million primarily due to unfavorable currency effects affecting our investment in KCM. Despite higher selling prices and sales volumes, KCMs U.S. dollar results were negatively affected as the Mexican peso results for 2009 were translated into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates that were 18 percent weaker versus the U.S. dollar in 2009 than in 2008. Also affecting the year-over-year comparisons were currency transaction losses in 2008 on its more than $300 million of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that were refinanced into Mexican peso liabilities in 2009. The currency transaction losses reduced our share of KCMs net income by approximately $23 million in 2008.  

       Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $29 million primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Andean affiliate in January 2009. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.  

       The average number of common shares outstanding declined in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to share repurchases throughout 2008 under our share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased under the program during 2009.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Capital is total debt and redeemable securities of subsidiaries plus stockholders equity.  

Cash Flow Commentary:  

Cash provided by operations decreased $737 million primarily due to a lower level of working capital improvements as compared to the prior year, partially offset by decreased pension plan contributions.

Contractual Obligations:  

The following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Obligations Commentary:  

       Projected interest payments for variable-rate debt were calculated based on the outstanding principal amounts and prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2010.  

       Returns on redeemable preferred securities reflect required return payments through the next redemption election date by instrument class. See Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

       The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp, and utilities. Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.  

       The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.  

We will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $400 million to $500 million to these plans in 2011. Pension contributions are not included in the table.  

The table does not include future payments that we will make for other postretirement benefit obligations. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $68 million in 2011 to more than $74 million by 2020.  

Accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing of future payments.  

Deferred taxes, noncontrolling interests and payments for direct pension plan benefits are also not included in the table.  

A consolidated financing subsidiary has issued two classes of redeemable preferred securities. The holder of the securities can elect to have the subsidiary redeem the first class in December 2011 and the second class in December 2014 and each seven-year anniversary thereafter. In December 2010, the holder of the securities  

24  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 caused the subsidiary to elect to redeem the first class of preferred securities in December 2011. As a result, we will repay approximately $500 million in 2011, which is included in the above table. In the event the holder of the securities does elect to have the remaining class of preferred securities redeemed at the next respective redemption date, we would be required to repay approximately $500 million in 2014. This amount has not been included in the table. See Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these securities.  

Investing Commentary:  

       During 2010, our capital spending was $964 million.  

Financing Commentary:  

       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, total debt and redeemable securities was $6.5 billion.  

       We repurchase shares of Kimberly-Clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. During 2010, we repurchased $800 million of our common stock through a broker in the open market. In 2011, we plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares through open market purchases, subject to market conditions.  

       In 2006, we issued $200 million of dealer remarketable securities that have a final maturity in 2016. In 2010, the dealer exercised its option to remarket the securities for another year and sold the securities to third parties until the next remarketing date in December 2011. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on these securities.  

       During third quarter of 2010, we issued $250 million 3.625% notes due August 1, 2020. We used the net proceeds to repay floating rate notes that were due July 30, 2010.  

       At December 31, 2010, we had a $1.33 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in September 2012. Under the arrangement, the revolving credit facility may be increased to $1.77 billion. We maintain the revolving credit facility to manage liquidity needs in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is constrained for any reason. We did not borrow any amounts under the revolving credit facility in 2010.  

       Our short-term debt as of December 31, 2010 was $79 million (included in Debt payable within one year on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and consisted of short-term bank financing. The average month-end balance of short-term debt for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $320 million, and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $256 million. These short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. The level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the business operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as dividends and income taxes.  

       On February 3, 2011, we issued $250 million of 3.875% notes due March 1, 2021 and $450 million of 5.30% notes due March 1, 2041. Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including purchasing shares of company common stock pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs, funding of pension plans and redeeming outstanding commercial paper.  

       Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the maturity date of a $397 million monetization loan was extended from January 31, 2011 to January 31, 2014.  

       In 2003, the Venezuelan government enacted currency restrictions, which have affected the ability of K-C Venezuela to obtain U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate to pay for significant imports of finished goods, raw materials and services to support its operations. These exchange restrictions have  

25  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

     negatively affected K-C Venezuela because it has had to meet its foreign currency needs at rates which are substantially unfavorable to the official exchange rate. During the second quarter of 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its currency exchange regulations that include a volume limitation that is insufficient to convert K-C Venezuelas bolivar-denominated cash into U.S. dollars to pay for the historical levels of U.S. dollar-denominated imports to support its operations.  

K-C Venezuela represented 1 percent and 3 percent of Consolidated Net Sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2009, K-C Venezuela represented 1 percent of Consolidated Operating Profit and Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark. In 2010, Operating Profit and Net Income Attributable to K-C at our Venezuelan subsidiary were both negative as a result of the $98 million in pretax ($96 million after tax) adjustment recorded as a result of adopting highly inflationary accounting in the first quarter of 2010. While K-C Venezuelas results of operations for the remainder of the year did not have a material impact on our 2010 consolidated results, they did negatively impact sales volume comparisons and we expect this trend to continue in 2011. At December 31, 2010, our net investment in K-C Venezuela was $175 million.  

Management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs in the foreseeable future.  

Variable Interest Entities  

We have interests in the financing and real estate entities discussed in Item 8, Notes 2, 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The entities described in Item 8, Notes 2 and 9 are consolidated, as are certain of the real estate entities described in Note 14. The nonconsolidated real estate entities do not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension and other postretirement benefits, retained insurable risks, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets, the qualitative analyses used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and loss contingencies. These critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Promotion and Rebate Accruals  

Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between us and our trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific

(Continued)  

 product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $352 million and $364 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $353 million and $365 million, respectively.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension Benefits  

We have defined benefit pension plans in North America and the United Kingdom (the Principal Plans) and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in these countries. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded.  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $133 million in 2010 compared with $251 million for 2009. Pension expense in 2009 included a curtailment charge of about $21 million related to the freeze of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 7.96 percent in 2010 compared with 8.17 percent in 2009 and will be 7.14 percent in 2011. The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. In setting this assumption, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class, current asset allocation and historical long-term market performance.  

The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the Principal Plans was 8.19 percent in 2010 compared with 8.47 percent in 2009 and will be 7.35 percent in 2011. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 60 percent with equity managers, with expected long-term rates of return ranging from 9 to 10 percent, and about 40 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return ranging from 5 to 6 percent. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Long-term rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary.  

Pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. The variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a Calculated Value was used for plan assets. As of December 31, 2010, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $2.2 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension

 liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required.  

The discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligation at December 31, 2010 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. For the U.K. and Canadian plans, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. Each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. The weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans decreased to 5.58 percent at December 31, 2010 from 5.88 percent at December 31, 2009.  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $130 million in 2011 compared to $133 million incurred in 2010. The 2011 estimate is based on an expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 7.35 percent, a weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 5.58 percent and various other assumptions. Pension expense beyond 2011 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.  

If the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $11 million in 2011. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, annual pension expense would increase by approximately $7 million and the December 31, 2010 pension liability would increase by about $163 million.  

The fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. On a consolidated basis, we contributed about $245 million to our pension plans in 2010 compared with $845 million in 2009. In addition, we made direct benefit payments of $24 million in 2010 compared to $25 million in 2009. We currently anticipate contributing $400 million to $500 million to our pension plans in 2011.  

The methodology for determining the discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted-average discount rates.  

Other Postretirement Benefits  

Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and/or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993, contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, and we provide no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003.  

We made benefit payments of $64 million in 2010 compared with $71 million in 2009. The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, 2011 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than $1 million and the December 31, 2010 benefit liability would increase by about $17 million.  

28

(Continued)  

The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. The annual increase in the consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 7.1 percent in 2011 and to gradually decline to 5.0 percent in 2015 and thereafter. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate.  

Retained Insurable Risks  

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and managements judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability, are based upon undiscounted loss development factors.  

Property and Depreciation  

Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset and eventual disposition (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. The determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probability-weighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes are used to estimate fair value.  

The estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and additional impairment charges may be recognized.  

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices and costs are also tested. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated.  

29  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

If a possible impairment is indicated, the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. The annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and, as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value, it has been determined that our $3.4 billion of goodwill is not impaired.  

We have no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. At December 31, 2010, we have intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of approximately $507 million and a net carrying amount of about $276 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value (based on discounted future cash flows). Judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above.  

Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)  

The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is an enterprise that has an interest in a VIE that provides the enterprise with the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, and the obligation to absorb significant losses or the right to receive significant benefits of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to be determined using a qualitative analysis considering such factors as the VIEs purpose and design, the involvement of each interest holder in the VIE, and the risks and benefits the VIE was designed to create and pass to interest holders. An enterprise is required to perform ongoing reassessments to determine if it must consolidate a VIE.  

We exercise judgment in performing the ongoing qualitative primary beneficiary assessments for our interests in the VIEs described in Item 8, Notes 2, 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments  

As of December 31, 2010, we have recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $974 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $240 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $734 million. As of December 31, 2009, the net deferred tax asset was $643 million. These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

As of December 31, 2010, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $7.3 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they

 were remitted as dividends, were lent to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non-U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination, as appropriate.  

We record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. Where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2007. IRS assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2001. We have various federal income tax return positions in administrative appeals or litigation for 1999 and 2002 to 2007. We currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

Loss Contingencies  

The outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against us is subject to uncertainty. An estimated loss contingency is accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate. Changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies.  

Legal Matters  

We have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in our opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

New Accounting Standards  

See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Business Outlook  

Pulp & Tissue Restructuring  

On January 21, 2011, we initiated a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and K-C Professional businesses. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 and will involve the streamlining, sale or closure of 5 to 6 of our manufacturing facilities around the world. In conjunction with these actions, we will be exiting certain non-strategic products, primarily non-branded offerings, and transferring some production to lower-cost facilities in order to improve overall profitability and returns. Facilities that will be impacted by the restructuring include our pulp and tissue facility in Everett, Washington and the two facilities in Australia that manufacture pulp and tissue.  

31  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

The restructuring plan will commence in the first quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2012. The restructuring is expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately $400 million to $600 million before tax ($280 million to $420 million after tax) over that period. We anticipate that the charges will fall into the following categories and approximate dollar ranges: workforce reduction costs ($50 million to $100 million); incremental depreciation ($300 million to $400 million); and other associated costs ($50 million to $100 million). Cash costs related to the streamlining of operations, sale or closure, relocation of equipment, severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 25 percent to 50 percent of the charges. Noncash charges will consist primarily of incremental depreciation.  

As a result of the restructuring, we expect that by 2013 annual net sales will be reduced by $250 million to $300 million and operating profit will increase by at least $75 million. Most of the restructuring will impact the consumer tissue business segment.  

2011 Operating Results  

We expect the economic environment to continue to be difficult in 2011. We intend to continue to focus on leveraging our strong brands, bringing innovations to market and pursuing targeted growth initiatives, while reducing costs and maximizing cash flow. We believe that the benefits of sales growth and cost savings will be partially offset by charges related to the restructuring plan described above, inflation in key cost inputs, planned increases in marketing spending, and increased interest expense. We expect to continue our program of share repurchases in 2011, and we have increased the amount of our regular quarterly dividend for 2011.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K or related documents, a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference, concerning, among other things, business outlook, including anticipated costs, scope, timing and effects of the pulp and tissue restructuring plan, raw material and energy costs, market demand and economic conditions, anticipated currency rates and exchange risk, anticipated effect of acquisitions, cost savings, changes in finished product selling prices, cash flow and uses of cash, capital spending, marketing, research and innovation spending, anticipated financial and operating results, contingencies and anticipated transactions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that our results will be as estimated.  

The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside our control, including the prices and availability of our raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for our products, energy costs, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of such estimates.  

The factors described under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K, or in our other SEC filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.
