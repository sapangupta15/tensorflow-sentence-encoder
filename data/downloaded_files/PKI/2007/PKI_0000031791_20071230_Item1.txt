PART I  

 Item 1. Business   

Overview  

We are a leading provider of technology, services and solutions to the diagnostics, detection and analysis and photonics markets. We design, manufacture, market and service components, systems and products in two reporting segments:  

       Life and Analytical Sciences. We are a leading provider of analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, software, and consumables, to the analytical sciences, genetic screening, BioDiscovery and laboratory services markets.  

       Optoelectronics. We provide a broad range of medical imaging, optical sensor and specialty lighting components used in medical, consumer products and other specialty end markets.  

The health sciences markets include all of the businesses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and our medical imaging business, as well as elements of the medical sensors and lighting businesses in our Optoelectronics segment. The photonics markets include the remaining businesses in our Optoelectronics segment.  

In fiscal 2007, we had $1,787.3 million in sales from continuing operations.  

We are a Massachusetts corporation, founded in 1947. Our headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, and we market our products and services in more than 150 countries. As of December 30, 2007, we had approximately 8,700 employees. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and we are a component of the S&P 500 Index.  

We maintain a website with the address http://www.perkinelmer.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Our Strategy  

Our strategy is focused on providing innovative products, applications, and services that drive productivity improvements in targeted high growth market segments and developing value-added applications and solutions to foster continued market development and expansion. For example, during 2007, we launched EcoAnalytix, a global initiative to provide product, training, support and service offerings targeting food safety, water quality and biofuels development applications.

Recent Developments  

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have taken the following actions in 2007:  

Acquisitions:  

Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constitutes the newborn metabolic screening (NMS) business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. The NMS business provides neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and various states. This acquisition is intended to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. This transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008.  

ViaCell, Inc. In November 2007, our wholly owned subsidiary completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell, Inc. (ViaCell), at a price of $7.25 per share. ViaCell specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. Through the tender offer, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired more than 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of ViaCell by means of a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into ViaCell, as a result of which ViaCell became our wholly owned subsidiary. The addition of ViaCells ViaCord® product offering for the preservation of umbilical cord blood, and its sales and marketing organization, is expected to facilitate the expansion of our neonatal and prenatal businesses. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately $295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As of December 30, 2007, we recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF 95-3). We had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition.  

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board of Directors (the Board) approved a plan to sell the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyteSM business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. We have determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies which focus on the market for such products. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses. We have classified the results of the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.  

Remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. In June 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. (PKI India), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting Indias life science and analytical instrumentation markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition establishes PKI India as our wholly owned subsidiary. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $1.3 million in cash plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which we paid $0.2 million during the fiscal year 2007. We expect to pay the remaining $0.5 million in quarterly installments through the first quarter of 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Improvision Ltd. In March 2007, we acquired the stock of Improvision Ltd. (Improvision), a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research. We expect   

4  

Table of Contents 

 that the addition of Improvisions imaging and analysis software to our high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions for analyzing cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $23.6 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. During 2007, we paid $0.6 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Euroscreen Products S.A. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (Euroscreen), a developer of the AequoScreen cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

Evotec Technologies GmbH. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (Evotec). The acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotecs high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, which was paid in fiscal year 2006. During 2007, we received $1.2 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.  

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed during fiscal 2007 have been reported within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.  

We took the following actions in 2007 to further focus our core businesses:  

Share Repurchase Program:  

On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.  

Restructuring:  

During fiscal 2007, we incurred $14.4 million in pre-tax restructuring and lease charges. During the first and fourth quarters of 2007, our management approved separate plans for workforce reductions in several locations and partial closure of a facility. The purpose of the restructuring plans approved in the first and fourth quarters of 2007 was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs.  

Leadership Succession Plan:  

We announced on July 26, 2007 that our Board had approved a leadership succession plan. On July 25, 2007, our Board elected Robert F. Friel to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective August 1, 2007. Mr. Friel had previously served as Vice Chairman of the Company and President of our   

5  

Table of Contents 

 Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and he remains a Director of the Company. On January 23, 2008, our Board elected Mr. Friel Chief Executive Officer and appointed Gregory L. Summe Executive Chairman of the Board, effective February 1, 2008. As Executive Chairman of the Board, Mr. Summe will continue to work for the Company at a reduced schedule until the earlier of April 21, 2009 or the date of our 2009 annual meeting of shareholders (the 2009 Meeting Date). Our Board intends that Mr. Summe will remain a Director until the 2009 Meeting Date, at which time Mr. Summe will step down as Executive Chairman and as a member of the Board.

Marketing  

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces. As of December 30, 2007, we employed approximately 2,800 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries, and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In addition, in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.  

Raw Materials and Supplies   

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain suppliers. For certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials. See further description in the applicable risk factor under Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Intellectual Property  

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide   

10  

Table of Contents 

 array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.  

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of these matters.  

Backlog  

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.  

Competition  

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.  

In our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.  

We do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our Optoelectronics segment across its full product range. However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultra specialty lighting sources, photo detectors and photodiodes, and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product reliability and quality.  

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.  

Research and Development   

Research and development expenditures were approximately $113.1 million during fiscal 2007, approximately $99.7 million during fiscal 2006, and approximately $87.4 million during fiscal 2005. The fiscal year 2007 included an in-process research and development (IPR&D) charge of $1.5 million related to the Evotec and Euroscreen acquisitions.  

11  

Table of Contents 

We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening, BioDiscovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect our research and development spending to increase on an absolute basis and in line with our growth in sales during fiscal 2008, and to continue to emphasize these same markets.  

Environmental Matters  

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.  

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.  

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.2 million as of December 30, 2007, which represents our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.  

In addition, we accrued $9.7 million during the second quarter of 2007 for a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005, representing our managements estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.  

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.  

Employees  

As of December 30, 2007, we employed approximately 8,700 employees. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers councils. As of December 30, 2007, we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,700 union and workers council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Reporting Segments  

The assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, accounting and finance, human resources, property and insurance management, information technology, treasury and other management and compliance costs, have been included as Corporate below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.  

The table below sets forth sales and operating income (loss) by reporting segment for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years:

Financial Information About Geographic Areas  

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal 2007, we had $1,127.8 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 63% of our total sales. During fiscal 2007, we derived approximately 76% of our international sales from our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and approximately 24% of our international sales from our Optoelectronics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.  

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements.
