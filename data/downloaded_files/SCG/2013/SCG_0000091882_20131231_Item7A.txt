ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

All financial instruments held by the Company described below are held for purposes other than trading.

Interest Rate Risk

The tables below provides information about long-term debt issued by the Company and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and related maturities. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices. Interest rate swap agreements are valued using discounted cash flow models with independently sourced data.

While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur.

The above tables exclude long-term debt of $3 million at December 31, 2013 and $9 million at December 31, 2012, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them.
