PART I   

  Item 1.    Business    

 General  

 We are the worlds largest enterprise software company. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software as well as applications software designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations.  

 Our goal is to offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and integrated software solutions that improve transactional efficiencies, adapt to an organizations unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information and automate business processes at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets.  

 We believe our internal, or organic, growth and continued innovation with respect to our core database, middleware and applications technologies provide the foundation for our long-term strategic plan. In fiscal 2009, we invested $2.8 billion in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products, features and services.  

 An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies.  

 On April 19, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun), a provider of enterprise computing systems, software and services, under which we have agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Sun for $9.50 per share in cash. The estimated total purchase price for Sun is approximately $7.4 billion. The transaction is subject to Sun stockholder approval, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions.  

 Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.  

 Software and Services  

 We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) On Demand and (3) education. Our software and services businesses represented 81% and 19% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2009, 80% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2008 and 79% and 21% of our  

 1   
 total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2007. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our operating segments.  

 Software Business   

 New Software Licenses  

 The new software licenses operating segment of our software business includes the licensing of database and middleware software, which consists of Oracle Databases and Oracle Fusion Middleware, as well as applications software. Our technology and business solutions are based on an internet model comprised of interconnected databases, application servers, as well as mobile devices. This architecture enables users to access business data and applications through a web browser interface, and is designed to provide customers with the most efficient and cost effective method of managing business information and applications.  

 In an internet model, database servers manage and protect a customers underlying business information, while application servers run the business applications that automate a myriad of business functions. Our architecture provides high quality business information and can be adapted to the specific needs of any industry or application. Oracle technology operates on both single server and clustered server configurations, which we refer to as grid software, and supports a choice of operating systems including Linux, Windows and UNIX. Our applications software is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructures by delivering industry solutions via an open, integrated and standards-based architecture that supports customer choice and reduces customer risk by automating business functions.  

 New software license revenues include fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products and exclude revenues derived from software license updates and product support. The standard end user software license agreement for our products provides for an initial fee to use the product in perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users or other metrics. We also have other types of software license agreements restricted by the number of employees or the license term. New software license revenues represented 31%, 34% and 33% of total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Database and Middleware Software  

 Our database and middleware software offerings provide a cost-effective, high-performance platform for running and managing business applications for mid-size businesses and large global enterprises. With an increasing focus by enterprises on reducing their total cost of IT infrastructure, our software is designed to accommodate demanding, non-stop business environments, using low cost server, storage and application grids that can incrementally scale as required. The ability to assign computing resources as required simplifies our customers IT capacity, planning and procurement to support all of their business applications. With an Oracle grid infrastructure, our customers can lower their investment in servers and storage, reduce their risk of data loss and IT infrastructure downtime and efficiently utilize available IT resources to meet business users quality of service expectations. New software license revenues from database and middleware products represented 72%, 68% and 71% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Databases  

 As the worlds most popular database, Oracle Database enables the secure storage, retrieval and manipulation of all forms of data, including business application and analytics data, and unstructured data in the form of XML files, office documents, images, video and spatial data. Designed for enterprise grid computing, the Oracle Database is available in four editions: Express Edition, Standard Edition One, Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. All editions are built using the same underlying code, which means that our database software can easily scale from small, single processor servers to clusters of multi-processor servers.  

 2   
 A number of optional offerings are available with Oracle Database Enterprise Edition to address specific customer requirements in the areas of performance and scalability, high availability, data security and compliance, data warehousing, information management and systems management. Examples of these options include:

A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Seasonality and Cyclicality  

 Our quarterly results reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and services. Our revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. General economic conditions also have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions that have negatively affected our revenues. See Selected Quarterly Financial Data in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.  

 9   
 Customers  

 Our customer base consists of a significant number of businesses of many sizes and industries, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.  

 Competition  

 The enterprise software industry is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and evolving rapidly. We compete in various segments of this industry including, but not limited to:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Key competitive factors in each of the segments that we compete include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, functionality, ease of use, compliance with open standards, product reliability, Service-Oriented Architecture, security and quality of technical support. Our customers are also demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software, which has led increasingly to our product offerings (particularly our database, middleware and applications) being viewed as a stack of software designed to work together in a standards-compliant environment.  

 Our product sales (and the relative strength of our products versus our competitors products) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things:  

       the broader platform competition between industry standard Java EE (formerly, J2EE) programming platform by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft);   

       operating system competition among, primarily, Microsofts Windows Server, Unix (including Suns Solaris, HP-UX from Hewlett Packard Company (HP) and AIX from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)) and Linux;   

       open source alternatives to commercial software, which are typically offered free of charge, subject to certain restrictions, and are readily available over the internet. Open source vendors will typically charge fees for commercial versions or unrestricted licenses of these products and for technical support of these products; and   

       Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings, which also continue to alter the competitive landscape.    

 10   
 The following lists of competitors are necessarily incomplete due to the nature of the enterprise software industry, where the competitive landscape is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change:  

 In the sale of database software, scalability, reliability, availability and security are key competitive differentiators for us. Our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, Sybase, Inc. (Sybase), NCR Corporations Teradata division, SAS Institute, Inc., Netezza Corporation, Progress Software Corporation (Progress Software) and open source databases such as Suns MySQL, Ingres and PostgreSQL, among others. Our ability to continually innovate and differentiate our database product offerings has enabled us to maintain our leading position in database software over our competitors.  

 In the sale of middleware products, our offerings include application server and application grid, business intelligence, identity and access management, portal and user interaction, Service-Oriented Architecture and business process management, and data integration. Our ability to offer a full range of rich functionality in a standards-based, open architecture has been a key competitive differentiator which has contributed to rapid growth of our middleware solutions in recent years relative to our competitors. Our middleware competitors include IBM, Microsoft, SAP AG, Sun, Progress Software, Fujitsu Software Corporation, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd., open source vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. (JBoss), Apache Geronimo, Liferay, Inc., SpringSource, Inc., MuleSource, Inc. and JasperSoft Corporation, as well as several other competitors in each element of our packaged functions such as TIBCO Software, Inc., Software AG, SOA Software, Inc., Savvion, Inc., MicroStrategy, Inc., CA, Inc. (CA), Siemens AG, Courion Corporation, EMC Corporation (RSA), Informatica Corporation, Novell, Inc. (Novell), Lombardi Software, Inc. and Pegasystems, Inc., among others.  

 Competition in the sale of applications software, in particular, is multifaceted and subject to rapid change. We currently offer several application product lines that are designed to address functions applicable to customers across many industries (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM)), as well as applications specific to operations in particular industry verticals, such as retail, financial services, communications, tax and utilities, health sciences, public sector and others. One of the main competitive differentiators in applications software is our ability to combine best-of-breed software, suite software and our application integration architecture, without adding complexity for the end user.  

 Our applications offerings (including our On Demand/Hosted and SaaS offerings) typically compete with commercial software vendors pre-packaged applications, applications offered as On Demand, SaaS, or hosted offerings, open source applications, applications developed in-house by customers, applications that were custom developed by other software vendors or systems integrators, applications consisting of a variety of discrete pieces of functionality from multiple providers that have been customized and implemented by systems integrators or consultants (such as IBM Global Services and Accenture Ltd.) and business process outsourcers (such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Fidelity Investments, Ceridian Corporation, Hewitt Associates, Inc., Accero Software (formerly Cyborg Systems Limited) and others). The variety of competing offerings is even more pronounced in industry verticals where complete industry solutions either do not exist or are addressed by combining offerings of multiple software offerings. As a result, our applications compete against offerings from the vendors listed above as well as SAP AG, IBM (through Maximo, MRO Software, Ascential Software, Cognos), Microsoft (through Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics AX, Dynamics CRM, Dynamics Snap, Dynamics SL), Lawson Software, Inc., Infor Global Solutions (with numerous independent product lines coming from acquisitions including Agilisys, Baan, infor GmbH, SSA Global Technologies, Extensity and Datastream), Ariba, Inc., IFS AB, JDA Software Group, Inc., I2 Technologies, Inc., Manhattan Associates, Inc. The Sage Group plc, salesforce.com, Inc., Taleo Corporation, SuccessFactors, Inc., as well as many other application providers and point solution providers.  

 In the sale of content management and collaboration products, we compete with Microsoft, IBM (through Domino/Notes/FileNet), EMC Corporation (Documentum), Open Text Corporation, Autonomy Corporation plc (Interwoven), HP (through Tower Software), SAP AG and Vignette Corporation, as well as open source vendors such as Alfresco Software, Inc., among others.  

 In the sale of development tools, ease of use, standards-compliance and the level of abstraction (automated code generation) are key competitive differentiators. In this area, we compete against IBM (through WebSphere Studio), Microsoft (through VisualStudio.NET), Sun (through Sun Studio), Sybase (through PowerBuilder) and others,

 including Eclipse Foundation, Inc. (Eclipse), an open source vendor. The success of our development tools is closely related to the relative popularity of our other offerings (database and middleware and applications) compared to our competitors as well as the larger platform competition between Suns Java and Microsofts .NET.  

 In the sale of enterprise management software, we compete with BMC Software, Inc., Quest Software, Inc., IBM Tivoli, HP, CA, Compuware Corporation, Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., and open source vendors such as Hyperic, Inc.  

 In the sale of operating systems, we introduced a support and service offering for Red Hats open source Linux operating system in fiscal 2007. This placed us in competition with others who offer support for the Linux operating system, including Red Hat, Novell, Inc. and Canonical Ltd. (through Ubuntu); as well as with the Unix operating systems of IBM, Sun, HP and others and the Windows Server operating systems of Microsoft.  

 In the sale of virtualization products, our offerings compete with those of VMware, Inc., IBM, Microsoft, Sun and Citrix Systems, Inc., among others, including other vendors of open source virtualization products.  

 In the sale of consulting and systems integration services, we both partner with and compete against Accenture Ltd., HP, IBM Global Services, Bearing Point, Inc., Capgemini Group, and many others (both large and small).  

 In the sale of many of our products, we also compete with products and features developed internally by customers and their IT staff.  

 Research and Development  

 We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have acquired technology through business acquisitions. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments.  

 Research and development expenditures were $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, or 12% of total revenues in each of the aforementioned fiscal years. As a percentage of new software license revenues, research and development expenditures were 39%, 36% and 37% in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete. We plan on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product offerings including our database, middleware and applications software products.  

 Employees  

 As of May 31, 2009, we employed approximately 86,000 full-time employees, including 20,000 in sales and marketing, 8,000 in software license updates and product support, 28,000 in services, 22,000 in research and development and 8,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 28,000 were located in the United States and 58,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain international subsidiaries workers councils represent our employees.
