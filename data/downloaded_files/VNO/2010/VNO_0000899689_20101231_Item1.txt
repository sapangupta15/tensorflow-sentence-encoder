Objectives and Strategy 

Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: 

· Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; 

· Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; 

· Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; 

· Investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; 

· Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and 

· Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future. 

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Substantially all businesses, including ours, were negatively affected by the 2008/2009 economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the capital and financial markets. Although there are signs of an economic recovery and greater stability in the capital and financial markets, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or any other trends on our financial results. 

ACQUISITIONS and investments 

Vornado Capital Partners, L.P. and Vornado Capital Partners Parallel, L.P. (the “Fund”) 

On July 6, 2010, we completed an initial closing of the Fund with aggregate equity commitments of $550,000,000, of which we committed $200,000,000. We expect to close on an additional $250,000,000 of equity commitments in the first quarter of 2011. We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund and it is our exclusive investment vehicle during the three-year investment period for all investments that fit within the Fund’s investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground-up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such investments; (v) noncontrolling interests in equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North America. The Fund has a term of eight years. We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements. In 2010, we incurred $6,482,000 for organization costs of the Fund, net of the Fund’s reimbursement to us, which are included in “general and administrative” expenses on our consolidated statement of income.  

The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the Fund received $146,789,000 of capital from partners, including $53,378,000 from us. During the second half of 2010, the Fund made four investments aggregating approximately $145,000,000 and reimbursed us for $1,500,000 of organization costs.

ACQUISITIONS and investments – continued  

Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (“J.C. Penney”) (NYSE: JCP) 

We own an economic interest in 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 9.9% of J.C. Penney’s outstanding common shares. Below are the details of our investment.  

We own 18,584,010 common shares at an average price of $25.70 per share, or $477,678,000 in the aggregate. These shares, which have an aggregate fair value of $600,449,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as “available for sale.” Of these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise of a call option that originated on September 28, 2010 and settled on November 9, 2010. During the period in which the call option was outstanding and classified as a derivative instrument, we recognized $112,537,000 of income from the mark-to-market of the underlying common shares, which is included in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income. During the period from November 10 through December 31, 2010, we recognized $10,234,000 from the mark-to-market of the common shares classified as available-for-sale, which is included in “accumulated other comprehensive income” (a component of shareholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet).  

We also own an economic interest in 4,815,990 common shares through a forward contract executed on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.65 per share, or $137,989,000 in the aggregate. The contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2012. The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or in part, upon one year’s notice to us. The strike price per share increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points and decreases for dividends received on the shares. The contract is a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying common shares are recognized in “interest and other investment income (loss), net” on our consolidated statement of income. During the period from October 7, 2010 through December 31, 2010, we recognized $17,616,000 of income from the mark-to-market of this position, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share at December 31, 2010. 

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate economic net gain on our investment in J.C. Penney was $140,387,000, based on J.C. Penney’s closing share price of $32.31 per share and our weighted average cost of $26.31 per share. 

Investment in LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”) 

On July 29, 2010, as a part of LNR’s recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000 mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNR’s parent, Riley Holdco Corp. The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of $417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNR’s total debt to $425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below. We account for our equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one-quarter lag basis.  

LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (“CDO”) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary. The assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which are non-recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us. Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNR’s consolidated income statement.  

510 Fifth Avenue 

On October 8, 2010, we acquired 510 Fifth Avenue, a 59,000 square foot retail property located at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York, for $57,000,000, comprised of $24,700,000 in cash and $32,300,000 of existing debt.  

San Jose, California 

On October 15, 2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000 square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000, consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt.  

Atlantic City, New Jersey 

On November 4, 2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash. The land is leased to the partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December 2070. In January 2011, we completed a 10-year $60,000,000 financing of this land. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.14% and amortizes beginning in the third year, based on a 30-year schedule.

Dispositions 

On October 20, 2010, we sold a 45% ownership interest in 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (the Warner Building) and 1101 17th Street, for $236,700,000, comprised of $91,000,000 in cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt. We retained the remaining 55% ownership interest and continue to manage and lease the properties. Based on the Warner Building’s implied fair value of $445,000,000, we recognized a net gain of $54,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The gain on 1101 17th Street, based on an implied fair value of $81,000,000, will be recognized when we monetize our investment. 

On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and contracted to sell 1227 25th Street, subject to customary closing conditions, for an aggregate price of $127,000,000. We will retain net proceeds of approximately $107,000,000, after repaying an existing mortgage and recognize a net gain of approximately $44,000,000 in the first quarter of 2011. 

In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the High Point Complex in North Carolina as a result of insufficient cash flow and the loan went into default. In November 2010, the property was placed in receivership. While the receivership process is inherently lengthy, we anticipate that the property will be sold in the first half of 2011, at which time the assets and liabilities will be removed from our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize a net gain of approximately $80,000,000. 

Financing Activities 

On February 11, 2011, we completed a $425,000,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office building. The seven-year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%. The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year. We retained net proceeds of approximately $139,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.  

On February 10, 2011, we completed a $150,000,000 financing of 2121 Crystal Drive, a 506,000 square foot office building located in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. The 12-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.51% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in third year. This property was previously unencumbered. 

On January 10, 2011, we completed a $75,000,000 financing of North Bergen (Tonnelle Avenue), a 410,000 square foot strip shopping center. The seven-year fixed rate loan bears interest rate at 4.59%, provides for interest only payments during the first five years of the term and amortizes based on a 25-year schedule. This property was previously unencumbered. 

In December 2010, we acquired the mortgage loan secured by the Springfield Mall, located in Fairfax County, Virginia for $115,000,000 in cash. The loan had an outstanding balance of $171,500,000. In a separate transaction, we acquired our partner’s interest in the partnership that owns the mall in exchange for $25,000,000 in Operating Partnership units. These transactions resulted in a $102,932,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt. 

In August 2010, we sold $660,000,000 of 10-year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization. The notes are comprised of a $600,000,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000,000 variable rate component and are cross-collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers. The $600,000,000 fixed rate portion bears interest at an initial rate of 4.18% and a weighted average rate of 4.31% over the 10-year term and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule. The variable rate portion bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.36%, with a 1% floor (2.36% at December 31, 2010). 

In March 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015 and retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000,000. The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%. The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015.  

In 2010, through open market repurchases and tender offers, we purchased $270,491,000 aggregate face amount ($264,476,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $17,000,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $274,857,000 and $17,382,000 in cash, respectively, resulting in a net loss of $10,381,000 and $401,000, respectively.

Development and Redevelopment Projects 

We expended $156,775,000 in 2010 to complete development projects.  

On October 1, 2010, Arlington County adopted a new Sector Plan for Crystal City that provides for additional density and increased building heights which would permit us to grow our assets in Crystal City from 8.0 million square feet currently to as much as 11.5 million square feet.  

During 2010, we entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the “County”) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the “Facility”), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Cleveland’s central business district. The County will fund the development of the Facility, using proceeds from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective control of the property. During the 17-year development and operating period, we will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which is net of our $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County. Our obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by us only to the extent that we first receive at least an equal payment from the County. We engaged a contractor to construct the Facility pursuant to a guaranteed maximum price contract. Although we are ultimately responsible for cost overruns, the contractor is responsible for all costs incurred in excess of its contract and has provided a completion guaranty. Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013. Subsequent thereto, we are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for tenant improvements, are responsible for all operating expenses and are entitled to the net operating income, if any, of the Facility. The County may terminate the operating agreement five years from the completion of development and periodically thereafter, if we fail to achieve certain performance thresholds. We plan to account for these agreements using criteria set forth in ASC 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements, as we are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management related services over the 17-year term. We plan to recognize development fees using the percentage of completion method of accounting.  

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities for which final plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined. These projects include the Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia and the Hotel Pennsylvania and 220 Central Park South in Manhattan. 

There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget. 

Segment Data 

We operate in the following business segments: New York Office Properties, Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties, Merchandise Mart Properties and Toys “R” Us. Financial information related to these business segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is set forth in Note 22 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has trade show operations in Canada and Switzerland. The Toys segment has 732 locations internationally.  

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys’ fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one-quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The New York and Washington, DC Office Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart Properties segment has also experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail Properties segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.  

8 

tenants ACCOUNTING FOR over 10% of revenues 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. 

Certain Activities 

We are not required to base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold as circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. While we may seek the vote of our shareholders in connection with any particular material transaction, generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by our Board of Trustees without the vote of shareholders. 

Employees  

As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately 4,780 employees, of which 317 are corporate staff. The New York Office Properties segment has 126 employees and an additional 2,680 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York Office and Washington, DC Office properties. The Washington, DC Office Properties, Retail Properties and Merchandise Mart Properties segments have 400, 176 and 576 employees, respectively, and the Hotel Pennsylvania has 505 employees. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities, including Toys or Alexander’s, of which we own 32.7% and 32.4%, respectively.
