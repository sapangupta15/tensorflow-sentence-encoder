 Segment Reporting Change  

 In prior periods, the Companys operations were aggregated and organized into the following four segments: Engineered Products  North America; Engineered Products  International; Specialty Systems  North America; and Specialty Systems  International. The segment information in prior years has been restated to conform to the new segment presentation.  

 80/20 Business Process  

 A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 825 operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:  

       Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.   

       Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.   

       Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.   

       Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.    

 The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has consistently improved its operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those business units that have operating results below expectations to help those units better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 In 2007 and 2006, the Company completed the divestitures of certain construction, consumer packaging and automotive machinery businesses and recognized after-tax gains on disposal of $40.2 million in 2007, including a tax benefit of $7.0 million, and $14.3 million in 2006, net of tax expense of $4.8 million. In addition, a consumer packaging and an automotive components business have been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2007.  

 In 2004 and 2003, the Company sold the former Consumer Products segment, which was comprised of the following businesses: Precor specialty exercise equipment, West Bend small appliances and premium cookware, and Florida Tile ceramic tile. The Companys net loss on disposal of the segment was $0.9 million in 2004 and $16.5 million in 2003.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2008 were not material as of December 31, 2007.  

 The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:  

 Competition  

 The Companys global competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products the Company manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the product or market, the Company may compete with a limited number of companies or with many others. The Company is a leading producer of plastic  

 5   

 and metal components and fasteners; industrial packaging machinery and related consumables; welding products and related consumables; automotive aftermarket maintenance and appearance products; food service equipment; laminate products; polymers and fluid products; consumer packaging; materials testing equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.  

 Raw Materials  

 The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily metals, plastics, paper and chemicals, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are anticipated.  

 Research and Development  

 The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and development costs are set forth on page 54 of the Companys 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders.  

 The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,700 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.  

 The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys patents would not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  

 Trademarks  

 Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Alpine, Angleboard, Apex, Ark-Les, Bernard, Betaprint, Binks, Buehler, Buildex, Chemtronics, Click Commerce, Covid, Deltar, Densit, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Electrocal, Evercoat, E-Z Anchor, Fastex, Filtertek, Foilmark, Forte, Foster, Franklynn, Futura Coatings, Gema, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Instron, Intellibuild, Keps, Kester, Krafft, Lachenmeier, Lebo, LPS, Magna, Magnaflux, Meyercord, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Nexus, NorDen, Orbitalum, Orgapack, Paktron, Paslode, Permatex, Plexus, Polymark, Pro/Mark, Pryda, QMI, Racor, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Resopal, Reyflex, Rippey, Rockwell, Rocol, Shakeproof, Shore, Signode, Simco, Space Bag, Spectrum, Speedline, Spiroid, SPIT, Stero, Strapex, Tapcon, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Tregaskiss, Truswal Systems, Valeron, Versachem, Vulcan, WERCS, Wilsonart, Wynns and Zip-Pak.  

 Environmental  

 The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.  

 Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys  

 6   

 revenues or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products.  

 Employees  

 The Company employed approximately 60,000 persons as of December 31, 2007 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.  

 International  

 The Companys international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 51 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as construction, general industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and service, food and beverage, consumer durables, electronics, primary metals and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys international operations contributed approximately 49% of revenues in 2007, 43% of revenues in 2006 and 42% of revenues in 2005.  

 Refer to pages 30 through 47 and page 72 in the Companys 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.
