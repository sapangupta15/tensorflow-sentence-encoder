Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

 Corporate Profile and Significant Developments  

 M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $68.0 billion at December 31, 2010. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.).  

 M&T Bank, with total assets of $67.1 billion at December 31, 2010, is a New York-chartered commercial bank with 738 domestic banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, a full-service commercial banking office in Ontario, Canada, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in their markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although loans are originated through lending offices in other states and in Ontario, Canada. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multifamily commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency.  

 M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $797 million at December 31, 2010, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone, Internet and direct mail marketing techniques.  

 On November 5, 2010, M&T Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to assume all of the deposits, except certain brokered deposits, and acquire certain assets of K Bank, based in Randallstown, Maryland. As part of the transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share arrangement with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be    

 32   
 reimbursed by the FDIC for most losses it incurs on the acquired loan portfolio. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired in the transaction totaled approximately $556 million, including $154 million of loans and $186 million in cash, and liabilities assumed aggregated $528 million, including $491 million of deposits. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), M&T Bank recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $17 million ($28 million before taxes).  

 On November 1, 2010, M&T entered into a definitive agreement with Wilmington Trust Corporation (Wilmington Trust), headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, under which Wilmington Trust will be acquired by M&T. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Wilmington Trust common shareholders will receive .051372 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Wilmington Trust common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $351 million (with the price based on M&Ts closing price of $74.75 per share as of October 29, 2010), plus the assumption of $330 million in preferred stock issued by Wilmington Trust as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program  Capital Purchase Program of the U.S. Department of Treasury (U.S. Treasury).  

 At December 31, 2010, Wilmington Trust had approximately $10.9 billion of assets, including $7.5 billion of loans, $10.1 billion of liabilities, including $9.0 billion of deposits, and $60.1 billion of combined assets under management, including $43.6 billion managed by Wilmington Trust and $16.5 billion managed by affiliates. The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of various state and Federal regulators and Wilmington Trusts common shareholders, and is expected to be completed by mid-year 2011.  

 Net acquisition and integration-related gains and expenses (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated with the K Bank acquisition transaction and with the pending Wilmington Trust acquisition incurred during 2010 totaled to a net gain of $27 million ($16 million after tax-effect, or $.14 of diluted earnings per common share). Reflected in that amount are the $28 million gain ($17 million after tax-effect, or $.14 of diluted earnings per common share) on the K Bank transaction and $771 thousand ($469 thousand after tax-effect) of expenses associated with the K Bank and Wilmington Trust transactions. The gain reflects the amount of financial support and indemnification against loan losses that M&T Bank obtained from the FDIC.  

 The condition of the domestic and global economy over the last three years has significantly impacted the financial services industry as a whole, and specifically, the financial results of the Company. In particular, rising unemployment and significantly depressed residential real estate valuations have led to elevated levels of loan charge-offs experienced by financial institutions throughout that time period, resulting in reduced capital levels. Although most economists believe that the recession in the United States ended sometime in the latter half of 2009, the recovery of the economy since then has been very slow. While the Company experienced lower levels of loan charge-offs during 2010 as compared with 2009, such charge-offs continued to be at higher than historical levels. In addition, many financial institutions have continued to experience unrealized losses related to investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate due to a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Many financial institutions, including the Company, have taken charges for those unrealized losses that were deemed to be other than temporary.  

 Allied Irish Banks (AIB) received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock on April 1, 2003 as a result of M&Ts acquisition of a subsidiary of AIB on that date. Those shares of common stock owned by AIB represented 22.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of M&T common stock on September 30, 2010. In an effort to raise its capital position to meet new Irish government-mandated capital requirements, AIB completed the sale of the 26,700,000 shares on November 4, 2010. As a result, the provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between M&T and AIB related to AIBs rights as a substantial shareholder in the corporate governance of M&T became inoperative as of that date.  

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended GAAP in June 2009 relating to: (1) the consolidation of variable interest entities to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and (2) accounting for transfers of financial assets to eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special-purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage    

 33   
 securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred assets. The amended guidance became effective as of January 1, 2010. The recognition and measurement provisions of the amended guidance were applied to transfers that occurred on or after the effective date. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2010, the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special-purpose entities must now be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with applicable consolidation guidance, including the new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities.  

 In accordance with the new accounting requirements, effective January 1, 2010 the Company included in its consolidated financial statements one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that were included in non-recourse securitization transactions using qualified special-purpose trusts. The effect of that consolidation as of January 1, 2010 was to increase residential real estate loans by $424 million, decrease the amortized cost of available-for-sale investment securities by $360 million (fair value of $355 million as of January 1, 2010), and increase borrowings by $65 million. Information concerning those loans is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 On August 28, 2009, M&T Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank (Bradford), based in Baltimore, Maryland. As part of the transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share arrangement with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for most losses it incurs on the acquired loan portfolio. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired in the transaction totaled approximately $469 million, including $302 million of loans, and liabilities assumed aggregated $440 million, including $361 million of deposits. In accordance with GAAP, M&T Bank recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $18 million ($29 million before taxes).  

 On May 23, 2009, M&T acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Provident Bankshares Corporation (Provident), a bank holding company based in Baltimore, Maryland, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident Bank, Providents banking subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. The results of operations acquired in the Provident transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since May 23, 2009. Provident common shareholders received .171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Provident common stock, resulting in M&T issuing a total of 5,838,308 common shares with an acquisition date fair value of $273 million. In addition, based on the merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to purchase Provident common stock were converted into options to purchase the common stock of M&T. Those options had an estimated fair value of approximately $1 million. In total, the purchase price was approximately $274 million based on the fair value on the acquisition date of M&T common stock exchanged and the options to purchase M&T common stock. Holders of Providents preferred stock were issued shares of new Series B and Series C Preferred Stock of M&T having substantially identical terms. That preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock associated with the Series C Preferred Stock added $162 million to M&Ts shareholders equity. The Series B Preferred Stock has a preference value of $27 million, pays non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 10%, and is convertible into 433,148 shares of M&T common stock. The Series C Preferred Stock has a preference value of $152 million, pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% through November 2013 and 9% thereafter, and is held by the U.S. Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program  Capital Purchase Program.  

 The Provident transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired totaled $6.3 billion, including $4.0 billion of loans and leases (including approximately $1.7 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.4 billion of consumer loans, $700 million of commercial loans and leases and $300 million of residential real estate loans) and $1.0 billion of investment securities. Liabilities assumed were $5.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of deposits. The transaction added $436 million to M&Ts shareholders equity, including $280 million of common equity and $156 million of preferred equity. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $332 million of goodwill and $63 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an accelerated method. The acquisition of Provident expanded    

 34   
 the Companys presence in the Mid-Atlantic area, gave the Company the second largest deposit share in Maryland, and tripled the Companys presence in Virginia.  

 Application of the acquisition method requires that acquired loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits the carry-over of the acquired entitys allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans required estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the loans. The impact of estimated credit losses on all acquired loans was considered in the estimation of future cash flows used in the determination of estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.  

 Net merger-related expenses associated with the Bradford and Provident acquisition transactions incurred during 2009 totaled $60 million ($36 million after tax effect, or $.31 of diluted earnings per common share). Reflected in that amount are the $29 million ($18 million after tax effect, or $.15 of diluted earnings per common share) gain on the Bradford transaction and $89 million ($54 million after tax effect, or $.46 of diluted earnings per common share) of expenses associated with the Provident and Bradford transactions. The gain reflects the amount of financial support and indemnification against loan losses that M&T Bank obtained from the FDIC. The expenses were for professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; costs related to branch and office consolidations; costs related to termination of existing Provident contractual arrangements for various services; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to customers of Bradford and Provident; severance for former employees of Provident; incentive compensation costs; travel costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices.  

 In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC initiated measures to stabilize the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was signed into law on October 3, 2008 and authorized the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be used to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Under the authority of EESA, the U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase program under TARP to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury purchased senior preferred shares of financial institutions which pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for five years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The terms of the senior preferred shares, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provide that the shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends upon approval of the U.S. Treasury and the participating financial institutions primary banking regulator. The senior preferred shares are non-voting and qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting purposes. In connection with purchasing senior preferred shares, the U.S. Treasury also received warrants to purchase the common stock of participating financial institutions having a market price of 15% of the amount of senior preferred shares on the date of investment with an exercise price equal to the market price of the participating institutions common stock at the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The warrants have a term of ten years and are immediately exercisable, in whole or in part. For a period of three years, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for participating institutions to increase their common stock dividend or repurchase their common stock, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice. Participation in the capital purchase program also includes certain restrictions on executive compensation that were modified by ARRA and further defined by the U.S. Treasury in its Interim Final Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance. The minimum subscription amount available to a participating institution was one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The maximum suggested subscription amount was three percent of risk-weighted assets. On December 23, 2008, M&T issued to the U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares of M&T common stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected to participate in the capital purchase program at an amount equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the time. As already noted, Provident also participated in the capital purchase program. Preferred stock resulting from that participation was converted into $152 million of M&T Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 407,542 shares of M&T common stock at $55.76 per share. In total, M&T has $752 million of preferred stock outstanding related to the capital purchase program.

 Additional information regarding preferred stock of M&T is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Recent Legislative Developments  

 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. This new law has and will continue to significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, and will fundamentally change the system of regulatory oversight of the Company, including through the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and, as a result, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is not yet known. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on M&Ts business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

 The Dodd-Frank Act broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2013.  

 The legislation also requires that publicly traded companies give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments, and authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a companys proxy materials. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded.  

 The Dodd-Frank Act established a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.  

 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 36   
      more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; and    

       Creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will recommend to the Federal Reserve Board increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.    

 The environment in which banking organizations will operate after the financial crisis, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations, may have long-term effects on the business model and profitability of banking organizations, the full extent of which cannot now be foreseen. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on M&T, its customers or the financial industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate. Provisions in the legislation that revoke the Tier 1 capital treatment of trust preferred securities and otherwise require revisions to the capital requirements of M&T and M&T Bank could require M&T and M&T Bank to seek other sources of capital in the future. The impact of new rules relating to overdraft fee practices is included herein under the heading Other Income.  

 Critical Accounting Estimates  

 The Companys significant accounting policies conform with GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:  

       Allowance for credit losses  The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses.   

       Valuation methodologies  Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, privately issued mortgage-backed securities, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, and other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations; capitalized servicing assets; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; value ascribed to stock-based compensation; estimated residual values of property associated with leases; and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various      

 37   
      assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include investment securities, other investments, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.    

       Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements  Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding the Companys income taxes is presented in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods and the degree to which the Company can influence those outcomes. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.    

 Overview  

 The Company recorded net income during 2010 of $736 million or $5.69 of diluted earnings per common share, up 94% and 97%, respectively, from $380 million or $2.89 of diluted earnings per common share in 2009. Basic earnings per common share rose 97% to $5.72 in 2010 from $2.90 in 2009. Net income in 2008 aggregated $556 million, while diluted and basic earnings per common share were $5.01 and $5.04, respectively. The after-tax impact of net merger-related gains and expenses associated with the acquisition transactions previously described totaled to a net gain of $16 million ($27 million pre-tax) or $.14 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2010, and net expenses of $36 million ($60 million pre-tax) or $.31 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2009. Similar expenses of $2 million ($4 million pre-tax) or $.02 of basic and diluted earnings per common share were incurred in 2008 related to acquisition transactions completed in 2007. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2010 was 1.08%, compared with .56% in 2009 and .85% in 2008. The return on average common shareholders equity was 9.30% in 2010, 5.07% in 2009 and 8.64% in 2008.  

 The Companys improved financial performance in 2010 as compared with 2009 was largely driven by higher net interest income and lower credit costs. The higher net interest income was the result of a 35 basis point (hundredths of one percent) widening of the net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. That widening reflects a 38 basis point reduction of rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including a 40 basis point reduction in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Reflecting the wider net interest margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $214 million, or 10%, to $2.29 billion in 2010 from $2.08 billion in 2009.  

 While the provision for credit losses during 2010 was elevated when compared to historical levels, it declined 39% to $368 million from $604 million in 2009. Net charge-offs dropped 33% to $346 million in 2010 from $514 million in 2009. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .67% in 2010 and 1.01% in 2009. The lower level of net charge-offs in 2010 was led by a decrease in    

 38   
 commercial loan charge-offs, which declined to $65 million from $172 million in 2009. Another significant factor in the higher net income in 2010 was a decrease in other-than-temporary impairment charges on investment securities to $86 million ($53 million after tax-effect) from $138 million ($84 million after tax-effect) in 2009. Those impairment charges were largely related to certain privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) backed by residential real estate loans and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by trust preferred securities issued by other financial institutions.  

 Several noteworthy items were reflected in the Companys financial results in 2009. The provision for credit losses and net loan charge-offs during 2009 were at higher than historical levels, due largely to the recessionary state of the U.S. economy and its impact on consumers and businesses, and the continuation of a distressed residential real estate market. The provision for credit losses in 2009 was $604 million, up from $412 million in 2008. Net charge-offs during 2009 aggregated $514 million, compared with $383 million in 2008. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were 1.01% and .78% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Charge-offs in all major loan categories rose from 2008 to 2009. The most dramatic increase in net charge-offs was related to commercial loans, which rose to $172 million in 2009 from $94 million in 2008. That increase was largely driven by a small number of significant commercial loan charge-offs. In addition, net charge-offs of residential real estate loans rose to $92 million in 2009 from $63 million in 2008, reflecting turbulence in the residential real estate market place that resulted in deteriorating real estate values and increased delinquencies. The Company also incurred elevated costs in 2009 related to the workout process for modifying residential mortgage loans of creditworthy borrowers and to the foreclosure process for borrowers unable to make payments on their loans.  

 During 2009, $84 million of after-tax other-than-temporary impairment charges ($138 million before taxes) were recorded on certain available-for-sale investment securities, reducing basic and diluted earnings per common share by $.73. The Company also experienced substantially higher costs related to deposit assessments by the FDIC. Such costs rose to $97 million in 2009 from $7 million in 2008 and reflected higher assessment rates, expirations of available credits and a $33 million second quarter 2009 special assessment levied by the FDIC on insured financial institutions to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund. That special assessment reduced net income and diluted earnings per common share by $20 million and $.17, respectively.  

 The Companys financial results for 2008 were also affected by several notable factors. Largely the result of the state of the U.S. economy and the distressed residential real estate marketplace, the Companys provision for credit losses in 2008 was $412 million, significantly higher than $192 million in 2007. Net charge-offs of loans in 2008 rose to $383 million from $114 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .78% and .26% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. While charge-offs were up in all major categories of loans, the most significant contributors to the sharp rise were loan charge-offs related to residential real estate markets; charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate jumped from $4 million in 2007 to $100 million in 2008, and residential real estate loan charge-offs grew to $63 million in 2008 from $19 million in 2007. Not only did the condition of the residential real estate markets negatively impact the Companys financial results in 2008 through a higher provision for credit losses, but significantly higher costs were incurred related to the workout process for modifying residential mortgage loans and to the foreclosure process.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, a $153 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment charge was recorded related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). The write-down was taken on preferred stock with a basis of $162 million following the U.S. Governments placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7, 2008. The Company recognized additional other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2008 totaling $29 million (pre-tax) related to certain CDOs and CMOs. In total, other-than-temporary impairment charges on investment securities aggregated $182 million ($111 million after tax effect) during 2008, thereby lowering diluted earnings per common share by $1.00.  

 Also reflected in the Companys 2008 results was $29 million of after-tax income, or $.26 of diluted earnings per common share, resulting from M&T Banks status as a member bank of Visa. During the last quarter of 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering    

 39   
 (IPO) in 2008. As part of that reorganization M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of Class B common stock of Visa. M&T Bank was allocated 1,967,028 Class B common shares of Visa based on its proportionate ownership of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were mandatorily redeemed in March 2008 for an after-tax gain of $20 million ($33 million pre-tax), which was recorded as gain on bank investment securities in the consolidated statement of income, adding $.18 to diluted earnings per common share. In accordance with GAAP, the Company has not recognized any value for its remaining common stock ownership interest in Visa. During the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO of common stock and, as part of the transaction, funded an escrow account with $3 billion from the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential settlements arising out of certain litigation against Visa. As a result, during the first three months of 2008, the Company reversed approximately $15 million of a liability accrued during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to such litigation, adding $9 million to net income ($.08 per diluted common share). That liability had been accrued in 2007 because M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa are obligated under various agreements to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against Visa. Visa subsequently announced that it had further funded the escrow account to provide for the settlement of the litigation. Those subsequent fundings did not result in a material impact to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations as of or for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.  

 The Company resolved certain tax issues during the third quarter of 2008 related to its activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007. As a result, the Company paid $40 million to settle those issues, but was able to reduce previously accrued income tax expense in 2008 by $40 million, thereby adding $.36 to that years diluted earnings per common share.  

 As previously noted, net interest income recorded on a taxable-equivalent basis rose 10% to $2.29 billion in 2010 from $2.08 billion in 2009, reflecting a wider net interest margin. Average earning assets during 2010 were $59.7 billion, little changed from $59.6 billion in 2009.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income in 2009 was 6% higher than $1.96 billion in 2008. Contributing to the improvement were growth in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets rose 3% to $59.6 billion in 2009 from $58.0 billion in 2008, largely due to the $5.5 billion of earning assets obtained in the Provident and Bradford transactions. The net interest margin widened 11 basis points to 3.49% in 2009 from 3.38% in 2008, largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  

 As previously noted, the provision for credit losses of $368 million in 2010 was down 39% from $604 million in 2009. Net charge-offs totaled $346 million in 2010, down from $514 million in 2009. The provision for credit losses and net charge-offs in 2009 were up significantly from $412 million and $383 million, respectively, in 2008. Deteriorating economic conditions impacting the quality of outstanding loans to businesses and consumers, and depressed residential real estate valuations and their impact on the Companys portfolios of residential mortgage loans and loans to residential real estate builders and developers, were the most significant factors contributing to the higher levels of the provision and net charge-offs in 2009 as compared with the preceding year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding were .78% in 2008. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.  

 Noninterest income rose 6% to $1.11 billion in 2010 from $1.05 billion in 2009. Gains and losses on bank investment securities (consisting predominantly of other-than-temporary impairment charges) totaled to net losses of $84 million in 2010 and $137 million in 2009. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment securities, the $28 million gain recorded on the K Bank transaction in 2010 and the $29 million gain recorded on the Bradford transaction in 2009, noninterest income was $1.16 billion in each of 2010 and 2009. Declines in revenues related to residential mortgage banking, brokerage services and the Companys trust business were offset by higher service charges on deposit accounts, credit-related fees and other revenues from operations.  

 Noninterest income in 2009 was up 12% from $939 million in 2008. Gains and losses on bank investment securities (including other-than-temporary impairment losses) totaled to net losses of    

 40   
 $148 million in 2008. Those losses in 2008 were due to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of the Companys privately issued CMOs, CDOs and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The investment securities losses in 2008 are net of the $33 million gain from the sale of shares of Visa. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment securities and the $29 million gain recorded on the Bradford transaction, noninterest income of $1.16 billion in 2009 was 6% higher than $1.09 billion in 2008. Contributing to that improvement were higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on acquisition-related deposit accounts, partially offset by declines in trust and brokerage services income.  

 Noninterest expense in 2010 totaled $1.91 billion, down 3% from $1.98 billion in 2009. During 2008, noninterest expense aggregated $1.73 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $58 million, $64 million and $67 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $771,000 in 2010, $89 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2008. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.86 billion in 2010, $1.83 billion in 2009 and $1.66 billion in 2008. The increase in such expenses from 2009 to 2010 was largely attributable to higher costs for professional services and advertising in 2010, and a $22 million reduction of the allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there was no change to that impairment allowance. Partially offsetting those factors were declines in expenses in 2010 related to foreclosed properties and FDIC assessments. The most significant factors for the higher level of noninterest operating expenses in 2009 as compared with 2008 were the higher FDIC assessments, costs associated with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford, and higher foreclosure-related expenses. Partially offsetting those increases was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $22 million in 2009, compared with an addition to the valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008. Included in operating expenses in 2010 were $15 million of tax-deductible contributions made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. Similar contributions of $12 million and $6 million were made in 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses (as previously defined) divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities and gains on merger transactions), was 53.7% in 2010, compared with 56.5% in 2009 and 54.4% in 2008.

 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations  

 As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.7 billion at each of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $3.5 billion at each of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2008. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $35 million, $39 million and $41 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and gains and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.  

 Net operating income aggregated $755 million in 2010, up 66% from $455 million in 2009. Diluted net operating earnings per common share in 2010 rose 65% to $5.84 from $3.54 in 2009. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were $599 million and $5.39, respectively, during 2008.  

 Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.17% in 2010, compared with .71% in 2009 and .97% in 2008. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 18.95% in 2010, compared with 13.42% and 19.63% in 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in table 2.

 Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities  

 Reflecting a 35 basis point widening of the net interest margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 10% to $2.29 billion in 2010 from $2.08 billion in 2009. The Companys net interest margin increased to 3.84% in 2010 from 3.49% in 2009, predominantly the result of lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings. Average earning assets were $59.7 billion in 2010, compared with $59.6 billion in 2009. As compared with 2009, a slight increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases was offset by a decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities.  

 Average loans and leases were $51.3 billion in 2010, up 1% from $51.0 billion in 2009. The full-year impact of the loans obtained in the Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions was offset by sluggish borrower demand for commercial loans. Average commercial loans and leases declined 6% to $13.1 billion in 2010 from $13.9 billion in 2009. Commercial real estate loans averaged $20.7 billion in 2010, up 3% from $20.1 billion in 2009. Average residential real estate loans increased 8% to $5.7 billion in 2010 from $5.3 billion in 2009, largely due to the impact of adopting the previously noted new accounting rules on January 1, 2010. The Companys consumer loan portfolio averaged $11.7 billion in each of 2010 and 2009.  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis aggregated $2.08 billion in 2009, up 6% from $1.96 billion in 2008, the result of growth in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $59.6 billion in 2009, up 3% from $58.0 billion in 2008. Growth in average loan and lease balances outstanding, which rose 4% to $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008, was partially offset by a decline in average investment securities, which decreased 6% to $8.4 billion in 2009 from $9.0 billion in 2008. The growth in average loans in 2009 was predominantly the result of loans obtained in the Provident and Bradford transactions of $4.0 billion on May 23, 2009 and $302 million on August 28, 2009, respectively. In total, the acquired loans consisted of approximately $700 million of commercial loans, $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, $400 million of residential real estate loans and $1.4 billion of consumer loans. Including the impact of acquired loan balances, commercial loans and leases averaged $13.9 billion in 2009, up slightly from $13.8 billion in 2008; average commercial real estate loans increased 9% to $20.1 billion in 2009 from $18.4 billion in 2008; average residential real estate loans declined 3% to $5.3 billion in 2009 from $5.5 billion in 2008; and consumer loans averaged $11.7 billion in 2009, 5% higher than $11.2 billion in 2008. The improvement in the net interest margin, which widened 11 basis points to 3.49% in 2009 from 3.38% in 2008, was largely the result of lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.

 Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, aggregated $13.4 billion at December 31, 2010, representing 26% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents information on commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2010 relating to geographic area, size, borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $13.4 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2010, approximately $11.4 billion, or 85%, were secured, while 46%, 24% and 18% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia), respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2010 aggregated $1.4 billion, of which 44% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 16% were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area and another 10% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.

 International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $105 million and $55 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in such loans was due to $61 million of loans at M&T Banks commercial branch in Ontario, Canada, which opened in the second quarter of 2010. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services and coverage of 90% on loans to U.S. exporters of goods and services to foreign buyers. The loans generally range up to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under those programs at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $32 million and $43 million, respectively.  

 Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 65% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2010, compared with 62% in 2009 and 60% in 2008. At December 31, 2010, the Company held approximately $21.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, $5.9 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties (including $341 million of loans held for sale) and $6.6 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $20.9 billion, $5.5 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Loans obtained in the 2009 Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions included $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, $400 million of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties and $1.1 billion of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit. Included in total loans and leases were amounts due from builders and developers of residential real estate aggregating $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which $1.35 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, were classified as commercial real estate loans.  

 Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately seven to ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction and development loans made to investors, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 51% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2010. New York City metropolitan area commercial real estate loans totaled $7.3 billion at the 2010 year-end. The $6.1 billion of investor-owned commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties, retail space, and office space. The Companys experience has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less, while loans of more than $50 million made up approximately 14% of the total.

 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED DISCOUNT

  (a)    Includes approximately $450 million of construction loans.   

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied). Approximately 80% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for    

 49   
 loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 77% and 68%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less.  

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 8% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2010.  

 Commercial real estate construction and development loans made to investors presented in table 6 totaled $3.8 billion at December 31, 2010, or 7% of total loans and leases. Approximately 96% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2010 were $1.35 billion of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Information about the credit performance of the Companys loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties is included herein under the heading Provision For Credit Losses. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multifamily residential housing, retail space and other commercial development.  

 M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a commercial real estate lending subsidiary of M&T Bank, participates in the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009 aggregated $204 million and $123 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $8.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  

 Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $5.9 billion at December 31, 2010, including approximately 39% secured by properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 21% secured by properties located in the Mid-Atlantic area. At December 31, 2010, $341 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $530 million at December 31, 2009. The Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment at December 31, 2010 totaled $648 million, compared with $789 million at December 31, 2009. Loans to individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties totaled $71 million at December 31, 2010, or approximately .1% of total loans and leases, compared with $76 million or .1% at December 31, 2009. Information about the credit performance of the Companys Alt-A mortgage loans and other residential mortgage loans is included herein under the heading Provision For Credit Losses.  

 Consumer loans comprised approximately 23% of the average loan portfolio during each of 2010 and 2009. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 11% of average loans outstanding in each of 2010 and 2009. Automobile loans represented approximately 5% and 6% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2010 and 2009, respectively. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2010. Approximately 44% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010 were secured by properties in New York State, and 19% and 35% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were approximately $5.8 billion and $5.4 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, 35% and 26% of the automobile loan portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval    

 50   
 procedures. Outstanding automobile loan balances declined to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010 from $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009.  

 Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2010, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states. Approximately 47% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2010 were to New York State customers, while 18% and 23% were to Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area customers, respectively.

  (a)    Includes loans secured by properties located in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City.   

 Balances of investment securities averaged $8.0 billion in 2010, compared with $8.4 billion and $9.0 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in such balances from 2009 to 2010 largely reflects maturities and paydowns of mortgage-backed securities, maturities of federal agency notes and the impact of adopting the new accounting rules on January 1, 2010 as already noted, partially offset by purchases of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the first half of 2010, aggregating approximately $1.3 billion. The decline in average investment securities balances during 2009 as compared with 2008 largely reflects paydowns of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the investment securities obtained in the Provident transaction and the impact of a first quarter 2009 residential real estate loan securitization. The Company securitized approximately $141 million of residential real estate loans in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie Mae. During June and July 2008, the Company securitized approximately $875 million of residential real estate loans in guaranteed mortgage securitizations with Fannie Mae. The Company recognized no gain or loss on the 2009 and 2008 securitizations because it retained all of the resulting securities.   

 51   
 The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, debt securities issued by municipalities, capital preferred securities issued by certain financial institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing the investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a $142 million AAA-rated private placement mortgage-backed security that had been securitized by Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, Bayview Financial). Bayview Financial is a privately-held company and is the majority investor of Bayview Lending Group, LLC (BLG), a commercial mortgage lender in which M&T invested $300 million during 2007. Upon purchase, the mortgage-backed security was placed in the Companys held-to-maturity portfolio, as management determined that it had the intent and ability to hold the security to maturity. Management subsequently reconsidered whether certain other similar mortgage-backed securities previously purchased from Bayview Financial and held in the Companys available-for-sale portfolio should more appropriately be in the held-to-maturity portfolio. Concluding that it had the intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity as well, the Company transferred CMOs having a fair value of $298 million and a cost basis of $385 million from its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio during the third quarter of 2008.  

 The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. Other-than-temporary impairment charges of $86 million (pre-tax) were recognized during 2010. Approximately $68 million of those charges related to privately issued CMOs backed by residential and commercial real estate loans, $6 million related to CDOs backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and $12 million related to American Depositary Shares (ADSs) of AIB. The AIB ADSs were obtained in the 2003 acquisition of a subsidiary of AIB and are held to satisfy options to purchase such shares granted by that subsidiary to certain employees. Factors contributing to the impairment charge included mounting credit and other losses incurred by AIB, the issuance of AIB common stock in lieu of dividend payments on certain preferred stock issuances held by the Irish government resulting in significant dilution of AIB common shareholders, and public announcements by Irish government officials suggesting that increased government support, which could further dilute AIB common shareholders, may be necessary. Other-than-temporary impairment charges of $138 million (pre-tax) were recognized during 2009 related to certain privately issued CMOs and CDOs held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Specifically, $130 million of such impairment charges related to privately issued CMOs and CDOs backed by residential real estate loans and $8 million related to CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of financial institutions. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $153 million related to its holdings of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional other-than-temporary impairment charges of $29 million were recognized in 2008 on CMOs backed by option adjustable rate residential mortgage loans (ARMs) and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of financial institutions. Poor economic conditions, high unemployment and depressed real estate values are significant factors contributing to the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment charges related to CMOs and CDOs. Based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities, as of December 31, 2010, the Company concluded that the remaining declines associated with the rest of the investment securities portfolio were temporary in nature. A further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading Capital. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other earning assets include interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $417 million in 2010, $189 million in 2009 and $198 million in 2008. Reflected in those balances were purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell, which averaged $214 million, $41 million and $96 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The    

 52   
 higher level of resell agreements in 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2008 was due, in part, to the need to fulfill collateral requirements associated with certain municipal deposits. Agreements to resell securities, of which there were none outstanding at the 2010 and 2009 year-ends, are accounted for similar to collateralized loans, with changes in market value of the collateral monitored by the Company to ensure sufficient coverage. The amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.  

 The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits. During 2010 and prior years, the Company considered noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and domestic time deposits under $100,000 as core deposits. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. were also included in core deposits. Average core deposits totaled $43.6 billion in 2010, up from $39.1 billion in 2009 and $31.7 billion in 2008. The K Bank acquisition transaction added $491 million of core deposits on November 5, 2010, while the acquisition transactions in 2009 added $3.8 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition dates. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $217 million in 2010, $337 million in 2009 and $274 million in 2008. Excluding deposits obtained in the acquisition transactions, the growth in core deposits from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010 was due, in part, to the lack of attractive alternative investments available to the Companys customers resulting from lower interest rates and from the economic environment in the U.S. The low interest rate environment has resulted in a shift in customer savings trends, as average time deposits have continued to decline, while average noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits have increased. Funding provided by core deposits represented 73% of average earning assets in 2010, compared with 66% and 55% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2010 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years.  

 Table 8  

 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of FDIC deposit insurance for financial institutions to $250,000 per depositor. That maximum was $100,000 per depositor until 2009, when it was raised to $250,000 temporarily through December 31, 2013. As a result of the permanently increased deposit insurance coverage, effective December 31, 2010 the Company considers time deposits under $250,000 as core deposits. That change added $1.0 billion to core deposits, which aggregated $45.9 billion at December 31, 2010, but did not have an effect on average core deposits for 2010. As previously defined, core deposits totaled $43.1 billion at December 31, 2009.  

 Additional funding sources for the Company included domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys Cayman Islands branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.7 billion in 2010, compared with $2.6 billion in each of 2009 and 2008. Cayman Islands branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $1.0 billion in 2010, $1.7 billion in    

 53   
 2009 and $4.0 billion in 2008. Average brokered time deposits totaled $642 million in 2010, compared with $822 million in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008, and at December 31, 2010 and 2009 totaled $485 million and $868 million, respectively. The Company also had brokered NOW and brokered money-market deposit accounts, which in the aggregate averaged $1.2 billion, $757 million and $218 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The significant increases in such average brokered deposit balances since 2008 reflect continued uncertain economic markets and the desire of brokerage firms to earn reasonable yields while ensuring that customer deposits were fully insured. Cayman Islands branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as alternatives to short-term borrowings. Additional amounts of Cayman Islands branch deposits or brokered deposits may be added in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.  

 The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Reserve and others as sources of funding. Average short-term borrowings were $1.9 billion in 2010, $2.9 billion in 2009 and $6.1 billion in 2008. Included in short-term borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature on the next business day, which averaged $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $4.5 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represented the largest component of average short-term borrowings and were obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Overnight federal funds borrowings totaled $826 million at December 31, 2010 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Average short-term borrowings during 2010, 2009 and 2008 included $31 million, $688 million and $682 million, respectively, of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of New York and the FHLB of Atlanta. Also included in average short-term borrowings in 2009 and 2008 were secured borrowings with the Federal Reserve through their Term Auction Facility (TAF). Borrowings under the TAF averaged $268 million and $238 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings under the TAF at either December 31, 2010 or 2009. The need for short-term borrowings from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has diminished with the continued growth in the Companys core deposits. Also included in average short-term borrowings in 2008 was a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that was paid off during late-2008. The average balance of that borrowing was $463 million in 2008.  

 Long-term borrowings averaged $9.2 billion in 2010, $11.1 billion in 2009 and $11.6 billion in 2008. Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from FHLBs of $4.2 billion in 2010, $6.1 billion in 2009 and $6.7 billion in 2008, and subordinated capital notes of $1.8 billion in 2010 and $1.9 billion in each of 2009 and 2008. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2010, swap agreements were used to hedge approximately $900 million of fixed rate subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $1.2 billion in 2010 and $1.1 billion in each of 2009 and 2008. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged $1.6 billion during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The agreements, which were entered into due to favorable rates available, have various repurchase dates through 2017, however, the contractual maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such repurchase dates.  

 Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as discussed herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable-equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.59% in 2010, compared with 3.21% in 2009. The yield on the Companys earning assets was 4.61% in each of 2010 and 2009, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 38 basis points to 1.02% in 2010 from 1.40% in 2009. The yield on earning assets during 2009 was 108 basis points lower than 5.69% in 2008, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 128 basis points from 2.68% in 2008. The improvement in spread in 2010 as compared with 2009 was due predominantly to lower average rates paid on deposits. The improvement    

 54   
 in spread from 2008 to 2009 reflected lower rates paid on deposits and borrowings. Those lower rates reflected the impact of the sluggish economy and the Federal Reserves monetary policies on both short-term and long-term interest rates. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee noted in December 2010 that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period of time. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Federal Reserves target range for the overnight federal funds rate was 0% to .25%.  

 Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $14.4 billion in 2010, compared with $11.7 billion in 2009 and $8.1 billion in 2008. The significant increases in average net interest-free funds in 2010 and 2009 were largely the result of higher balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, which averaged $13.7 billion in 2010, $11.1 billion in 2009, and $7.7 billion in 2008. In connection with the Provident and Bradford transactions, the Company added noninterest-bearing deposits totaling $946 million at the respective 2009 acquisition dates. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.7 billion in 2010, $3.6 billion in 2009, and $3.4 billion in 2008. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.5 billion in 2010, $1.4 billion in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .25% in 2010, .28% in 2009 and .37% in 2008. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest-free funds in 2010 as compared with 2009 and in 2009 as compared with 2008 resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution.  

 Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.84% in 2010, compared with 3.49% in 2009 and 3.38% in 2008. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin.  

 Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $900 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Under the terms of those swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the agreements at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. Those swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed rate long-term borrowings and, to a lesser extent at December 31, 2009, certain fixed rate time deposits. There were no interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at those respective dates.  

 In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented gains of approximately $97 million at December 31, 2010 and $54 million at December 31, 2009. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged    

 55   
 items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads. The Companys credit exposure as of December 31, 2010 with respect to the estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used for managing interest rate risk has been substantially mitigated through master netting arrangements with trading account interest rate contracts with the same counterparty as well as counterparty postings of $55 million of collateral with the Company. Additional information about swap agreements and the items being hedged is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

 Provision for Credit Losses  

 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $368 million in 2010, compared with $604 million in 2009 and $412 million in 2008. Net loan charge-offs aggregated $346 million in 2010, $514 million in 2009 and $383 million in 2008. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .67% in 2010, compared with 1.01% in 2009 and .78% in 2008. While the Company experienced improvement in its credit quality metrics during 2010, the levels of the provision subsequent to 2007 have been higher than historical levels, reflecting a pronounced downturn in the U.S. economy and significant deterioration in the residential real estate market that began in early-2007. Declining real estate valuations and high levels of delinquencies and charge-offs significantly affected the quality of the Companys residential real estate-related loan portfolios. Specifically, the Companys Alt-A residential real estate loan portfolio and its residential real estate builder and developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of the credit problems related to the turmoil in the residential real estate marketplace. The Company also experienced higher levels of commercial and consumer loan charge-offs over the past three years due to, among other things, higher unemployment levels and the recessionary economy. A summary of the Companys loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10 and in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.

 Table 10  

 LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Loans acquired in connection with the 2010 and 2009 acquisition transactions were recorded at fair value with no carry-over of any previously recorded allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans required estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at current interest rates. The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition reflects estimated future credit losses and other contractually required payments that the Company does not expect to collect. The Company regularly evaluates the reasonableness of its cash flow projections. Any decreases to the expected cash flows require the Company to evaluate the need for an additional allowance for credit losses and could lead to charge-offs of acquired loan balances. Any significant increases in expected cash flows result in additional interest income to be recognized over the then-remaining lives of the loans.   

 57   
 Nonaccrual loans totaled $1.24 billion or 2.38% of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2010, compared with $1.33 billion or 2.56% at December 31, 2009 and $755 million or 1.54% at December 31, 2008. The decline in nonaccrual loans at the end of 2010 as compared with December 31, 2009 was largely attributable to the impact of charge-offs, individually significant payments made in 2010 by a borrower that operates retirement communities and by a borrower that is a consumer finance and credit insurance company, and the transfer to real estate and other foreclosed assets of $98 million of collateral related to a commercial real estate loan that was placed in nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2009. Those reductions were partially offset by additional loans being transferred to nonaccrual status. In particular, in the fourth quarter of 2010 such transfers included an $80 million relationship with a residential builder and developer and $66 million of commercial construction loans to an owner/operator of retirement and assisted living facilities. Major factors contributing to the rise in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2008 to the 2009 year-end were a $209 million increase in commercial loans and leases and a $319 million increase in commercial real estate loans, including a $113 million rise in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The continuing turbulence in the residential real estate marketplace has resulted in depressed real estate values and high levels of delinquencies, both for loans to consumers and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The sluggish U.S. economy has resulted in generally higher levels of nonaccrual loans than historically experienced by the Company.  

 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $270 million or .52% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2010, compared with $208 million or .40% at December 31, 2009 and $159 million or .32% at December 31, 2008. Those loans included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $214 million, $193 million and $114 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled $191 million at December 31, 2010, $176 million at December 31, 2009 and $108 million at December 31, 2008. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that totaled $11 million at December 31, 2010, $13 million at December 31, 2009 and $5 million at December 31, 2008. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.

 NONPERFORMING ASSET AND PAST DUE, RENEGOTIATED AND IMPAIRED LOAN DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Predominately residential mortgage loans.  

  (b)    Accruing loans that were impaired at acquisition date and recorded at fair value.   

 Loans obtained in the 2010 and 2009 acquisition transactions that were impaired at the date of acquisition were recorded at estimated fair value and are generally delinquent in payments, but, in accordance with GAAP the Company continues to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans. The carrying amount of such loans was $97 million at December 31, 2010, or approximately .2% of total loans.  

 In an effort to assist borrowers, the Company modified the terms of select loans secured by residential real estate, largely from the Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans. Included in loans outstanding at December 31, 2010 were $308 million of such modified loans, of which $117 million were classified as nonaccrual. The remaining modified loans have demonstrated payment capability consistent with the modified terms and, accordingly, were classified as renegotiated loans and were accruing interest at the 2010 year-end. Loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates (generally from thirty to forty years) and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. In accordance with GAAP, the modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. Modified residential real estate loans totaled $292 million at December 31, 2009, of which $108 million were in nonaccrual status. The Company has not generally granted loan modifications that involved a reduction of loan principal balance.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $65 million in 2010, $172 million in 2009 and $94 million in 2008. The higher charge-offs experienced during 2009 were largely the result of a few individually significant charge-offs in that year, including a $45 million partial charge-off of an unsecured loan to a single customer in the commercial real estate sector and a $42 million partial charge-off of a relationship with an operator of retirement communities. Commercial loans and leases in nonaccrual status were $187 million at December 31, 2010, $322 million at December 31, 2009 and $114 million at    

 59   
 December 31, 2008. The decline from December 31, 2009 to the 2010 year-end reflects $62 million of payments related to a single borrower that operates retirement communities and the payoffs of a $37 million loan to a consumer finance and credit insurance company and a $36 million loan to a borrower in the commercial real estate sector. The rise in nonaccrual commercial loans from the 2008 year-end to December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of general economic conditions on borrowers abilities to repay loans. Specifically contributing to that increase were the additions of the relationship to a borrower that operates retirement communities ($41 million), a $37 million loan to a consumer finance and credit insurance company, the loan to a borrower in the commercial real estate sector ($36 million) and a $22 million loan to a business in the health care sector.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $118 million, $121 million and $112 million, respectively. Reflected in 2010s charge-offs were $71 million of loans to residential real estate builders and developers, compared with $92 million in 2009 and $100 million in 2008. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $682 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $638 million at December 31, 2009 and $319 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in such loans in 2010 reflects a $40 million rise in nonperforming loans to homebuilders and developers and the addition of $66 million of construction loans to an owner/operator of retirement and assisted living facilities. Those factors were partially offset by the removal from this category of a loan collateralized by real estate in New York City that was initially placed on nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2009. Following a $7 million charge-off, the remaining $98 million of that loans carrying value was transferred to Real Estate and Other Foreclosed Assets in the second quarter of 2010. Contributing to the rise in commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status from December 31, 2008 to the 2009 year-end were an increase of $113 million in such loans to residential homebuilders and developers and the loan collateralized by real estate in New York City ($104 million). At December 31, 2010 and 2009, loans to residential homebuilders and developers classified as nonaccrual aggregated $362 million and $322 million, respectively, compared with $209 million at December 31, 2008. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off loans to residential real estate builders and developers as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 is presented in table 12.  

 Table 12  

 RESIDENTIAL BUILDER AND DEVELOPER LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED DISCOUNT  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes approximately $53 million of loans not secured by real estate, of which approximately $16 million are in nonaccrual status.   

 Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries, were $61 million in 2010, $92 million in 2009 and $63 million in 2008. Nonaccrual residential real estate loans at the end of 2010 totaled $279 million, compared with $281 million and $256 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Depressed real estate values and high levels of delinquencies have contributed to the higher than historical levels of residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual at the three most recent year-ends and to the elevated levels of charge-offs, largely in the Companys Alt-A portfolio. Net charge-offs of Alt-    

 60   
 A loans were $34 million in 2010, $52 million in 2009 and $44 million in 2008. Nonaccrual Alt-A loans aggregated $106 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $112 million and $125 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $192 million, $178 million and $108 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government-related entities. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 is presented in table 13.  

 Net charge-offs of consumer loans during 2010 were $102 million, representing .87% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $129 million or 1.10% in 2009 and $114 million or 1.03% in 2008. Automobile loans represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of automobile loans were $32 million during 2010, $56 million during 2009 and $51 million during 2008. Consumer loan charge-offs also included recreational vehicle loans of $23 million, $25 million and $21 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $31 million during each of 2010 and 2008, and $39 million during 2009. Nonaccrual consumer loans were $91 million at each of December 31, 2010 and 2009, representing .79% and .75%, respectively, of outstanding consumer loans, compared with $66 million or .60% at December 31, 2008. Included in nonaccrual consumer loans and leases at the 2010, 2009 and 2008 year-ends were: indirect automobile loans of $32 million, $39 million and $21 million, respectively; recreational vehicle loans of $13 million, $15 million and $14 million; and outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, including second lien, Alt-A loans, of $43 million, $33 million and $29 million, respectively. At the 2010, 2009 and 2008 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent 30-89 days totaled $120 million, $141 million and $118 million, respectively, or 1.04%, 1.17%, and 1.07% of outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $4 million at each of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and $1 million at December 31, 2008. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 is presented in table 13.

 Information about past due and nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2010 is also included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the impact of declining residential real estate values in the Companys portfolio of loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the Companys portfolio of Alt-A residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis.  

 Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2010 in light of: (i) residential real estate values and the level of delinquencies of residential real estate loans; (ii) the sluggish economic conditions in many of the markets served by the Company; (iii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and (v) the amount of loan growth experienced by the Company. Considerable concerns exist about economic conditions in both national and international markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; high levels of unemployment; the impact of economic conditions on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty about possible responses to state and local government budget deficits. Although the U.S. economy experienced recession and weak economic conditions during recent years, the impact of those conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in the traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate New York and central Pennsylvania. Approximately one-half of the Companys loans are to customers in upstate New York and Pennsylvania. Home prices in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania were largely unchanged in 2009 and 2010, in contrast to declines in values in many other regions of the country. Therefore, despite the conditions, as previously described, the most severe credit issues experienced by the Company have been centered around residential real estate, including loans to builders and developers of residential real estate, in areas other than New York State and Pennsylvania. In response, the Company has conducted detailed reviews of all loans to residential real estate builders and developers that exceeded $2.5 million. Those credit reviews often resulted in commencement of intensified collection efforts, including foreclosure. During 2009 and 2010, the Company also experienced increases in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans, in part due to builders and developers of residential real estate. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans. On a quarterly basis, the Companys loan review department reviews commercial loans and commercial real estate loans that are classified as Special Mention or worse. Meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and Senior Management to discuss each of the relationships. Borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrowers outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation, and the Companys potential courses of action are reviewed. To the extent that these loans are collateral-dependent, they are evaluated based on    

 63   
 the fair value of the loans collateral as estimated at or near the financial statement date. As the quality of a loan deteriorates to the point of classifying the loan as Special Mention, the process of obtaining updated collateral valuation information is usually initiated, unless it is not considered warranted given factors such as the relative size of the loan, the characteristics of the collateral or the age of the last valuation. In those cases where current appraisals may not yet be available, prior appraisals are utilized with adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of subsequent declines in value as determined by line of business and/or loan workout personnel in the respective geographic regions. Those adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the Companys loan review department. Accordingly, for real estate collateral securing larger commercial and commercial real estate loans, estimated collateral values are based on current appraisals and estimates of value. For non-real estate loans, collateral is assigned a discounted estimated liquidation value and, depending on the nature of the collateral, is verified through field exams or other procedures. In assessing collateral, real estate and non-real estate values are reduced by an estimate of selling costs. With regard to residential real estate loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan work-out staff and further refined its loss identification and estimation techniques by reference to loan performance and house price depreciation data in specific areas of the country where collateral that was securing the Companys residential real estate loans was located. For residential real estate-related loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties.  

 Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios. Reflecting the factors and conditions as described herein, the Company has experienced historically high levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs of residential real estate-related loans, including first and second lien Alt-A mortgage loans and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The Company has also experienced higher than historical levels of nonaccrual commercial real estate loans in 2009 and 2010. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.  

 In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and detailed or intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. In quantifying incurred losses, the Company considers the factors and uses the techniques described herein. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more and has been placed in nonaccrual status. Those impaired loans are evaluated for specific loss components. Modified loans, including smaller balance homogenous loans, that are considered to be troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the present value of the loans expected cash flows. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired.   

 64   
 The inherent base level loss components of the Companys allowance for credit losses are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral values, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. In assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management also gives consideration to such factors as customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as national and local economic conditions including: (i) the comparatively poorer economic conditions and unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, that result in such regions generally experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location; and (iii) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans.  

 In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on internally and externally prepared valuations. In recent years, valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes in loans and, as a result, in changes to assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality. Accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were weak, but stabilizing, during 2010, indicative of a sluggish economy. For example, during 2010, private sector employment declined in most market areas served by the Company. Such declines were generally similar to the national average decline of 0.5%. Private sector employment in 2010 declined 0.5% in upstate New York, 0.7% in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company and 0.3% in Maryland, but increased by 0.4% in Greater Washington D.C. Private employment in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company declined by 4.2% in 2009, while employment in the Maryland and Greater Washington D.C. regions fell by 4.0% and 2.9%, respectively, compared with the national average of a 5.2% decrease. In New York City, private sector employment increased by .2% in 2010, however, unemployment rates there remain elevated and are expected to continue at above historical levels during 2011. At the end of 2010 there remained significant concerns about the pace of national economic recovery from the recession, high unemployment, real estate valuations, high levels of consumer indebtedness, volatile energy prices and state and local government budget deficits. Those factors are expected to act as a significant drag on the national economy in 2011.  

 The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the    

 65   
 Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance and other risks associated with the Companys loan portfolio which may not be specifically allocable.  

 A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 14. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components, including the impact of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans. As described in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired were $1.3 billion at each of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $214 million at December 31, 2010 and $244 million at December 31, 2009. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .13% of gross loans outstanding at each of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The declines in the unallocated portion of the allowance since 2007 reflect managements continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques, which has increased the precision of its calculation of the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. However, given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of real estate loans and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Furthermore, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is included in note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Table 14  

 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2010 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $903 million or 1.74% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2010, compared with $878 million or 1.69% at December 31, 2009 and $788 million or 1.61% at December 31, 2008. The ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases at December 31, 2010 reflects the impact of loans obtained in 2010 associated with the K Bank transaction and in 2009 from the Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions that have been recorded at estimated fair value based on estimated future cash flows expected to be received on those loans. Those cash flows reflect the impact of expected defaults on customer repayment performance. As a result, and as required by GAAP, there was no carry-over of the allowance for credit losses recorded by K Bank, Provident or Bradford. The allowance for credit losses at    

 66   
 December 31, 2010 related to the Companys legacy loans (that is, total loans excluding loans acquired during 2010 in the K Bank transaction and during 2009 in the Provident and Bradford transactions) expressed as a percentage of such legacy loans was 1.82%, compared with 1.83% at December 31, 2009. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein and the Companys loan charge-off policies. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonaccrual loans at the end of 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 73%, 66% and 104%, respectively. Given the Companys position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the Companys allowance for credit losses, nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the allowance. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.  

 In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows the methodology described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality:  

       For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 15% increase in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk grades resulting in a 20% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were:  

       For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $79 million that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $24 million reduction could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors.  

 Investor-owned commercial real estate loans secured by retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2010. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2010. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $107 million at December 31, 2010, or .2% of total loans and leases.  

 Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled to $220 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $95 million at December 31, 2009 and $100 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in 2010 resulted from the second quarter addition of $98 million of the previously discussed commercial real estate property located in New York City, and from higher residential real estate loan defaults and additions from residential real estate development projects. At December 31, 2010, exclusive of that $98 million commercial real estate property, 74% of the remaining $122 million of foreclosed assets were comprised of residential real estate-related properties.   

 67   
 Other Income  

 Other income totaled $1.11 billion in 2010, compared with $1.05 billion in 2009. Reflected in such income were net losses on investment securities (including other-than-temporary impairment losses), which totaled to $84 million in 2010 and $137 million in 2009. During 2010, other-than-temporary impairment charges of $86 million were recognized related to certain of the Companys privately issued CMOs, CDOs and AIB ADSs. Similar charges of $138 million were recognized in 2009 related to certain of the Companys privately issued CMOs and CDOs. Also, reflected in noninterest income were the $28 million gain recognized on the K Bank acquisition transaction in 2010 and the $29 million gain recognized on the Bradford acquisition transaction in 2009. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment securities and those acquisition-related gains, noninterest income was $1.16 billion in each of 2010 and 2009. Higher revenues in 2010 related to commercial mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts, credit-related fees and other revenues from operations were offset by lower revenues from residential mortgage banking, brokerage services and M&Ts trust business.  

 Other income in 2009 was 12% higher than the $939 million earned in 2008. As noted above, reflected in other income in 2009 were net losses from bank investment securities of $137 million, compared with net losses of $148 million in 2008 (including $182 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses). The impairment charges recognized in 2008 related to certain of the Companys CMOs, CDOs and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses from both years and the $29 million gain associated with the Bradford acquisition transaction in 2009, other income of $1.16 billion in 2009 was 6% higher than $1.09 billion in 2008. Contributing to that improvement were higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions and a smaller loss related to M&Ts equity in the operations of BLG. Partially offsetting those factors were declines in trust and brokerage services income.  

 Mortgage banking revenues were $185 million in 2010, $208 million in 2009 and $156 million in 2008. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multi-family loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  

 Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees and income, were $127 million in 2010, $166 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. The decline in such revenues in 2010 from 2009 reflects the impact of lower origination volumes, the Companys decision to retain for portfolio a higher proportion of originated loans rather than selling them, and increased costs associated with obligations to repurchase certain mortgage loans previously sold. The higher revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 were attributable to significantly higher origination activity, due largely to refinancing of loans by consumers in response to relatively low interest rates, and wider margins associated with that activity.  

 New commitments to originate residential mortgage loans to be sold were approximately $4.1 billion in 2010, compared with $6.1 billion in 2009 and $4.8 billion in 2008. Similarly, closed residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $4.2 billion in 2010, $6.2 billion in 2009 and $4.4 billion in 2008. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights (net of the impact of costs associated with obligations to repurchase mortgage loans originated for sale) and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled to a gain of $43 million in 2010, compared with gains of $79 million in 2009 and $31 million in 2008.  

 The Company is contractually obligated to repurchase previously sold loans that do not ultimately meet investor sale criteria related to underwriting procedures or loan documentation. When required to do so, the Company may reimburse loan purchasers for losses incurred or may repurchase certain loans. Since early 2007 when the Company recognized a $6 million charge related to declines in market values of previously sold residential real estate loans that the Company could have been required to repurchase,    

 68   
 the Company has regularly reduced residential mortgage banking revenues by an estimate for losses related to its obligations to loan purchasers. The amount of those charges varies based on the volume of loans sold, the level of reimbursement requests received from loan purchasers and estimates of losses that may be associated with previously sold loans. During 2010 the Company received increased requests from loan purchasers for reimbursement. The Company has considered those requests in assessing the estimated impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Residential mortgage banking revenues during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were reduced by approximately $30 million, $10 million and $4 million, respectively, related to the actual or anticipated settlement of repurchase obligations from loan purchasers.  

 Loans held for sale that are secured by residential real estate totaled $341 million and $530 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre-determined rates were $458 million and $162 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010, $936 million and $631 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009 and $898 million and $871 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Net unrealized gains on residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $11 million and $15 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $6 million at December 31, 2008. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in a net decrease in revenue of $5 million in 2010 and net increases in revenue of $9 million and $13 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 Late in the third quarter of 2010, the Company began to originate certain residential real estate loans to be held in its loan portfolio, rather than continuing to sell such loans. The loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines. Retaining these residential real estate loans is expected to largely offset the impact of the declining investment securities portfolio resulting from maturities and pay-downs of residential mortgage-backed securities while providing high quality assets earning a reasonable yield. That decision resulted in a reduction of residential mortgage banking revenues of approximately $11 million in 2010.  

 Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $80 million in 2010, compared with $82 million in 2009 and $81 million in 2008. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $27 million in 2010 and $29 million in each of 2009 and 2008. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others aggregated $21.1 billion at December 31, 2010, $21.4 billion a year earlier and $21.3 billion at December 31, 2008, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $5.2 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of any applicable valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $118 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $141 million and $143 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $50 thousand and $22 million at the 2009 and 2008 year-ends, respectively. There was no similar valuation allowance at December 31, 2010. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $26 million, $40 million and $58 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In addition, at December 31, 2010 capitalized servicing rights included $9 million of servicing rights for $3.6 billion of residential real estate loans that were purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is provided in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $58 million in 2010, $42 million in 2009 and $39 million in 2008. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $40 million in 2010 and $27 million in each of 2009 and 2008. The higher revenues in 2010 reflected higher loan origination volumes. As compared with 2008, improved margins in 2009 were offset by a decline in loan origination volume. Commercial mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately    

 69   
 $1.6 billion in 2010, compared with $1.1 billion in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008. Loan servicing revenues totaled $18 million in 2010, $15 million in 2009 and $12 million in 2008. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets aggregated $43 million at December 31, 2010, $33 million at December 31, 2009 and $26 million at December 31, 2008. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $8.1 billion, $7.1 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and included $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $276 million and $73 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010, $303 million and $180 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009 and $408 million and $252 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $204 million, $123 million and $156 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 Service charges on deposit accounts rose 2% to $478 million in 2010 from $469 million in 2009. That improvement resulted largely from the full-year impact of 2009 acquisition transactions and increased debit card fees resulting from higher transaction volumes. Those positive factors were partially offset by the impact of new regulations that went into effect during the third quarter of 2010. The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators have adopted regulations requiring expanded disclosure of overdraft and other fees assessed to consumers and have issued guidance that requires consumers to elect to be subject to fees for certain deposit account transactions which began on July 1, 2010 for new customers and on August 15, 2010 for pre-existing customers. The Company engaged in an outreach program to customers, particularly those who are frequent users of overdraft services, to ensure they understood such services and to allow them the opportunity to continue to receive those services. Nevertheless, the Company estimates that these regulations resulted in a reduction of service charges on deposit accounts in 2010 of approximately $35 million and expects that the full-year 2011 impact of the regulations on such revenues will be approximately $65 million to $80 million. Deposit account service charges in 2008 were $431 million. The 9% increase in those revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 was predominately due to the impact of the Provident acquisition in May 2009. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has proposed new regulations related to debit card interchange rates that would also have a significant negative impact on revenues earned by financial institutions on debit card transactions. It is difficult to know what the final regulations will require and when they will become effective and, accordingly, the Company cannot estimate the impact that such regulations will have on its results of operations.  

 Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income declined 5% to $123 million in 2010 from $129 million in 2009. During 2008, trust income totaled $156 million. Contributing to the lower levels of such income in 2010 and 2009 as compared with 2008 were the impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds and the impact of fee waivers by the Company in order to pay customers a yield on their investments in proprietary money-market mutual funds. Those waived fees were approximately $18 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. Waived fees in 2008 were not significant. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, aggregated $113.4 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $111.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Trust assets under management were $13.2 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Companys proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $7.7 billion and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

 Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $50 million in 2010, $58 million in 2009 and $64 million in 2008. The decline in such revenues in 2010 as compared with 2009 was attributable to lower sales of annuity products. The decrease in revenues in 2009 as compared with the previous year was largely attributable to lower sales of mutual fund and annuity products. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $27 million in 2010, $23 million in 2009 and $18 million in 2008. The rise in gains from 2009 to 2010 was due to higher new volumes of interest rate swap agreement transactions    

 70   
 executed on behalf of commercial customers. The higher revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 were due to increases in market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $16 million in 2010, compared with $10 million in 2009 and $21 million in 2008. Those fluctuations related predominantly to changes in new volumes of interest rate swap agreement transactions executed on behalf of commercial customers. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $35 million and $36 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases or decreases in the market values of such assets were $3 million and $4 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared with losses of $12 million in 2008. A largely offsetting impact on expenses resulting from corresponding increases or decreases in liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations.  

 Including other-than-temporary impairment losses, the Company recognized net losses on investment securities of $84 million during 2010, compared with $137 million and $148 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other-than-temporary impairment charges of $86 million, $138 million and $182 million were recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized impairment charges during 2010 of $68 million related to certain privately issued CMOs backed by residential and commercial real estate loans, $6 million related to CDOs backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and other entities, and a $12 million write-down of AIB ADSs. The AIB ADSs were obtained in a prior acquisition of a subsidiary of AIB and are held to satisfy options to purchase such shares granted by that subsidiary to certain of its employees. During 2009, the Company recognized impairment charges on certain privately issued CMOs backed by residential real estate loans of $128 million and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of $10 million. The impairment charges recognized in 2008 included write-downs of $153 million related to preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $29 million related to CMOs and CDOs in the investment securities portfolio, and were partially offset by a gain of $33 million related to the mandatory redemption of common shares of Visa during the first quarter of that year. Each reporting period the Company reviews its impaired investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For equity securities, such as the Companys holding of AIB ADSs and its investment in the preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Company considers various factors to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary, including the duration and extent of the decline in value, the factors contributing to the decline in fair value, including the financial condition of the issuer as well as the conditions of the industry in which it operates, and the prospects for a recovery in fair value of the equity security. For debt securities, the Company analyzes the creditworthiness of the issuer or reviews the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. For debt securities backed by pools of loans, such as privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company estimates the cash flows of the underlying loan collateral using forward-looking assumptions of default rates, loss severities and prepayment speeds. Estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to estimate bond-specific cash flows to determine the ultimate collectibility of the bond. If the present value of the cash flows indicates that the Company should not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a bond or if the Company intends to sell the bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell the bond before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized. If an other-than-temporary impairment loss is deemed to have occurred, the investment securitys cost basis is adjusted, as appropriate for the circumstances. Additional information about other-than-temporary impairment losses is included herein under the heading Capital.  

 M&Ts share of the operating losses of BLG was $26 million in each of 2010 and 2009, compared with $37 million in 2008. The operating losses of BLG in those years resulted from the disruptions in the privately issued mortgage-backed securities market and higher provisions for losses associated with securitized loans and other loans held by BLG, and costs associated with severance and certain lease    

 71   
 terminations incurred by BLG as it downsized its operations. Despite the credit and liquidity disruptions that began in 2007, BLG had been successfully securitizing and selling significant volumes of small-balance commercial real estate loans until the first quarter of 2008. In response to the illiquidity in the marketplace since that time, BLG reduced its originations activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its contingent liquidity sources. As a result of past securitization activities, BLG is entitled to cash flows from mortgage assets that it owns or that are owned by its affiliates and is also entitled to receive distributions from affiliates that provide asset management and other services. Accordingly, the Company believes that BLG is capable of realizing positive cash flows that could be available for distribution to its owners, including M&T, despite a lack of positive GAAP-earnings. In assessing M&Ts investment in BLG for other-than-temporary impairment at December 31, 2010, the Company projected no further commercial mortgage origination and securitization activities by BLG. With respect to mortgage assets held by BLG and its affiliates, M&T estimated future cash flows from those assets using various assumptions for future defaults and loss severities to arrive at an expected amount of cash flows that could be available to distribute to M&T. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted-average assumption of projected default percentage on the underlying mortgage loan collateral supporting those mortgage assets was 31% and the weighted-average loss severity assumption was 66%. Lastly, M&T considered different scenarios of projected cash flows that could be generated by the asset management and servicing operations of BLGs affiliates. M&T is contractually entitled to participate in distributions from those affiliates. Such estimates were derived from company-provided forecasts of financial results and through discussions with their senior management with respect to longer-term projections of growth in assets under management and asset servicing portfolios. M&T then discounted the various projections using discount rates that ranged from 8% to 17%. Upon evaluation of those results, management concluded that M&Ts investment in BLG was not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010. Nevertheless, if BLG is not able to realize sufficient cash flows for the benefit of M&T, the Company may be required to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge in a future period for some portion of the $220 million book value of its investment in BLG. Information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other revenues from operations totaled $355 million in 2010, compared with $325 million in 2009 and $300 million in 2008. Contributing to the 9% improvement from 2009 to 2010 were a $12 million rise in letter of credit and other credit-related fees and increases in merchant discount and credit card fees, underwriting and investment advisory fees, and other miscellaneous fees and revenues. Reflected in other revenues from operations in 2010 and 2009 were merger-related gains of $28 million and $29 million, respectively, related to the K Bank and Bradford transactions. The improvement from 2008 to 2009 reflects the $29 million Bradford-related gain recognized in 2009 offset, in part, by modest declines in other miscellaneous fees and revenues.  

 Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees totaled $112 million, $100 million and $97 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The rise in such fees from 2009 to 2010 was due largely to higher income from providing letter of credit and loan syndication services. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $50 million in 2010 and $49 million in each of 2009 and 2008. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $46 million in 2010 and $40 million in each of 2009 and 2008. The increased revenues in 2010 were largely attributable to higher transaction volumes related to merchant activity and usage of the Companys commercial credit card product. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $40 million in 2010, $42 million in 2009 and $31 million in 2008. Automated teller machine usage fees aggregated $18 million in 2010, $19 million in 2009 and $17 million in 2008.  

 Other Expense  

 Other expense aggregated $1.91 billion in 2010, compared with $1.98 billion in 2009 and $1.73 billion in 2008. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $58 million, $64 million and $67 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $771 thousand in 2010, $89 million in    

 72   
 2009 and $4 million in 2008. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.86 billion in 2010, up 2% from $1.83 billion in 2009. That increase was largely attributable to higher costs for professional services, advertising and promotion, occupancy expenses related to the acquired operations of Provident, and a $22 million reduction of the allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009. There was no change to that impairment allowance for the year ended December 31, 2010. Reflected in noninterest operating expenses in 2010 was the full-year impact of the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford. Partially offsetting the higher costs in 2010 were declines in expenses related to foreclosed real estate properties and FDIC assessments. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.66 billion in 2008. The most significant factors for the rise in operating expenses from 2008 to 2009 were costs associated with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford, a $90 million increase in FDIC assessments (including approximately $9 million relating to deposits from Provident and Bradford) and higher foreclosure-related expenses. The impact of those increases was mitigated by a reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $22 million in 2009, as compared with an addition to that valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008.  

 Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $1.00 billion in each of 2010 and 2009, compared with $957 million in 2008. Increased incentive compensation costs and the full-year impact of the 2009 acquisition transactions in 2010 were largely offset by a $10 million decline in merger-related salaries and employee benefits expenses that consisted predominantly of severance expense for Provident employees. The higher expense levels in 2009 as compared with 2008 reflect the impact of the 2009 acquisition transactions. Also contributing to the increased expenses in 2009 were higher costs for providing medical and pension benefits. Stock-based compensation totaled $54 million in each of 2010 and 2009, and $50 million in 2008. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 12,802 at December 31, 2010, compared with 13,639 and 12,978 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $66 million in 2010, $60 million in 2009 and $52 million in 2008. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was $38 million in 2010, $32 million in 2009 and $23 million in 2008. Included in those amounts are $14 million in 2010, $11 million in 2009 and $10 million in 2008 for a defined contribution pension plan that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment.  

 The Companys 2010 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long-term rate of return on assets of 6.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.50%; and a discount rate of 5.75%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the discount rate    

 73   
 would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which was assumed. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $233 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $14 million in 2010, $10 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2008.  

 GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost, are to be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2010, the combined benefit obligations of the Companys defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $171 million. Of that amount, $43 million was related to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and $128 million related to non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are generally not funded until benefits are paid. The Company was required to have a net pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans that was at least equal to $171 million at December 31, 2010. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2010 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of $199 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby shareholders equity) by $121 million. The result of this was a year-over-year increase of $6 million to the required minimum postretirement benefit liability from the $193 million recorded at December 31, 2009. After applicable tax effect, the $6 million increase in the minimum required liability decreased accumulated other comprehensive income in 2010 by $4 million from the prior year-end amount of $117 million. The $6 million increase to the liability was the result of losses that occurred during 2010 resulting from actual experience differing from actuarial assumptions and from changes in those assumptions. Those losses reflect a reduction in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans at December 31, 2010 as compared with a year earlier, offset by actual investment returns in the qualified defined benefit pension plan that exceeded expected returns. In determining the benefit obligation for defined benefit postretirement plans the Company used a discount rate of 5.25% at December 31, 2010 and 5.75% at December 31, 2009. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2010 to 5.0% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans) of $35 million. Under that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment at December 31, 2010 would have been $234 million, rather than the $199 million that was actually recorded, and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010 would have been $142 million, rather than the $121 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 5.50% would have decreased the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by $33 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2010 would have been $166 million rather than the $199 million actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been $101 million rather than $121 million. The Company was not required to and did not make any contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2010. During the second quarter    

 74   
 of 2009, the Company elected to contribute 900,000 shares of common stock of M&T having a fair value of $44 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan. During 2008, the Company made cash contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plan totaling $140 million. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company also provides a retirement savings plan (RSP) that is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $25 million in 2010, $24 million in 2009 and $23 million in 2008.  

 Expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $62 million in 2010, $56 million in 2009 and $47 million in 2008. Expense associated with providing medical and other postretirement benefits was $4 million in each of 2010 and 2009 and $5 million in 2008.  

 Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $856 million in 2010, up 3% from $835 million in 2009. Contributing to that increase were higher costs for professional services, advertising and promotion, occupancy expenses related to the full-year impact of the acquired operations of Provident, and a $22 million reduction of the allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009. There was no change in such impairment allowance in 2010. Partially offsetting the factors described above were decreased costs related to foreclosed real estate properties and FDIC assessments in 2010. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $700 million in 2008. Higher FDIC deposit assessments were a significant contributor to the rise in those expenses from 2008 to 2009. In total, FDIC assessments in 2009 were $97 million, including a $33 million special assessment in the second quarter, compared with $7 million in 2008. Also contributing to the higher level of operating expenses in 2009 as compared with 2008 were costs associated with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford and expenses related to the foreclosure process for residential real estate properties. A $15 million reversal in the first quarter of 2008 of an accrual established in the fourth quarter of 2007 for estimated losses stemming from certain litigation involving Visa also contributed to the year-over-year variance. Partially offsetting those factors was the impact of partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009 of $22 million, compared with additions to the valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008.  

 Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes was $357 million in 2010, compared with $139 million in 2009 and $184 million in 2008. The effective tax rates were 32.6%, 26.8% and 24.9% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income taxes in 2008 reflect the resolution in that year of previously uncertain tax positions related to the Companys activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007 that allowed the Company to reduce its accrual for income taxes in the third quarter of 2008 by $40 million. The effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large but infrequently occurring items. For example, although the merger-related expenses incurred during 2009 are predominantly deductible for purposes of computing income tax expense, those charges had an impact on the effective tax rate because they lowered pre-tax income relative to the amounts of tax-exempt income and other permanent differences that impact the effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of (i) other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008; (ii) net merger-related gains of $27 million in 2010 and net merger-related expenses of $60 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2008; and (iii) the credit to income tax expense noted above of $40 million in 2008, the Companys effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 would have been 33.0%, 30.3%, and 32.1%, respectively.  

 The Companys effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed    

 75   
 by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 International Activities  

 The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $113 million at December 31, 2010 and $62 million at December 31, 2009. Such assets included $107 million and $55 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Deposits in the Companys branch in the Cayman Islands totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. M&T Bank opened a full-service commercial branch in Ontario, Canada during the second quarter of 2010. Loans and deposits at that branch as of December 31, 2010 were $63 million and $4 million, respectively.  

 Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity  

 As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.  

 Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 77% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2010, compared with 72% and 60% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The substantial increases in the amount of earning assets financed by core deposits at the 2010 and 2009 year-ends as compared with December 31, 2008 were the result of significantly higher levels of core deposits, largely due to higher noninterest-bearing deposits. Additionally, as of December 31, 2010 the Company changed it definition of core deposits to include time deposits below $250,000, as already noted, to reflect a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act which permanently increased the maximum amount of FDIC insurance for financial institutions to $250,000 per depositor. That maximum had been $100,000 per depositor until 2009, when it was temporarily raised to $250,000 through 2013. The impact of including time deposits with balances of $100,000 to $250,000 added $1.0 billion to the Companys core deposits total at December 31, 2010.  

 The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, Cayman Islands branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and others. At December 31, 2010, M&T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $6.0 billion. Outstanding borrowings under FHLB credit facilities totaled $2.9 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such borrowings were secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately $9.9 billion at December 31, 2010. The amounts of those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under such lines of credit at December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009.  

 The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys capital as defined by Federal regulators. Information about the Companys borrowings is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial    

 76   
 institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were $826 million and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In general, those borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already noted, Cayman Islands branch deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Cayman Islands branch deposits also generally mature on the next business day and totaled $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Outstanding brokered time deposits at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were $485 million and $868 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was 20 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. The Company also had brokered NOW and brokered money-market deposit accounts which aggregated $1.3 billion and $618 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher level of such deposits at the 2010 year-end resulted from higher demand for these deposits due to the unsettled economy and the need for brokerage firms to ensure that customer deposits are fully insured while earning a yield on such deposits.  

 The Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 15. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

 Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $107 million and $19 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

 The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2010 are summarized in table 17. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2010 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities and senior notes payable. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures are included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2009.

 Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.  

 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Companys core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $900 million. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are    

 81   
 not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.  

 Table 20 displays as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.  

 Table 20  

 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income.  

 Table 21 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.

 Changes in fair value of the Companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to the Companys investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of such securities is presented herein under the heading Capital and in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have also included forward and futures contracts related to mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The fair values of the offsetting trading positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts is presented in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities.  

 The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes aggregated $12.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $769 million and $608 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities were $524 million and $333 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010 and $387 million and $302 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Included in    

 83   
 trading account assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $35 million and $36 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $36 million and $38 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income.  

 Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions associated with the Companys trading activities. Additional information about the Companys use of derivative financial instruments in its trading activities is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Capital  

 Shareholders equity was $8.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and represented 12.29% of total assets, compared with $7.8 billion or 11.26% at December 31, 2009 and $6.8 billion or 10.31% at December 31, 2008. Included in shareholders equity at each of those dates was $600 million of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and warrants to purchase M&T common stock issued on December 23, 2008 as part of the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. The financial statement value of that preferred stock was $579 million at December 31, 2010, $573 million at December 31, 2009 and $567 million at December 31, 2008. Provident also participated in that program on November 14, 2008. As a result, Providents $151.5 million of preferred stock related thereto was converted to M&T Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, with warrants to purchase M&T common stock. The estimated fair value ascribed to the Series C Preferred Stock was $129 million on the May 23, 2009 acquisition date. The financial statement value of the Series C Preferred Stock was $135 million and $131 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The holder of the Series A and Series C preferred stock is entitled to cumulative cash dividends of 5% per annum for five years after the date of initial issuance and 9% per annum thereafter, payable quarterly in arrears. That preferred stock is redeemable at the option of M&T, subject to regulatory approval. M&T also obtained another series of preferred stock as part of the Provident acquisition that was converted to $26.5 million of M&T Series B Mandatory Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The 26,500 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into 433,148 shares of M&T common stock on April 1, 2011. The Series B Preferred Stock pays dividends at a rate of 10% per annum on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, payable quarterly in arrears. The estimated acquisition date fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was approximately equal to that stocks $26.5 million redemption value. Further information concerning M&Ts preferred stock can be found in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Common shareholders equity was $7.6 billion, or $63.54 per share, at December 31, 2010, compared with $7.0 billion, or $59.31 per share, at December 31, 2009 and $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share, at December 31, 2008. Tangible equity per common share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $33.26 at December 31, 2010, compared with $28.27 and $25.94 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 6.19% at December 31, 2010, compared with 5.13% and 4.59% at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Reconciliations of total common shareholders equity and tangible common equity as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented in table 2. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the ratio of average total shareholders equity to average total assets was 11.85%, 10.79% and 9.88%, respectively. The ratio of average common shareholders equity to average total assets was 10.77%, 9.81% and 9.86% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 Shareholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, and    

 84   
 adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities, net of applicable tax effect, were $85 million, or $.71 per common share, at December 31, 2010, compared with net unrealized losses of $220 million, or $1.86 per common share, at December 31, 2009, and $557 million, or $5.04 per common share, at December 31, 2008. Such unrealized losses represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale, including the remaining unamortized unrealized losses on investment securities that have been transferred to held-to-maturity classification. Information about unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Reflected in net unrealized losses at December 31, 2010 were pre tax-effect unrealized losses of $312 million on available-for-sale investment securities with an amortized cost of $1.7 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized gains of $231 million on securities with an amortized cost of $3.8 billion. The pre-tax effect unrealized losses reflect $252 million of losses on privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.4 billion and an estimated fair value of $1.1 billion (considered Level 3 valuations) and $38 million of losses on trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions having an amortized cost of $127 million and an estimated fair value of $89 million (generally considered Level 2 valuations).  

 The Companys privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale are generally collateralized by prime and Alt-A residential mortgage loans as depicted in table 22. Information in the table is as of December 31, 2010. As with any accounting estimate or other data, changes in fair values and investment ratings may occur at any time.  

 Table 22  

 PRIVATELY ISSUED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE (a)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    All information is as of December 31, 2010.   

 Reflecting the credit stress associated with residential mortgage loans, trading activity for privately issued mortgage-backed securities has been dramatically reduced. In estimating values for such securities, the Company was significantly restricted in the level of market observable assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Because of the relative inactivity and lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company considers the estimated fair value associated with its holdings of privately issued mortgage-backed securities to be Level 3 valuations. To assist in the determination of fair value for its privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company engaged two independent pricing sources at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. In April 2009, guidance was provided by the FASB for estimating fair value when the volume and level of trading activity for an asset    

 85   
 or liability have significantly decreased. In consideration of that guidance, the Company performed internal modeling to estimate the cash flows and fair value of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The Companys internal modeling techniques included discounting estimated bond-specific cash flows using assumptions about cash flows associated with loans underlying each of the bonds. In estimating those cash flows, the Company used conservative assumptions as to future delinquency, default and loss rates in order to mitigate exposure that might be attributable to the risk that actual future credit losses could exceed assumed credit losses. Differences between internal model valuations and external pricing indications were generally considered to be reflective of the lack of liquidity in the market for privately issued mortgage-backed securities. To determine the most representative fair value for those bonds under current market conditions, the Company computed values based on judgmentally applied weightings of the internal model valuations and the indications obtained from the average of the two independent pricing sources. Weightings applied to internal model valuations were generally dependent on bond structure and collateral type, with prices for bonds in non-senior tranches generally receiving lower weightings on the internal model results and greater weightings of the valuation data provided by the independent pricing sources. As a result, certain valuations of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities were determined by reference to independent pricing sources without adjustment. The average weight placed on internal model valuations at December 31, 2010 was 34%, compared with a 66% weighting on valuations provided by the independent sources. Generally, the range of weights placed on internal valuations was between 0% and 40%. Further information concerning the Companys valuations of privately issued mortgage-backed securities can be found in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 During 2010 the Company recognized $86 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses including $63 million related to privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $585 million, $6 million related to securities backed largely by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $13 million, $5 million related to commercial mortgage-backed CMOs with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $9 million, and $12 million related to AIB ADSs with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $13 million. In assessing impairment losses for debt securities, the Company performed internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows, which considered the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining levels of subordination. For privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities, the model utilized assumptions about the underlying performance of the mortgage loan collateral considering recent collateral performance and future assumptions regarding default and loss severity. At December 31, 2010, projected model default percentages on the underlying mortgage loan collateral ranged from 1% to 43% and loss severities ranged from 10% to 71%. For bonds in which the Company has recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge, the weighted-average percentage of defaulted collateral was 25% and the weighted-average loss severity was 49%. For bonds without other-than-temporary impairment losses, the weighted-average default percentage and loss severity were 11% and 39%, respectively. Underlying mortgage loan collateral cash flows, after considering the impact of estimated credit losses, were distributed by the model to the various securities within the securitization structure to determine the timing and extent of losses at the bond-level, if any. Despite continuing high levels of delinquencies and losses in the underlying residential mortgage loan collateral, given credit enhancements resulting from the structures of individual bonds, the Company has concluded that as of December 31, 2010 its remaining privately issued mortgage-backed securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Nevertheless, given recent market conditions, it is possible that adverse changes in repayment performance and fair value could occur in 2011 and later years that could impact the Companys conclusions. Management has modeled cash flows from privately issued mortgage-backed securities under various scenarios and has concluded that even if home price depreciation and current delinquency trends persist for an extended period of time, the Companys principal losses on its privately issued mortgage-backed securities would be substantially less than their current fair valuation losses. Information comparing the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.   

 86   
 At December 31, 2010, the Company also had net pre-tax unrealized gains of $5 million on $410 million of trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions, securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and other entities, and other debt securities (including $16 million of net unrealized gains on $111 million of securities using a Level 3 valuation and $11 million of net unrealized losses on $299 million of securities classified as Level 2 valuations). Pre-tax unrealized losses of $29 million existed on $384 million of such securities at December 31, 2009. After evaluating the expected repayment performance of financial institutions where trust preferred securities were held directly by the Company or were within CDOs backed by trust preferred securities obtained in acquisitions, the Company, during 2010 and 2009, recognized pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment losses of $6 million and $8 million, respectively, related to those securities.  

 The Company also holds municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government agencies and certain CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, Bayview Financial), a privately-held specialty mortgage finance company and the majority investor of BLG, in its held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio. The Company purchased certain private placement CMOs during 2008 that had been securitized by Bayview Financial. Given the Companys relationship with Bayview Financial and related entities at that time, the Company reconsidered its intention to hold other CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial with a cost basis of $385 million and a fair value of $298 million and transferred such securities from its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to its held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio. During 2010, the Company recognized a $5 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment loss related to CMOs in the held-to-maturity portfolio having an amortized cost (before impairment charge) of $9 million. Similar to its evaluation of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities, the Company assessed impairment losses on these CMOs by performing internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows, which considered the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels. In total, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio CMOs with an amortized cost basis of $313 million (after impairment charge) and $352 million, respectively, and a fair value of $198 million and $201 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the amortized cost and fair value of CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were $25 million and $22 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2009 were $33 million and $25 million, respectively. Given the credit enhancements within each of the individual bond structures, the Company has determined that the remaining private CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010.  

 The AIB ADSs were obtained in a 2003 acquisition and are held to satisfy options to purchase such shares granted by the acquired entity to certain employees. Factors contributing to the $12 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2010 related to the AIB ADSs included mounting credit and other losses incurred by AIB, the issuance of AIB common stock in lieu of dividend payments on certain preferred stock issuances held by the Irish government resulting in significant dilution of AIB common shareholders, and public announcements by Irish government officials suggesting that increased government support, which could further dilute AIB common shareholders, may be necessary.  

 During 2009 the Company recognized $138 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary losses, including $128 million related to CMOs backed by privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $486 million and $10 million related to CDOs backed largely by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $18 million. During 2008 the Company recognized $182 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary losses, $18 million of which related to privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $20 million and $11 million related to securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $12 million. The remaining $153 million of other-than-temporary impairment in 2008 related to the Companys holdings of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $162 million.  

 As of December 31, 2010, based on a review of each of the remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that the declines in the values of those securities were temporary and that any additional other-than-temporary impairment charges were not appropriate. As of    

 87   
 that date, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any of its impaired securities, that is, where fair value is less than the cost basis of the security. The Company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of the privately issued mortgage-backed securities and other securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the cost basis of those securities to become other-than-temporarily impaired. However, because the unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities have generally already been reflected in the financial statement values for investment securities and shareholders equity, any recognition of an other-than-temporary decline in value of those investment securities would not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition. Any additional other-than-temporary impairment charge related to held-to-maturity securities would result in reductions in the financial statement values for investment securities and shareholders equity. Additional information concerning fair value measurements and the Companys approach to the classification of such measurements is included in note 20 of the Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $121 million, or $1.01 per common share, at December 31, 2010, $117 million, or $.99 per common share, at December 31, 2009, and $174 million, or $1.58 per common share, at December 31, 2008. The decrease in such adjustment at December 31, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008 was predominantly the result of actual investment performance of assets held by the Companys qualified pension plans being significantly better than assumed for actuarial purposes. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company contributed 900,000 shares of M&T common stock having a then fair value of $44 million to the Companys qualified defined benefit pension plan. Those shares were issued from previously held treasury stock. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Cash dividends declared on M&Ts common stock totaled $336 million in 2010, compared with $327 million and $309 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Dividends per common share totaled $2.80 in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. During 2010, cash dividends of $38 million, or $50.00 per share, were declared and paid to the U.S. Treasury on M&Ts Series A ($30 million) and Series C ($8 million) Preferred Stock. Similar dividends of $31 million were declared and paid in 2009. Cash dividends of $3 million and $1 million ($100.00 per share and $50.00 per share) were declared and paid during 2010 and 2009, respectively, on M&Ts Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B and Series C Preferred Stock were created in connection with the Provident transaction. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in 2010, 2009 or 2008.  

 Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. At December 31, 2010, Tier 1 capital included $1.1 billion of trust preferred securities as described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $1.5 billion of subordinated capital notes. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, trust preferred securities will be phased-out of the definition of Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net income during the fourth quarter of 2010 rose 49% to $204 million from $137 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were each $1.59 in the final 2010 quarter, 53% and 51% higher than $1.04 and $1.05 of diluted and basic earnings per common share, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2009. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders equity for the recently completed quarter were 1.18% and 10.03%, respectively, compared with .79% and 7.09%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

 Net operating income totaled $196 million in the recent quarter, compared with $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.52 in the final 2010 quarter, compared with $1.16 in the year-earlier quarter. The annualized net operating returns on    

 88   
 average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in the fourth quarter of 2010 were 1.20% and 18.43%, respectively, compared with .92% and 16.73%, respectively, in the similar 2009 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $8 million and $10 million in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 ($.07 and $.09 per diluted common share, respectively). The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses and the gain associated with the K Bank acquisition transaction totaled to a net gain of $16 million ($27 million pre-tax) or $.14 of diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses related to the Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions was $4 million ($6 million pre-tax) or $.03 of diluted earnings per common share in the final quarter of 2009. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2010 and 2009 are provided in table 24.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 3% to $580 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 from $565 million in the year-earlier quarter. That growth reflects a 14 basis point widening of the Companys net interest margin. The yield on earning assets was 4.58% in each of the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 16 basis points to .97% in the final quarter of 2010 from 1.13% in the corresponding quarter of 2009. The resulting net interest spread was 3.61% in the recent quarter, up 16 basis points from 3.45% in the fourth quarter of 2009. That improvement was largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the Companys net interest margin was .24% in the recent quarter, down slightly from .26% in the year-earlier quarter. That decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. As a result, the Companys net interest margin widened to 3.85% in the final 2010 quarter from 3.71% in the similar quarter of 2009. Average earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $59.7 billion, down 1% from $60.5 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That decline resulted from lower average loans and leases, which decreased 2% to $51.1 billion in the recent quarter from $52.1 billion in 2009s final quarter. Average commercial loan and lease balances were $13.0 billion in the recent quarter, down $514 million or 4% from $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. That decline was the result of generally lower demand for commercial loans throughout most of 2010. Commercial real estate loans averaged $20.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, down $326 million from $21.0 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Average residential real estate loans outstanding rose 8% or $453 million to $5.9 billion in the recent quarter from $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. That increase was predominantly the result of the impact of adopting the already discussed new accounting rules on January 1, 2010 related to non-recourse securitization transactions using qualified special-purpose trusts. Included in the residential real estate loan portfolio were loans held for sale, which averaged $556 million and $497 million in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consumer loans averaged $11.6 billion in the recent quarter, down $558 million, or 5%, from $12.1 billion in the final 2009 quarter. That decline was largely due to lower outstanding automobile and home equity loan balances. Despite sluggish loan demand throughout much of 2010, total loans increased $1.2 billion to $52.0 billion at December 31, 2010 from $50.8 billion at September 30, 2010. That growth was largely attributable to December increases in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans.  

 The provision for credit losses was $85 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2010, compared with $145 million in the year-earlier period. Net charge-offs of loans were $77 million in the final quarter of 2010, representing an annualized .60% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $135 million or 1.03% during the year-earlier quarter. Net charge-offs included: residential real estate loans of $15 million in the recently completed quarter, compared with $21 million a year earlier; loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties of $22 million, compared with $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2009; other commercial real estate loans of $13 million, compared with $11 million a year earlier; commercial loans of $5 million, compared with $31 million in 2009; and consumer loans of $22 million, compared with $32 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  

 Other income totaled $287 million in the recent quarter, up 8% from $266 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net losses on investment securities (including other-than-temporary impairment charges) were $27 million during the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. The losses were predominantly due to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of the Companys privately issued CMOs. Reflected in other income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was the $28 million gain recorded on the K Bank acquisition transaction. Excluding net losses on    

 89   
 investment securities and the merger-related gain, other income was $286 million, down 5% from $300 million in the year-earlier quarter. The most significant contributors to that decline were lower residential mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by higher trading account and foreign exchange gains and letter of credit and other credit-related fees. The decline in residential mortgage banking revenues in the recent quarter reflects lower origination volumes, the Companys decision to retain for portfolio a higher proportion of originated loans rather than selling them, and increased settlements related to obligations to repurchase previously sold loans. Charges against mortgage banking revenues related to such repurchase obligations were $14 million in the recent quarter and $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The lower service charges on deposit accounts reflect the new regulations that went into effect in the third quarter of 2010. The Federal Reserve and other regulators have adopted regulations requiring expanded disclosure of overdraft and other fees assessed to consumers and issued guidance that requires consumers to elect to be subject to fees for certain deposit account transactions that began July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 15, 2010 for pre-existing customers. The Company estimates that these new regulations resulted in a decrease in deposit account service charges of approximately $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  

 Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $469 million, compared with $478 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $13 million and $17 million in the final quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $771 thousand and $6 million in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $455 million in each of the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009. As compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, higher costs for professional services and advertising and promotion in the recent quarter were offset by lower expenses for salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy, and other operating costs. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 was 52.5% and 52.7%, respectively. Table 24 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2010 and 2009.  

 Segment Information  

 In accordance with GAAP, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking.  

 The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services to small businesses and professionals through the Companys branch network, business banking centers and other delivery channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and automated teller machines within markets served by the Company. Services and products offered by this segment include various business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. The Business Banking segment contributed net income of $99 million in 2010, 21% lower than the $124 million recorded in 2009. That decline was predominately due to a $33 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the result of increased net charge-offs of loans. Net income earned in 2008 totaled $120 million. The favorable performance in 2009 as compared with 2008 was due    

 90   
 to higher net interest income of $33 million, largely attributable to higher average deposit and loan balances of $869 million and $416 million, respectively, partially offset by a $20 million increase in total noninterest expenses, reflecting higher FDIC assessments of $10 million, and an $8 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the result of higher net charge-offs of loans. Approximately three-fourths of the higher net interest income was due to the Provident transaction.  

 The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment earned $314 million in 2010, up 31% from $239 million in 2009. The increase in net income in 2010 as compared with 2009 reflects a $60 million decline in the provision for credit losses, due to lower net loan charge-offs, as well as a $51 million rise in net interest income, due to a $2.0 billion increase in average deposit balances and a 26 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans. Net income contributed by this segment in 2008 was $213 million. The higher net income in 2009 as compared with 2008 reflects a $98 million increase in net interest income, primarily due to a $3.0 billion increase in average deposit balances. Approximately 15% of the increase in net interest income was due to the Provident acquisition. Partially offsetting that increase were a $31 million increase in the provision for credit losses, predominately due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and a $15 million rise in FDIC assessments.  

 The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment improved 31% to $203 million in 2010 from $155 million in 2009. Factors contributing to the significant rise in net income include: a $39 million decline in the provision for credit losses, mainly due to lower net charge-offs of loans; a $38 million increase in net interest income; and higher revenues from mortgage banking activities of $13 million, the result of increased loan origination and sales activities. The rise in net interest income was attributable to a 28 basis point expansion of the net interest margin on loans and increases in average deposit and loan balances of $430 million and $249 million, respectively, partially offset by a 57 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits. Partially offsetting the favorable factors were higher noninterest expenses, which include increased personnel-related costs and foreclosure-related expenses of $8 million and $5 million, respectively. In 2008, net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was $164 million. Factors contributing to the 5% decline in net income in 2009 when compared with 2008 were a $69 million increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and higher noninterest expenses of $15 million, including increased FDIC assessments of $4 million. Those increased costs were partially offset by higher net interest income of $59 million, largely attributable to higher average loan and deposit balances of $1.4 billion and $489 million, respectively, and an 18 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans. Approximately one-half of the increase in net interest income was due to the Provident acquisition.  

 The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and Cayman Islands branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are most of the investment securities for which the Company has recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges in each of the last three years and the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans. The Discretionary Portfolio segment incurred net losses of $39 million, $28 million and $48 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in this segments results were other-than-temporary impairment charges of $74 million in 2010, $138 million in 2009 and $182 million in 2008. The impairment charges recorded in 2010 and 2009 predominately related to privately issued CMOs, while the 2008 impairment    

 91   
 charges were largely from the Companys holdings of preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In addition to the impact of impairment charges, the higher net loss incurred in 2010 as compared with 2009 reflects a decrease in net interest income of $114 million, resulting from a 42 basis point narrowing of this segments net interest margin, offset, in part, by a $27 million reduction in the provision for credit losses, due to lower net charge-offs of loans. Factors contributing to this segments lower net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008 were a $44 million decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges, the impact of a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $6 million in 2009, compared with an addition to the valuation allowance of $6 million in 2008, and lower foreclosure-related costs of $10 million. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a $14 million increase in the provision for credit losses, driven by higher net charge-offs, and a $7 million decline in net interest income, reflecting lower average balances of investment securities and loans of $529 million and $290 million, respectively.  

 The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties, although that origination activity has been significantly curtailed. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. This segment recorded net income of $11 million in 2010, compared with net losses of $13 million and $48 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The net losses incurred in 2009 and 2008 reflect significant net charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The improvement of this segments results in 2010 as compared with 2009 was attributable to the following: a $49 million reduction in the provision for credit losses, including a decline in net charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate; lower foreclosure-related expenses of $20 million, the result of updated appraised values on certain previously foreclosed-upon residential real estate development projects in 2009; and an $8 million decrease in personnel-related expenses. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were a $16 million partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance in 2009 (as compared with no change in such allowance in 2010) and a decline in revenues relating to residential mortgage origination and sales activities of $19 million. The lower residential mortgage revenues in 2010 reflect lower origination volumes and increased settlements related to the Companys obligation to repurchase previously sold loans. The lower net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008 was due to: a $55 million rise in noninterest revenues from residential mortgage loan origination activities, due to increased volume and wider margins; the impact of a partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $16 million in 2009, compared with a $10 million addition to such allowance in 2008; and a $13 million increase in net interest income, partly due to a 68 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans. A rise in total noninterest expenses of $43 million (excluding the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance reversal), reflecting higher foreclosure-related costs of $23 million, partially offset those favorable factors.  

 The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers through several delivery channels which include branch offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit products on a nationwide basis through the delivery channels of M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit and credit cards. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. Net income contributed by the Retail Banking segment aggregated $225 million in 2010, down from $237 million in 2009. Lower net interest income of $39 million, the result of a 25 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on deposits, and an $8 million rise in net occupancy expenses contributed to the decline in net income. Those factors were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $21 million (due to lower net charge-offs of loans), a decline in FDIC assessments of $7 million, and higher fees earned for    

 92   
 providing deposit account services of $5 million. Net income for this segment decreased 5% in 2009 from the $250 million earned in 2008. Factors contributing to that decline included: a $42 million increase in FDIC assessments; a rise in the provision for credit losses of $32 million, resulting from higher net charge-offs of consumer loans; and increases in personnel and net occupancy costs of $17 million and $16 million, respectively, related to the operations added with the Provident acquisition. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were a $48 million increase in net interest income and a $34 million rise in fees earned for providing deposit account services to Provident customers. The higher net interest income was due to a $2.4 billion increase in average deposit balances (approximately 60 percent of which was due to the impact of the Provident acquisition) and a 26 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans, offset, in part, by a 26 basis point narrowing of the deposit net interest margin.  

 The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions, M&Ts share of the operating losses of BLG, merger-related gains and expenses resulting from acquisitions and the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $78 million, $335 million and $95 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The improved performance in 2010 as compared with 2009 was largely due to the favorable impact from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses and a net merger-related gain in 2010 of $27 million, compared with net merger-related expenses in 2009 totaling $60 million. The following unfavorable factors contributed to the higher net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008: the impact from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses; $60 million of net merger-related expenses associated with the Provident and Bradford acquisitions recorded in 2009, compared with $4 million of merger-related expenses in 2008 related to acquisition transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2007; Visa-related transactions that were recorded in the first quarter of 2008, including a $33 million gain realized from the mandatory partial redemption of Visa stock owned by M&T Bank and $15 million related to the reversal of Visa litigation-related accruals initially recorded in 2007s fourth quarter; increased personnel costs associated with the business and support units included in the All Other category of $35 million, including higher costs for medical, pension and post-retirement benefits; the impact of a $40 million reduction of income tax expense recorded in 2008s third quarter relating to M&Ts resolution of certain tax issues from its activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007; lower trust income of $28 million; a $16 million increase in FDIC assessments; and a $6 million increase in charitable contributions made to the M&T Charitable Foundation. A $13 million (pre-tax) improvement from M&Ts share of the operating results of BLG (inclusive of interest expense to fund that investment) partially offset the favorable factors.  

 Recent Accounting Developments  

 In June 2009, the FASB amended accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The amended guidance instead requires a reporting entity to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity based on whether the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The amended guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The amended guidance became effective as of January 1, 2010.   

 93   
 Also in June 2009, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance relating to accounting for transfers of financial assets to eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special-purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred assets. The amended guidance became effective as of January 1, 2010. The recognition and measurement provisions of the amended guidance were applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2010, the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special-purpose entities must now be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with applicable consolidation guidance, including the new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities discussed in the previous paragraph.  

 Effective January 1, 2010, the Company included in its consolidated financial statements one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that were included in two separate non-recourse securitization transactions using qualified special-purpose trusts. The effect of that consolidation was to increase loans receivable by $424 million, decrease the amortized cost of available-for-sale investment securities by $360 million (fair value of $355 million), and increase borrowings by $65 million as of January 1, 2010. Information concerning these securitization transactions is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 In January 2010, the FASB amended fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to require disclosure of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and to require separate presentation of information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The amended guidance also clarifies existing requirements that (i) fair value measurement disclosures should be disaggregated for each class of asset and liability and (ii) disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements should be provided. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those years. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 In March 2010, the FASB amended accounting guidance relating to a scope exception for derivative accounting to clarify that only embedded credit derivative features related to the transfer of credit risk in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another should not be analyzed for potential bifurcation from the host contract and separate accounting as a derivative. Embedded credit derivative features in a form other than subordination do not qualify for the scope exception, even if their effects are allocated according to subordination provisions. The guidance was effective at the beginning of the first quarter beginning after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the reporting of the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 In April 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance relating to the effect of a loan modification when the loan is part of a pool that is accounted for as a single asset under the guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality. The amended guidance requires modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool to remain in the pool even if the modification would be considered a troubled debt restructuring. Companies are required to continue to review the pool of assets in which the modified loan is included to determine whether the pool is impaired if the expected cash flows for the pool change. The guidance was effective for prospective modifications of loans accounted for within pools occurring in the first interim or annual period ending on or after July 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the reporting of the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 In July 2010, the FASB issued amended disclosure guidance relating to credit risk inherent in an entitys portfolio of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses. The amended disclosures are required at two disaggregated levels. One level of disaggregation is the portfolio segment which represents the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. The second level of disaggregation is the class of financing receivables which generally represents a disaggregation of a portfolio segment. The amended disclosures    

 94   
 include a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment with the ending balance further disaggregated on the basis of the impairment method, the related recorded investment in each portfolio segment, the nonaccrual status of financing receivables by class, the impaired financing receivables by class, the credit quality indicators of financing receivables at the end of the reporting period by class, the aging of past due financing receivables at the end of the reporting period by class, the nature and extent of troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the period by class and their effect on the allowance for credit losses, the nature and extent of financing receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings within the previous twelve months that defaulted during the reporting period by class and their effect on the allowance for credit losses, and the significant purchases and sales of financing receivables during the reporting period by portfolio segment. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010 and the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Upon initial application, the disclosures are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. The Company has complied with the disclosures required as of December 31, 2010 and intends to comply with the remaining disclosure requirements when they become effective.  

 In October 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance relating to the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, an entity is required to perform Step Two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the reporting of its financial position or results of its operations.  

 In December 2010, the FASB issued amended disclosure guidance relating to the pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period. The amended disclosure states that if an entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company intends to comply with the disclosure requirements when they become effective.  

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements.  

 Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values on loans, collateral securing loans and other assets; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock-based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively, including tax legislation; regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes; protection and    

 95   
 validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi-year contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings, including tax-related examinations and other matters; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support M&T and its subsidiaries future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger, acquisition and investment activities compared with M&Ts initial expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements.  

 These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which M&T and its subsidiaries do business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors.
