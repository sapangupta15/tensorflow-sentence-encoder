Item 1. Business  

Overview  

L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (L-3 Holdings), a Delaware corporation organized in April 1997, derived all of its operating income and cash flows from its wholly-owned subsidiary, L-3 Communications Corporation (L-3 Corp). On December 31, 2016, we completed an internal reorganization to eliminate our holding company structure. Pursuant to the reorganization, L-3 Holdings was merged (the Merger) with and into L-3 Corp, with the subsidiary being the surviving entity in the Merger (the Surviving Entity). Immediately following the completion of the Merger, the name of the Surviving Entity was changed to L3 Technologies, Inc. (the Name Change). 

As a result of the Merger and the Name Change, all outstanding shares of L-3 Holdings common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of common stock of L3 Technologies, Inc., with economic, voting and other rights that are substantially identical. The common stock of L3 Technologies, Inc. commenced trading effective January 3, 2017 (the first trading day of 2017) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LLL, the same ticker symbol previously used by us. 

L3 is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications, logistics and maintenance), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment and security and detection systems. L3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. Our customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), foreign governments, and domestic and international commercial customers.  

We have the following three reportable segments: (1) Electronic Systems, (2) Aerospace Systems and (3) Communication Systems. Effective March 1, 2017, we will realign our Electronic Systems segment in connection with the retirement of the segments president in the second quarter of 2017. The current Electronic Systems segment will be split into two separate segments named (1) Electronic Systems and (2) Sensor Systems. Accordingly, our structure will consist of the following four segments: (1) Aerospace Systems, (2) Communication Systems, (3) Electronic Systems and (4) Sensor Systems. We will report our results under the realigned business segments commencing in the first quarter of 2017 at which time we will restate the corresponding information for prior periods. Financial information for our segments, including sales by geographic area, is included in Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

On December 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our National Security Solutions (NSS) business to CACI International Inc. The transaction was completed on February 1, 2016. NSS provided cybersecurity solutions, high-performance computing, enterprise IT services, analytics and intelligence analysis to the DoD, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, federal civilian agencies and foreign governments. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of NSS are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to L3s continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated sales of $10,511 million, consolidated and segment operating income of $1,008 million and net cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $1,097 million. The table below presents a summary of our 2016 sales by major category of end customer. For a more detailed presentation of our sales by end customer, see Major Customers within this Business section. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Business Strategy  

The goal of our strategy is to build disciplined growth. The key elements of this strategy are summarized in the paragraphs below. Our business strategy is customer-focused and aims to increase shareholder value by strengthening our market positions in aerospace systems, electronic systems, sensor systems and communication systems by leveraging our excellent customer relationships and pursuing adjacent market opportunities, including international sales. We intend to gain market share with innovative and affordable solutions, collaboration across L3s business units and demonstrated past performance that address customer imperatives. We expect that we will continue to focus our business portfolio to emphasize products and systems in our core defense electronics, ISR and Communication businesses. Financially, our emphasis is on growing sales, operating income, earnings per share and cash flow, as well as increasing operating margin. Our goal of disciplined growth involves a flexible and balanced combination of organic growth, cost reductions, and select business acquisitions and divestitures, enabling us to grow the company and also return cash to our shareholders in a balanced and disciplined manner. Our strategy includes the elements discussed below.  

Maintain an Agile Culture of Excellence, Integrity and Accountability. A key part of L3s strategy is our agile, accountable, and results-driven culture that focuses on meeting our customers needs and on achieving L3s strategic goals and growth objectives. L3s culture is made up of diverse people providing creative, innovative and affordable solutions and ideas in an environment that fosters teamwork and collaboration across our business units. Operating with integrity and a commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct and maintaining strong internal controls are foundational elements of our strategy to build and maintain the trust of our customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and communities where we live and work.  

Strengthen and Expand Our Market Positions and Unique Capabilities. We intend to use our existing prime contractor and supplier positions and internal investments to increase our market share, grow our sales organically and continue to build strong businesses with durable discriminators that have a number one or number two market position. We intend to expand our prime contractor roles in select business areas where we have domain expertise, including special operations forces and U.S. Government classified business. We expect to benefit from and expand our supplier positions to multiple bidders by leveraging our customer relationships, pursuing adjacent market opportunities and expanding our content on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) platforms. As an independent supplier of a broad range of products, subsystems and systems in several key business areas, our growth will partially be driven by expanding our share of existing programs and participating in new programs. Teaming arrangements with other prime contractors and platform OEMs is one way we intend to pursue select new business opportunities and expand our content on select platforms. We plan to maintain our diversified and broad business mix with limited reliance on any single contract, follow-on or new business opportunity. While sales to the U.S. Government, especially the DoD, will remain an integral part of L3s business, we also intend to continue to increase our sales to foreign governments and domestic and international commercial businesses. We expect to continue to supplement our organic sales growth by acquiring, on a select basis, businesses that provide attractive returns on investment and add new products, technologies, programs and contracts, or provide access to select DoD, other U.S. Government, international and/or commercial customers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Collaborate to Increase Growth Opportunities through Innovation. We intend to deepen the collaboration among our diversified businesses to develop new business opportunities, combine our leading technologies and deliver the right solutions to our customers quickly. We expect that our core strengths of agility, responsiveness and cost-effectiveness will allow us to continue to provide exceptional performance to our customers. We intend to continue to focus on innovation and research and development, which will allow us to enhance our existing products and to create new and more affordable solutions and products for our customers. 

Leverage Our Excellent Customer Relationships. We intend to maintain and expand our excellent customer relationships. We also intend to continue to leverage our customer relationships and our capabilities, including proprietary technologies, to expand the scope of our products to existing and new customers. We also intend to continue to align our products, services, investments in research and development and business acquisitions to proactively address customer priorities and requirements and invest in growth areas such as aerospace systems, sensor systems, U.S. Government classified business and special operations.  

Increase Margins by Proactively Managing Our Cost Structure and Optimizing Our Business Portfolio. We intend to increase our operating margin by improving productivity and reducing direct contract costs and overhead costs, including general and administrative costs. Our effective management of labor, material, subcontractor and other direct costs is also an important element of cost control and favorable contract performance. We believe that proactively re-sizing our businesses to their anticipated sales, combined with continuous cost improvement, will enable us to increase our cost competitiveness and operating margin and to also selectively invest in new product development, business acquisitions, bids and proposals and other business development activities to win new business. We intend to continue to evaluate our portfolio of businesses to address the needs of a dynamic and demanding market place and to strengthen our core business through select business acquisitions or divestitures.  

Achieve Outstanding Program Performance. We believe that outstanding performance on our existing programs and contracts, in terms of on-budget, on-schedule and satisfying and exceeding technical and other contractual performance requirements, is the foundation for expanding L3s prime contractor and supplier positions and winning new business. We believe that a prerequisite for growing and winning new business is to retain our existing business by successfully meeting the performance criteria included in our contracts. We will continue to focus on delivering superior contract performance with affordable prices to our customers in order to maintain our reputation as an agile and responsive contractor and to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.  

Attract and Retain Skilled Personnel. The success of our businesses is, to a large extent, dependent upon the knowledge and skills of our employees. We intend to continue to attract and retain employees who have management, contracting, engineering and technical skills and who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above.  

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures  

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we used net cash of $388 million, $320 million and $57 million for business acquisitions, respectively. See Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information regarding our business acquisitions and divestitures, including the sale of NSS on February 1, 2016 for a sale price of $547 million.  

Products and Services  

Our three reportable segments provide a wide range of products and services to various customers and are described below. See Part II — Item 7 — Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Reportable Segment Results of Operations and Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements for financial information about each segment.

Aerospace Systems Reportable Segment  

In 2016, Aerospace Systems had net sales of $4,240 million, representing 40% of our total net sales. The businesses in this reportable segment provide products and services for the global ISR and Command, Control and Communications (C3) markets, specializing in signals intelligence (SIGINT) and multi-intelligence platforms, to include full motion video, electro-optical, infrared, and synthetic aperture radars, along with other types of information gathering systems. These strategic and tactical products and services provide the warfighter with the ability to detect, collect, identify, analyze and disseminate information from command centers, communication nodes and air defense systems for real-time situational awareness and response. These products and services also include highly specialized fleet management sustainment and support services, including procurement, systems integration, sensor development, modifications and periodic depot maintenance for ISR and special mission aircraft and airborne systems. We believe that these products and services are critical elements for a substantial number of major C3 and intelligence gathering systems. The businesses in this reportable segment also provide engineering, modernization, upgrades and sustainment, maintenance and logistics support solutions for military and various government aircraft, ground vehicles, personnel equipment and other platforms. These solutions include aerospace and other technical services related to large fleet support, such as repair and overhaul, logistics and supply chain management, primarily for military training, tactical, transport cargo and utility aircraft. We sell these products and services primarily to the DoD and select foreign governments.

Funded Backlog and Orders  

We define funded backlog as the value of funded orders received from customers, less the cumulative amount of sales recognized on such orders. We define funded orders as the value of contract awards received from the U.S. Government, for which the U.S. Government has appropriated funds, plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the U.S. Government. The table below presents our funded backlog, percentage of funded backlog at December 31, 2016, expected to be recorded as sales in 2017 and funded orders for each of our reportable segments and on a consolidated basis.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our funded backlog does not include the full potential value of our contract awards, including those pertaining to multi-year, cost-plus type contracts, which are generally funded on an annual basis. Funded backlog also excludes the potential future orders and related sales from unexercised priced contract options that may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the potential future orders and related sales of purchase orders that we may receive in the future under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements during the term of such agreements.  

Major Customers  

The table below presents a summary of our sales by end customer and the percent contributed by each to our total sales. For additional information regarding domestic and international sales, see Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Direct sales to the end customer represented approximately 67% of our consolidated 2016 sales, and sales as a subcontractor or supplier represented the remaining 33%.  

Our sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the U.S. Government. Various U.S. Government agencies and contracting entities exercise independent and individual purchasing decisions, subject to annual appropriations by the U.S. Congress. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our five largest contracts (revenue arrangements) generated 15% of our consolidated sales and our largest contract  

11  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

(revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM), which is included in our Aerospace Systems segment. Under this contract, which generated approximately 4% of our 2016 sales, we provide maintenance, logistics and other related sustainment support services for rotary wing aircraft assigned to Fort Rucker and satellite units in Alabama. Our period of performance under this contract continues through September 30, 2017. We are one of several contractors expected to bid on the re-competition of this contract and expect an award decision in the second half of 2017. 

Research and Development  

We conduct research and development activities that consist of projects involving applied research, new product and systems development and select concept studies. We employ scientific, engineering and other personnel to improve our existing product lines and systems and develop new products, technologies and systems. At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 8,000 engineers, substantially all of whom hold advanced degrees, who work on company-sponsored research and development efforts and customer funded research and development contracts.  

Company-sponsored (Independent) research and development costs for our businesses that are U.S. Government contractors are allocated to U.S. Government contracts and are charged to cost of sales when the related sales are recognized as revenue. Research and development costs for our commercial businesses are expensed as incurred and are also charged to cost of sales. The table below presents company-sponsored (Independent) research and development expenses incurred for our U.S. Government businesses and our commercial businesses.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Customer-funded research and development costs pursuant to contracts (revenue arrangements) are not included in the table above because they are direct contract costs and are charged to cost of sales when the corresponding revenue is recognized. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our research and development efforts.  

Competition  

While we believe that we are a major provider for many of the products and services we offer to our DoD, government and commercial customers, our businesses generally encounter significant competition.  

Our ability to compete for existing and new business depends on a variety of factors, including:  

 •the effectiveness and innovation of our technologies, systems and research and development programs; 

 •our ability to offer superior program performance at an affordable and competitive cost; 

 •historical, technical, cost and schedule performance; 

 •our ability to attain supplier positions on contracts; 

 •our ability to maintain an effective supplier and vendor base; 

 •our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones, particularly those who have U.S. Government security clearances; 

 •the capabilities of our facilities, equipment and personnel to undertake the business for which we compete; and 

 •our ability to quickly and flexibly meet customer requirements and priorities. 

L3 is an aerospace and defense contractor with a broad and diverse portfolio of products and services. We have prime contractor and subcontractor positions. We supply our products and services to other prime system contractors.  

12  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

However, we also compete directly with other large prime system contractors for: (1) certain products, subsystems and systems, where they have vertically integrated businesses, and (2) niche areas where we are a prime contractor. We also compete with numerous other aerospace and defense contractors, which generally provide similar products, subsystems, systems or services.  

In addition, our ability to compete for select contracts may require us to team with one or more of the other prime system contractors that bid and compete for major platform programs, and our ability to team with them is often dependent upon the outcome of a competition for subcontracts they award.  

Patents and Licenses  

Generally, we do not believe that our patents, trademarks and licenses are material to our operations. Furthermore, most of our U.S. Government contracts generally permit us to use patents owned by other U.S. Government contractors. Similar provisions in U.S. Government contracts awarded to other companies prohibit us from preventing the use of our patents in most DoD work performed by other companies for the U.S. Government.  

Raw Materials  

Although we generated 61% of our 2016 sales from products and systems, our businesses are generally engaged in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. For those businesses that manufacture and sell products and systems, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as a diverse base of third party suppliers and subcontractors. Although certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials, we have not experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes.  

Contracts  

Generally, the sales price arrangements for our contracts are either fixed-price, cost-plus or time-and-material type. Generally, a fixed-price type contract offers higher profit margin potential than a cost-plus type or time-and-material type contract due to the greater levels of risk we assume on a fixed-price type contract.  

On a fixed-price type contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Accounting for the sales on a fixed-price type contract that is covered by contract accounting standards requires the preparation of estimates for: (1) the total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work, and (3) the measurement of progress towards completion. Adjustments to original estimates for a contracts revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change.  

On a cost-plus type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contracts fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship which total allowable costs bear to target cost. Award and incentive fees earned were not material to our results of operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014.  

On a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.  

Substantially all of our cost-plus type contracts and time-and-material type contracts are with U.S. Government customers, while sales to commercial customers are transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements and are included in our fixed-price contract type sales. The table below presents the percentage of our total sales generated from each contract type.

Regulatory Environment  

Most of our revenue arrangements with agencies of the U.S. Government, including the DoD, are subject to unique procurement and administrative rules. These rules are based on both laws and regulations, including the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation, that: (1) impose various profit and cost controls, (2) regulate the allocations of costs, both direct and indirect, to contracts and (3) provide for the non-reimbursement of unallowable costs. Unallowable costs include, but are not limited to, lobbying expenses, interest expenses and certain costs related to business acquisitions, including, for example, the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses arising from fair value increases to the historical carrying values of acquired assets. Our contract administration and cost accounting policies and practices are also subject to oversight by government inspectors, technical specialists and auditors. See Part I — Item 1A — Risk Factors for a discussion of certain additional business risks specific to our government contracts.  

Our U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. Investigations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, disallowance of certain costs, or fines and penalties. As is common in the U.S. defense industry, we are subject to business risks, including changes in the U.S. Governments procurement policies (such as greater emphasis on competitive procurement), governmental appropriations, national defense policies or regulations, service modernization plans and availability of funds. A reduction in expenditures by the U.S. Government for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide, lower margins resulting from increasingly competitive procurement policies, a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us or the incurrence of substantial contract cost overruns could materially adversely affect our business.  

In 2016, sales under foreign military sales (FMS) agreements, which are included in the international (foreign governments) category in the Major Customers table above, were $547 million, or 5% of our total consolidated sales. FMS agreements are made directly between the U.S. Government and foreign governments. In such cases, because we serve only as the supplier, we do not have unilateral control over the terms of the agreements. Certain of our sales are direct commercial sales to foreign governments. These sales are subject to U.S. Government approval and licensing under the Arms Export Control Act. Legal restrictions on sales of sensitive U.S. technology also limit the extent to which we can sell our products to foreign governments or private parties.  

All of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.  

Environmental Matters  

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. We continually assess our obligations and compliance with respect to these requirements.  

We have also assessed the risk of environmental contamination for our various manufacturing facilities, including our acquired businesses and, where appropriate, have obtained indemnification, either from the sellers of  

14  

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

those acquired businesses or through pollution liability insurance. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and permits. We believe our current expenditures will allow us to continue to be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws, based upon available internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe there are no environmental loss contingencies that, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

Employees  

At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 38,000 full-time and part-time employees, 84% of whom were located in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 22% are covered by approximately 85 separate collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The success of our business is, to a large extent, dependent upon the knowledge of our employees and on the management, contracting, engineering and technical skills of our employees. In addition, our ability to grow our businesses, obtain additional orders for our products and services and to satisfy contractual obligations under certain of our existing revenue arrangements is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with clearances of top-secret and above. Historically, we have renegotiated labor agreements without significant disruptions to operating activities, and we believe that relations with our employees are positive.
