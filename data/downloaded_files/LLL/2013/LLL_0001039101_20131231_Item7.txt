Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Overview and Outlook  

Explanatory Note  

We are filing this Amendment No. 1 (this Amendment or Form 10-K/A) to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 following the completion of the internal review of our Aerospace Systems segment, which is discussed below. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the Form 10-K) was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on February 25, 2014, and subsequently updated for the re-alignment of our segments that occurred in the first quarter of 2014 and reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 2, 2014 (the 8-K and, together with the Form 10-K, the Original Form 10-K). At the time of filing our Form 10-K, we determined that our disclosure controls and procedures (DC&P) and our internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) were each effective as of December 31, 2013.  

This Amendment revises Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, as it relates to our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our DC&P and our report on ICFR. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 26, 2014, as part of the findings from the internal review of the Aerospace Systems segment we identified certain material weaknesses in our ICFR that existed as of December 31, 2013. Solely as a result of these material weaknesses, we have concluded that our DC&P and ICFR were not effective as of December 31, 2013.  

In addition to the revision in Part II, Item 9A described above, this Amendment revises previously issued financial statements for: (1) accounting adjustments due to the internal review at our Aerospace Systems segment, (2) accounting error related to a sales-type lease transaction for flight simulator systems within our Electronic Systems segment, and (3) previously identified immaterial errors already recognized in our financial statements but not recorded in the appropriate periods. The accounting errors related to the sales-type lease transaction and immaterial out of period amounts are not related to the internal review at our Aerospace Systems segment.

Controls and Procedures: As part of the internal review of our Aerospace Systems segment, discussed below, we identified material weaknesses in our ICFR. The material weaknesses, further discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, on page 73, are: (1) the Company did not maintain an effective control environment at its Aerospace Systems segment, with respect to: (i) inadequate execution of existing controls around the annual review and approval of contract (revenue arrangement) estimates; (ii) not following established Company accounting policies, controls and procedures, and (iii) intentional override of numerous transactional and monitoring internal controls at our Army Sustainment division; and (2) Company personnel did not perform reviews of certain employee concerns regarding violations of our accounting policies and ICFR in a sufficient and effective manner.  

Internal Review of Aerospace Systems Segment: We conducted an internal review related to instances of misconduct and accounting errors at our Aerospace Systems segment. This review was conducted with the assistance of outside legal and accounting advisors, and has been completed. As a result of the internal review, we identified and recorded aggregate pre-tax charges as follows: (1) $60 million for 2013, (2) $25 million for 2012, (3) $5 million for 2011, and (4) $4 million for periods prior to 2011. Furthermore, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and six month periods ended June 27, 2014 and the 2014 First Quarter 10-Q/A also include aggregate pre-tax charges related to the internal review of Aerospace Systems segment. The aggregate pre-tax charge related to the internal review of Aerospace Systems segment for the three months ended March 28, 2014 is approximately $20 million and for the three months ended June 27, 2014 is approximately $55 million.  

The adjustments related to the internal review only affected the Logistics Solutions and Platform Systems sectors of the Aerospace Systems segment. The cumulative aggregate adjustments attributable to the Logistics Solutions sector are approximately $117 million, and at the Platform Systems sector are approximately $52 million. The Logistics Solutions sector adjustments relate to: (1) losses of $69 million with respect to the U.S. Army C-12 fixed-price maintenance and logistics support contract due to cost overruns inappropriately deferred, sales invoices inappropriately prepared, and the failure to timely and accurately perform contract estimates at completion and valuation assessments of inventories and receivables, at our Army Sustainment Division, and (2) accounting errors of $48 million in connection with the valuation of inventories and receivables, as well as the correction for certain accruals on other logistics support contracts. The Platform Systems sector adjustments are primarily due to: (1) losses of $37 million on two aircraft modification contracts and two contracts for rotary wing sub-assemblies and parts, and (2) write-offs of deferred costs of $15 million to design and test aerostructures for a new commercial aircraft.  

Sales-Type Lease Transaction: We routinely perform on-site accounting and internal control review procedures on a rotational basis. As part of a previously planned review of our Simulation & Training business in the Electronic Systems segment and unrelated to the internal review at the Aerospace Systems segment, we evaluated the accounting treatment related to a sales-type lease transaction with the U.S. Army for rotary wing flight simulator systems. The period of performance under this contract began in 2004 and ends in 2023. Based on the results of this evaluation, we have adjusted our previously issued financial statements to: (1) increase interest income accretion on the net investment related to this sales-type lease transaction by an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $5 million for 2013, $3 million for each of 2012 and 2011 and $12 million for periods prior to 2011, and (2) decrease sales by approximately $7 million for 2013 and decrease cost of sales by approximately $7 million for 2013 and $5 million for periods prior to 2011. Furthermore, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and six month periods ended June 27, 2014 and the 2014 First Quarter 10-Q/A also include an increase in interest income accretion of $2 million and a decrease in sales of approximately $8 million and related decrease in cost of sales by approximately $7 million.  

Out of Period Amounts: We had identified various out of period amounts included in our previously issued financial statements that were deemed to be immaterial individually and in the aggregate. In prior periods, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 650-10-S99 and S55 (formerly Staff Accounting Bulletins (SAB) No. 99 and No. 108), Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, we concluded that these errors were, individually, and in the aggregate, not material, quantitatively or qualitatively, to the financial  

35  

Table of Contents 

 statements in the period recorded or to the relevant prior periods. Accordingly, we recorded these errors in our financial statements in the period that the error was identified. We are, on a voluntary basis, revising our previously issued financial statements to correct for these errors already recognized in our financial statements but not recorded in the appropriate periods to reflect them in the appropriate period. These out of period amounts were not discovered as part of the internal review of the Aerospace Systems segment discussed above, but rather represent previously identified errors resulting from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in application of generally accepted accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared, as defined in ASC 250-10-20 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. We are, therefore, not treating these amounts as changes in estimates. These errors consist of: (1) increases in development and material costs related to Broadband Communication Systems that were recorded in the first quarter of 2013 but should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012, (2) a sub-contractor subscription deposit that was recorded as sales and income in the fourth quarter of 2012 but should have been amortized to sales and income during 2013, (3) costs accrued in the fourth quarter of 2012 for goods or services received in the first quarter of 2013, (4) several unrecorded liabilities that were recorded in the first quarter of 2013 but should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012, (5) a correction of accrued vacation that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 but should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first, second and third quarters of 2013, and (6) a warranty reserve reduction recorded in the third quarter of 2012 that should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011.  

With respect to each of the immaterial out of period amounts included in the Companys previously issued financial statements, the table below presents the: (1) nature of the adjustments, (2) applicable segment, (3) amount of increase (or decrease) to sales and operating income, (4) period recorded and (5) correct period.

The table below presents the impact of the revisions discussed above on sales and pre-tax income in total, for the six month period ended June 27, 2014, years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and for the years ended prior to December 31, 2011.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For additional information regarding the effect the adjustments above had on previously issued financial statements, see Note 3 on page F-15.  

In accordance with ASC 650-10-S99 and S55, we performed an analysis to determine if the impact of the amounts disclosed above were material to previously issued financial statements. Based on that analysis, we believe that previously issued financial statements are not materially misstated on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. However, we believe that correcting these errors in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2014 would, in the aggregate, cause a material misstatement to forecasted pre-tax income and net income for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014. Accordingly, we are correcting these errors by revising our previously issued financial statements to record all the adjustments in the table above in the appropriate period.  

This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gives effect to the revisions for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. See Note 3, Revisions to Previously Issued Financial Statements to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report, which accompany the financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K/A for further detail. In addition, for information regarding findings with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and related remedial actions, see Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of this Form 10-K/A.  

L-3s Business  

L-3 is a prime contractor in aerospace systems and national security solutions. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. Our customers include the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) and its prime contractors, U.S. Government intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of State (DoS), allied international governments, and domestic and international commercial customers.  

In the first quarter of 2014, we reorganized our business segments to better align our organizational structure with customer priorities and increase operational efficiencies. After the realignment, L-3s structure consists of the following four segments: Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and National Security Solutions, as further described below.  

Aerospace Systems: combines the operations of the former Platform & Logistics Solutions (P&LS) segment with Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Systems. ISR Systems was part of the former Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C3ISR) segment. Aerospace Systems delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems. Aerospace Systems had 2013 net sales of $4,551 million.  

37  

Table of Contents 

Electronic Systems: includes all of its previous businesses historically included in this segment except the Microwave Products businesses, which are now part of Communication Systems. Electronic Systems provides a broad range of components, products, subsystems, systems and related services for military and commercial customers in several niche markets across several business areas. These businesses include marine & power systems, marine systems international, sensor systems, precision engagement and training, aviation products, warrior systems, security & detection and space & propulsion. Electronic Systems had 2013 net sales of $4,598 million.  

Communication Systems: combines the operations of the Microwave Products businesses, which were previously part of the Electronic Systems segment, with the operations of the Networked and Secure Communications Products businesses, previously part of the former C3ISR segment. Communication Systems delivers products and services for the global communications market, specializing in strategic and tactical airborne, space, ground and sea-based communication systems. Communication Systems had 2013 net sales of $2,178 million.  

National Security Solutions: remains unchanged. National Security Solutions will continue to provide cybersecurity solutions, high-performance computing, enterprise IT services, analytics and intelligence analysis. National Security Solutions had 2013 net sales of $1,295 million.  

We have made certain reclassifications for matters specific to the segment realignment discussed above. Financial information with respect to each of the Companys segments is included in Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

On July 17, 2012, L-3 completed the spin-off of its subsidiary, Engility Holdings, Inc. (Engility) to L-3s shareholders. As a result of the spin-off, the results of operations and cash flows of the Engility businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. References to financial data are to L-3s continuing operations, unless specifically noted. See Spin-off of Engility within this section for additional information.  

We generated sales of $12,622 million and $13,107 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and our primary customer was the DoD. The table below presents a summary of our sales by end customer and the percent contributed by each to our total sales.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Most of our contracts (revenue arrangements) with the U.S. Government are subject to U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency audits and various cost and pricing regulations, and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. Multiyear U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable. International government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant international government.

Business Environment  

U.S. Government Markets. Sales to U.S. Government customers represented 73% of our 2013 sales, and were primarily to DoD customers, which comprised 68% of our sales. Therefore, our annual sales are generally highly correlated to changes in U.S. Government spending levels, especially DoD budget levels.  

The DoD budget peaked in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 (FY 2010) at $690 billion and has declined since. The total DoD budget for FY 2013 was $584 billion, which declined 10% compared to the FY 2012 budget, with the base budget 5% lower than FY 2012 and the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget 29% lower than FY 2012. The total DoD enacted budget for FY 2014 is $583 billion, which is $1 billion lower than FY 2013.  

The enacted FY 2013 and FY 2014 DoD budgets comply with the sequestration cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), as amended by The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA), which was enacted on January 2, 2013. ATRA delayed the effective date of the BCA sequester cuts by two months to March 1, 2013 and reduced the sequester cuts to the FY 2013 DoD budget by $9 billion to approximately $41 billion. The actual FY 2013 sequester cuts announced by the DoD in June 2013 were further reduced by the Administration to approximately $37 billion, with $6 billion of such reductions applied to prior-year unobligated DoD budget balances. This resulted in a $31 billion sequester cut to the total enacted DoD budget for FY 2013 as compared to the FY 2013 Proposed Budget Request (PBR), submitted to Congress in February 2012, and also compares favorably to the originally anticipated $50 billion sequester cut to the FY 2013 DoD budget. After ATRA, the sequestration cuts for the FY 2014 DoD budget were supposed to be $46 billion and approximately $52 billion per year from FY 2015 to FY 2018.  

On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) into law, which reduced DoD budget uncertainty for FY 2014 and FY 2015 by increasing BCA spending caps, and lowering sequester cuts to the DoD base budget by $22 billion for FY 2014 and $9 billion for FY 2015. Additionally, Congress also increased the FY 2014 OCO budget by $6 billion more than the amount included in the FY 2014 PBR.  

The table below presents the FY 2011 through FY 2014 enacted DoD budgets, the FY 2015 DoD budget adjusted for the BBA, and the Administrations DoD budget projections for FY 2016 to FY 2018, as provided in the FY 2014 PBR. The PBR, submitted to Congress in April 2013, reduced the annual sequestration cuts by approximately $52 billion each year for FY 2015 through FY 2018.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

While we believe that L-3 is well positioned to benefit from several of the DoDs focus areas, declining DoD budgets will generally pressure and possibly reduce funding for some of our contracts, which could reduce our sales and operating income and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty continues to exist, even with the recent passage of the BBA, regarding how sequestration cuts will be implemented in future fiscal year DoD budgets and what challenges this may present for the defense industry, including L-3, our customers and suppliers. Furthermore, while members of Congress and the Administration continue to discuss  

39  

Table of Contents 

 various options to address sequestration and the U.S. Governments overall fiscal challenges, we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts. We do not believe the FY 2014 sequester cuts to the DoD budget will have a significant negative impact on our results of operations or cash flows for the year ending December 31, 2014. However, depending on how future sequestration cuts are implemented, we believe that sequestration could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the future. In addition, declining DoD budgets due to sequestration or other reductions could also potentially trigger non-cash goodwill impairment charges depending on how these reductions impact each of our reporting units. See Critical Accounting Policies  Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets within this section.  

International and Commercial Markets. Sales to end customers other than the U.S. Government represented 27% of our 2013 sales. These sales are generally affected by international government security and military priorities, as well as the fiscal situations of our international government end customers, global economic conditions for our commercial end markets and our competitive success in winning new business and increasing market share.  

Key Performance Measures  

The primary financial performance measures that we use to manage our businesses and monitor results of operations are sales and operating income trends. Management believes that these financial performance measures are the primary growth drivers for our earnings and cash flow per common share. Generally, in evaluating our businesses and contract performance, we focus on net sales, operating income and operating margin, and not by type or amount of operating costs.  

One of our primary business objectives is to increase sales from organic growth and select business acquisitions. We define organic sales growth as the increase or decrease in sales for the current period compared to the prior period, excluding sales in the: (1) current period from business acquisitions that are included in our actual results of operations for less than twelve months, and (2) prior period from business and product line divestitures that are included in our actual results of operations for the twelve-month period prior to the divestiture date. We expect to supplement, strengthen and enhance our existing businesses by selectively acquiring businesses that: (1) add important new technologies and products, (2) provide access to select customers, programs and contracts and (3) provide attractive returns on investment. Another important financial performance measure that we use is operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of sales, because sales growth combined with operating margin levels determine our operating income levels.  

Sales Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2013, consolidated net sales of $12,622 million declined by 3.7%, comprised of organic sales decline of 4.3%, partially offset by net sales from business acquisitions of 0.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Our average annual sales growth for the five years ended December 31, 2013 was 0.8%, as average annual organic sales declined by approximately 0.3% and average annual sales growth from business acquisitions, net of divestitures, was approximately 1.1%. See Results of Operations, including segment results below for further discussion of sales.  

For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, our largest contract (revenue arrangement) in terms of annual sales was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM), which is included in our Aerospace Systems segment. Under this contract, which generated approximately 4% of our 2013, 2012 and 2011 sales, we provide maintenance, logistics and other related sustainment support services for rotary wing aircraft assigned to Fort Rucker and satellite units in Alabama. Our period of performance, including unexercised annual options, continues through September 30, 2017.  

We derived approximately 68% of our 2013 sales from DoD customers and, as a result, our sales are highly correlated to DoD budget levels. DoD budgets are a function of several factors and uncertainties beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, U.S. military engagements, changing national security and defense requirements, geo-political developments, actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for  

40  

Table of Contents 

 defense budgets, and sequestration and other DoD budget reductions. Any of these factors could result in a significant increase, decrease or redirection of DoD budgets and impact L-3s future results of operations, including our sales and operating income growth rates. Additionally, L-3s future results of operations will be affected by our ability to retain our existing business, including our revenue arrangements with DoD customers, and to successfully re-compete for existing business and compete for new business, which largely depends on: (1) our successful performance on existing contracts, (2) the effectiveness and innovation of our technologies and research and development activities, (3) our ability to offer better program performance than our competitors at an affordable cost, and (4) our ability to retain our employees and hire new ones, particularly those employees who have U.S. Government security clearances. We expect our 2014 consolidated sales to decline by approximately 5% compared to 2013, primarily due to the declines in DoD budgets.  

Segment Operating Income Trends. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our segment operating income was $1,212 million, a decrease of 7.3% from $1,308 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our segment operating income as a percentage of sales (segment operating margin) was 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of 40 basis points from 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012. See Results of Operations, including segment results below for a discussion of operating margin.  

While we continue to undertake cost management actions, such as reducing our indirect costs, resizing select business units, and improving our productivity and contract performance in an effort to maintain or even increase operating margin, these efforts may not be successful. Changes in the competitive environment and DoD procurement practices, reductions to the DoD budget, lower consolidated sales, and changes in our annual pension expense and severance costs could result in lower operating margin. Furthermore, select business acquisitions and select new business, including contract renewals and new contracts, could have lower operating margins than L-3s operating margins on existing business and contracts. While our 2013 consolidated operating margin declined compared to 2012, we expect our 2014 annual consolidated operating margin to increase as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower expected pension expense.  

Other Events  

Spin-off of Engility. On July 17, 2012, L-3 completed the spin-off of its subsidiary, Engility, to L-3s shareholders. The spin-off was a tax-free distribution to L-3 shareholders for U.S. federal tax purposes, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. L-3 shareholders of record on July 16, 2012 (the record date) received one share of Engility common stock for every six shares of L-3 common stock held on the record date. Engility began trading as an independent publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on July 18, 2012.  

In connection with the spin-off, Engility made a cash distribution of $335 million to L-3. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $250 million of our 6 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (6 3/8% 2015 Notes) on July 26, 2012 and the remaining proceeds were used primarily to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. There was no gain or loss recognized by us as a result of the spin-off transaction.  

Prior to the completion of the spin-off, L-3 and Engility entered into a Distribution Agreement dated July 16, 2012 and several other agreements that govern certain aspects of our relationship with Engility following the spin-off. These agreements generally provide that each party is responsible for its respective assets, liabilities and obligations, including employee benefits, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities, following the spin-off, whether accrued or contingent. The agreements also describe certain services that L-3 provided to Engility that were substantially completed by December 31, 2013.  

As a result of the spin-off, the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest, results of operations and cash flows of the Engility businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We incurred transaction expenses in connection with the spin-off of $19 million ($14 million after income taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $9 million ($7 million after income taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2011, which have been included in discontinued operations. In addition, we allocated interest expense for debt not directly attributable or related to L-3s other operations of $14 million and $31 million to discontinued operations  

41  

Table of Contents 

 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Interest expense was allocated in accordance with the accounting standards for discontinued operations and was based on the ratio of Engility net assets to the sum of: (1) total L-3 consolidated net assets and (2) L-3 consolidated total debt.  

Engilitys statement of operations data, which has been classified as discontinued operations, is provided in the table below. See Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2012 Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. On February 3, 2012, we amended and restated our $1 billion Revolving Credit Facility, which extended the expiration date to February 3, 2017. The terms of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility are substantially consistent with the terms of this facility prior to its amendment and restatement except that: (1) provisions that previously limited the ability of L-3 Communications to pay dividends, repurchase L-3 Holdings common stock and make other distributions with respect to any capital stock were eliminated, (2) a provision that previously limited the ability of L-3 Communications to make investments in L-3 Holdings was made less restrictive and (3) the cost of borrowings, loan commitment fees and letter of credit fees were reduced. In addition, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility provides for uncommitted incremental revolving facilities and additional term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million. See Note 11 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the amendment of our $1 billion Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility.  

Debt Repurchases, Issuances and Redemptions. On July 26, 2012, (the redemption date), L-3 Communications used a portion of the proceeds from the spin-off of Engility to redeem $250 million of L-3 Communications 6 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (6 3/8% 2015 Notes) at a redemption price of 102.125%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, up to but not including the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the 6 3/8% 2015 Notes, the Company recorded a debt retirement charge of $8 million ($5 million after income tax, or $0.05 per diluted share).  

On October 15, 2012 (the redemption date), L-3 Communications redeemed the remaining outstanding $250 million of its 6 3/8% 2015 Notes at a redemption price of 101.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, up to but not including the redemption date. In connection with the redemption, the Company recorded a debt retirement charge of approximately $5 million ($3 million after income tax, or $0.03 per diluted share).  

On February 2, 2011, we repurchased approximately $11 million of our CODES as a result of the exercise by the holders of their contractual right to require us to repurchase their CODES.  

On February 7, 2011, L-3 Communications issued $650 million in principal amount of 4.95% Senior Notes that mature on February 15, 2021 (2021 Senior Notes). The 2021 Senior Notes were issued at a discount of $4 million. On March 9, 2011, the net cash proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem L-3 Communications $650 million 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due January 15, 2015 (5 7/8% 2015  

42  

Table of Contents 

 Notes). In connection with the redemption of the 5 7/8% 2015 Notes, we recorded a debt retirement charge of $18 million ($11 million after income taxes, or $0.10 per diluted share).  

On November 22, 2011, L-3 Communications issued $500 million in principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes that mature on November 15, 2016 (2016 Senior Notes). The 2016 Senior Notes were issued at a discount of $4 million. On December 22, 2011, the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $500 million of L-3 Communications 6 3/8% 2015 Notes. In connection with the redemption of the 6 3/8% 2015 Notes, we recorded a debt retirement charge of $17 million ($10 million after income tax, or $0.10 per diluted share).  

Q4 2011 Items. Our 2011 results were impacted by the items discussed below, which increased net income attributable to L-3 by $28 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.26 (collectively referred to as the Q4 2011 Items):  

       A tax benefit of $78 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for a net reversal of amounts previously accrued related to tax years for which the statutes of limitations has expired; and  

       Non-cash impairment charges of $57 million ($50 million after income taxes), or $0.48 per diluted share. The impairment charges include: (1) a goodwill impairment charge of $43 million, ($42 million after income taxes, or $0.40 per diluted share), which is included in operating income, and (2) $14 million, ($8 million after income taxes, or $0.08 per diluted share), which is included in interest and other income, net, for our portion of an impairment charge for long-lived assets at an equity method investment. The goodwill impairment charge was due to a decline in the estimated fair value of the Marine Services business, which is part of the Electronic Systems segment, as a result of a decline in its projected future cash flows.

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures  

As discussed above, one aspect of our strategy is to selectively acquire businesses that add new products and technologies, or provide access to select customers, programs and contracts. We intend to continue acquiring select businesses for reasonable valuations that will provide attractive returns to L-3. Our business acquisitions, depending on their contract-type, sales mix or other factors, could reduce L-3s consolidated operating margin while still increasing L-3s operating income, earnings per share, and net cash from operating activities. In addition, we may also dispose of certain businesses if we determine that they no longer fit into L-3s overall business strategy and we are able to receive an attractive price.  

Acquisitions. The table below summarizes the acquisitions that we have completed during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013 referred to herein as business acquisitions. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we used net cash of $62 million primarily for business acquisitions, including an earnout payment and a purchase price adjustment for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2013.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   The purchase price represents the contractual consideration for the acquired business, excluding adjustments for net cash acquired and acquisition transaction costs.  

   (2)   Excludes additional purchase price, not to exceed $10 million, which is contingent upon the post acquisition financial performance of DNI through December 31, 2014. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the additional purchase price for this acquisition.  

   (3)   Excludes additional purchase price of $6 million for a final net working capital adjustment. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the final net working capital adjustment.  

All of our business acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from their dates of acquisition. We regularly evaluate potential business acquisitions.  

Divestitures. On February 22, 2011, we divested the MOI business of Microdyne Corporation (Microdyne), which was within the Electronic Systems segment. This divestiture transaction resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $2 million. Microdynes annual revenues (approximately $8 million), pre-tax income and net assets were not material for any period presented, and, therefore, these divestitures are not reported as discontinued operations.

Spin-off of Engility: On July 17, 2012, we completed the spin-off of our subsidiary, Engility Holdings, Inc. See Spin-off of Engility within this section for further discussion of the spin-off, distribution of proceeds and impact on our financial results and financial position.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and cost of sales during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to contract revenue, profit and loss recognition, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, market values for inventories reported at lower of cost or market, pension and post-retirement benefit obligations, stock-based employee compensation expense, income taxes, including the valuations of deferred tax assets, litigation reserves and environmental obligations, accrued product warranty costs and the recoverability, useful lives and valuation of recorded amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period during which they become known. Actual amounts will differ from these estimates and could differ materially. We believe that our critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and require judgment at the time of the estimate; (2) use of reasonably different assumptions could have changed our estimates, particularly with respect to estimates of contract revenues and costs, and recoverability of assets, and (3) changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  

Contract Revenue Recognition and Contract Estimates. Approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales are generated from contracts (revenue arrangements) that require us to design, develop, manufacture, modify, upgrade, test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment, and to provide related engineering and technical services according to the buyers specifications. These revenue arrangements or contracts are generally fixed-price, cost-plus, or time-and-material type and are covered by accounting standards for construction-type and production-type contracts and federal government contractors. Substantially all of our cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts are with the U.S. Government, primarily the DoD. Certain of our contracts with the U.S. Government are multi-year contracts that are funded annually by the customer, and sales on these multi-year contracts are based on amounts appropriated (funded) by the U.S. Government. Our remaining sales are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers.  

Sales and profits on fixed-price type contracts that are covered by accounting standards for construction-type and production-type contracts and federal government contractors are substantially recognized using percentage-of-completion (POC) methods of accounting. Sales on such contracts represent approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales. Sales and profits on fixed-price production contracts under which units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their contractual selling prices (the units-of-delivery method). Sales and profits on each fixed-price production contract under which units are not produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process, or under which a relatively few number of units are produced, are recorded based on the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion of the contract multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative sales recognized in prior periods (the cost-to-cost method). Under both POC methods of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance, which can exceed one year.  

Accounting for the sales on these fixed-price contracts requires the preparation of estimates of: (1) total contract revenue, (2) total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contracts statement of work, and (3) measurement of progress towards completion. The estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion. Under the units-of-delivery method,  

45  

Table of Contents 

 sales on a fixed-price type contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period based on their contractual selling prices. Under the cost-to-cost method, sales on a fixed-price type contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by (i) the total estimated contract revenue, less (ii) the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units-of-delivery method or cost-to-cost method is equal to (i) the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized, less (ii) the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract. In the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenues, a loss arises, and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that the loss becomes evident. The unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded as a component of other current liabilities entitled Estimated cost in excess of estimated contract value to complete contracts in process in a loss position.  

Adjustments to estimates for a contracts revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained and more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change, or if contract modifications occur. The impact of revisions in profit (loss) estimates for all types of contracts subject to percentage-of-completion accounting are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as reduce the valuations of receivables and inventories, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Aggregate net changes in contract estimates increased operating income by $114 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, $72 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2012, and $73 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011.  

Sales and profits on cost-plus type contracts that are covered by accounting standards for government contractors are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract, at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. Sales on such contracts represent approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales. The estimated profit on a cost-plus contract is fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees are our primary variable fee contractual arrangement. Incentive and award fees on cost-plus type contracts are included as an element of total estimated contract revenues and recorded to sales when a basis exists for the reasonable prediction of performance in relation to established contractual targets and we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates for them. Sales and profits on time-and-material type contracts are recognized on the basis of direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour, plus the actual costs of material and other direct non-labor costs. On a time-and-material type contract, the fixed hourly rates include amounts for the cost of direct labor, indirect contract costs and profit. Cost-plus type or time-and-material type contracts generally contain less estimation risks than fixed-price type contracts.  

Sales on arrangements for (1) fixed-price type contracts that require us to perform services that are not related to production of tangible assets (Fixed-Price Service Contracts), and (2) certain commercial customers are recognized in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers. Sales for our businesses whose customers are primarily commercial business enterprises are substantially generated from single element revenue arrangements. Sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been performed, the selling price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales for Fixed-Price Service Contracts that do not contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual service period, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned, or obligations fulfilled, in a different manner. Sales for Fixed-Price Service Contracts that contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized when the units of work are completed. Sales and profit on cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts within the scope of revenue recognition accounting standards for revenue arrangements with commercial customers are recognized in the same manner as those within the scope of contract accounting standards, except for incentive and award fees. Cost-based incentive fees are recognized when they are realizable in the amount that would be due under the contractual termination provisions as if the contract was terminated. Performance based incentive fees and award fees are recorded as sales when awarded by the customer.

For contracts with multiple deliverables, we apply the separation and allocation guidance under the accounting standard for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, unless all the deliverables are covered by contract accounting standards, in which case we apply the separation and allocation guidance under contract accounting standards. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables should be separated into more than one unit of accounting. We recognize revenue for each unit of accounting based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above.  

Sales and profit in connection with contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government that contain collection risk because the contracts are incrementally funded and subject to the availability of funds appropriated, are deferred until the contract modification is obtained, indicating that adequate funds are available to the contract or task order.  

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. In accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation). Identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. However, we do not recognize separate intangible assets for the assembled workforces of our business acquisitions.  

Generally, the largest separately identifiable intangible asset from the businesses that we acquire is the value of their assembled workforces, which includes the human capital of the management, administrative, marketing and business development, scientific, engineering and technical employees of the acquired businesses. The success of our businesses, including their ability to retain existing business (revenue arrangements) and to successfully compete for and win new business (revenue arrangements), is primarily dependent on the management, marketing and business development, contracting, engineering and technical skills and knowledge of our employees, rather than on productive capital (plant and equipment, and technology and intellectual property). Additionally, for a significant portion of our businesses, our ability to attract and retain employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly those with top-secret and above clearances, is critical to our success, and is often a prerequisite for retaining existing revenue arrangements and pursuing new ones. Generally, patents, trademarks and licenses are not material for our acquired businesses. Furthermore, our U.S. Government contracts (revenue arrangements) generally permit other companies to use our patents in most domestic work performed by such other companies for the U.S. Government. Therefore, because intangible assets for assembled workforces are part of goodwill, the substantial majority of the intangible assets for our acquired business acquisitions are recognized as goodwill. Additionally, the value assigned to goodwill for our business acquisitions also includes the value that we expect to realize from cost reduction measures that we implement for our acquired businesses. Goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the fair value of identifiable acquired assets, both tangible and intangible, less the fair value of liabilities assumed. At December 31, 2013, we had goodwill of $7,796 million and identifiable intangible assets of $285 million.  

The most significant identifiable intangible asset that is separately recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP for our business acquisitions is customer contractual relationships. All of our customer relationships are established through written customer contracts (revenue arrangements). The fair value for customer contractual relationships is determined, as of the date of acquisition, based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the estimated future after-tax earnings and cash flows (including cash flows from working capital) arising from the follow-on sales on contract (revenue arrangement) renewals expected from customer contractual relationships over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales, less a contributory asset charge, all of which is discounted to present value. All identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives as the economic benefits are consumed. We review customer contractual relationships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with the accounting standards for long-lived assets. If any such event or change in circumstances occurs, and, if our revised estimates of future after-tax cash flows are  

47  

Table of Contents 

 significantly lower than our estimates at the date we acquired the customer contractual relationships, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write-down these intangible assets to their realizable values. We also review and update our estimates of the duration of our customer contractual relationships, at least annually. If such estimates indicate that the duration of our customer contractual relationships has decreased compared to the estimates made as of the date we acquired these intangible assets, then we accelerate the amortization period for our customer contractual relationships over their remaining useful economic lives.  

We review goodwill for impairment annually as of November 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The accounting standards for goodwill allow for the assessment of qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and entity relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely or not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. L-3 did not utilize a qualitative assessment approach for the November 30, 2013 goodwill impairment test, as we chose instead to complete the quantitative two-step testing process for each reporting unit.  

A reporting unit is an operating segment, as defined by the segment reporting accounting standards, or a component of an operating segment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by operating segment management. Two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes if the components have similar economic characteristics.  

L-3 had 13 reporting units at December 31, 2013 (and at November 30, 2013 when our annual goodwill impairment assessment was completed) compared to 15 reporting units at December 31, 2012. The reduction in the number of our reporting units was due to a change in L-3s management and reporting structure that resulted in the consolidation of three reporting units into a single reporting unit. The reporting units that were consolidated had fair values in excess of their carrying values at the time of the realignments and the related goodwill for each was included in the current reporting unit.  

As previously discussed, during the quarter ended March 28, 2014, L-3 realigned its business segments. After the realignment, L-3s structure consists of four reportable segments: (1) Aerospace Systems, (2) Electronic Systems, (3) Communication Systems, and (4) National Security Solutions. As a result of the reorganization and related changes to L-3s operating segments, L-3 now has 12 reporting units compared to 13 as of December 31, 2013. Four reporting units were consolidated into two reporting units and one reporting unit was separated into two. The reporting units that were consolidated consisted of the: (1) Communication Systems and Microwave Products reporting units, and (2) Precision Engagement and Training & Simulation reporting units. The Marine Systems International reporting unit was separated from the Marine & Power Systems reporting unit. The following discussion of goodwill and our annual impairment assessment reflects the current reporting structure and number of reporting units.  

L-3s aggregate balance of goodwill increased by $20 million to $7,796 million at December 31, 2013 from $7,776 million at December 31, 2012 due to $44 million for business acquisitions, offset by reductions of $22 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and $2 million for a business disposition. The table below presents the number of reporting units and the associated goodwill at December 31, 2013 for each of our reportable segments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

The first step in the process of testing goodwill for potential impairment is to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If a potential impairment is identified, the second step is to measure the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit. Our methodology for determining the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation approach, and is dependent on estimates for future sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income tax payments, working capital changes, and capital expenditures, as well as expected long-term growth rates for cash flows. All of these factors are affected by economic conditions related to the industries in which we operate (predominantly the U.S. defense industry), as well as, conditions in the U.S. capital markets.  

The more significant assumptions used in our DCF valuations to determine the fair values of our reporting units in connection with the goodwill valuation assessment at November 30, 2013 were: (1) detailed three-year cash flow projections for each of our reporting units, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, and cash flows, (2) the expected long-term cash flow growth rates for each of our reporting units (commonly known as Terminal Growth Rates), which approximate the expected long-term nominal growth rate for the U.S. DoD budget, U.S. economy and the respective industries in which the reporting units operate, expected inflation rates, and specific circumstances for each reporting unit, including contracts or programs ending and expected new business, and (3) risk adjusted discount rates, which represent the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each reporting unit and include the estimated risk-free rate of return that is used to discount future cash flow projections to their present values. There were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2013 as compared to the prior year DCF valuations of our reporting units.  

Each reporting unit WACC was comprised of: (1) an estimated required rate of return on equity, based on publicly traded companies with business and economic risk characteristics comparable to each of L-3s reporting units (Market Participants), including a risk free rate of return of 3.82% on the 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond as of November 29, 2013 (2.81% as of November 30, 2012) and an equity risk premium of 5% (6% as of November 30, 2012) and (2) an after-tax rate of return on Market Participants debt, each weighted by the relative market value percentages of Market Participants equity and debt. The WACC assumptions for each reporting unit are based on a number of market inputs that are outside of our control and are updated annually to reflect changes to such market inputs as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessments, including changes to: (1) the estimated required rate of return on equity based on historical returns on common stock securities of Market Participants and the Standard & Poors 500 Index over the prior two-year period, (2) the risk free rate of return based on the prevailing market yield on the 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond, (3) the rate of return of Market Participants publically traded debt securities, and (4) the relative market value percentages of Market Participants equity and debt.  

The table below presents the weighted average risk adjusted discount rate assumptions in WACC, used in our DCF valuation for each of our reportable segments for our goodwill impairment assessments at November 30, 2013 and 2012.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   Both reporting units within the Aerospace Systems reportable segment used the risk adjusted discount rate in WACC as presented in the table above.  

   (2)   The weighted average risk adjusted discount rate in WACC for the Electronic Systems reportable segment is comprised of separate discount rates for each reporting unit within the segment that range from 7.42% to 8.03% for 2013 and 6.56% to 7.33% for 2012.  

As presented in the table below, L-3s historical three-year average annual cash flow growth rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 for our reportable segments ranged from a negative 4% to a positive 64%. The annual cash flows generated by each of our reporting units varies from year to year, and, therefore, the annual cash flow growth  

49  

Table of Contents 

 rates do not result in linear trends, due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) variability of annual sales volume and sales growth rates, (2) increases and decreases in working capital, including customer advance payments and billings on multi-year contracts (revenue arrangements) with long-term performance periods (exceeding one year), (3) the timing of invoicing and cash collections between fiscal years from receivables due from customers on multi-year contracts (revenue arrangements), (4) the timing of increases and decreases of select inventories procured and produced in anticipation of future product sales, which frequently overlap the ending and beginning of fiscal years, (5) the timing of the receipt of award fee and incentive fee payments from customers on contracts (revenue arrangements), (6) variability in annual cash outlays for research and development costs, (7) changes in cash outlays for capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and (8) increases in annual sales and costs and expense volumes of a reporting unit resulting from business acquisitions. As a result of the factors discussed above and the varying sizes of our reporting units, the annual cash flow levels and growth rates at the reporting unit level tend to fluctuate significantly from year to year.  

The 2013 cash flow amount and the cash flow growth rate for each of the last three years for each of our segments are presented in the following table.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   Reportable segment estimated cash flow excludes interest payments on debt and other corporate cash flows.  

   (2)   The increase in 2013 cash flow for Aerospace Systems was due to small ISR aircraft sales to the DoD and a decrease in tax payments as a result of lower operating income and a lower effective tax rate. The decrease in 2012 cash flow was primarily due to higher working capital requirements, primarily for inventory on new contracts that began in 2012 and an increase in estimated tax payments, partially offset by higher operating income and an increase in advance payments. The increase in 2011 cash flow was due to growth in operating income and an increase in advance payments.  

   (3)   The increase in 2013 cash flows for Electronic Systems was primarily due to a decrease in tax payments as a result of lower operating income and a lower effective tax rate, as well as working capital improvements at Precision Engagement & Training. The decrease in 2012 cash flows was primarily due to lower operating income compared to 2011 for Space & Propulsion Systems, Marine Systems International, and Power & Control Systems. The decrease in 2011 cash flows was primarily due to lower operating income compared to 2010 for Warrior Systems, Precision Engagement & Training, and Space & Propulsion Systems, partially offset by lower working capital requirements at Warrior Systems.  

   (4)   The decrease in 2013 cash flow for Communication Systems was due to lower operating income, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The increase in 2012 cash flow was primarily due to the timing of billings and cash receipts and an increase in advance payments. The increase in 2011 cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements, and timing of billings and cash receipts on fixed-price contracts, partially offset by lower operating income and liquidation of advance payments.  

   (5)   The decrease in 2013 cash flow for NSS was primarily due to lower sales, as well as 2012 cash inflows that did not recur, including collections of billed receivables and customer advance payments. The increase in 2012 cash flow was primarily due to the timing of billings and cash receipt and an increase in advance payments. The increase in 2011 cash flow was primarily due to working capital reductions due to lower sales volume and a decrease in tax payments.  

We consistently consider several factors to determine expected future annual cash flows for our reporting units, including, historical multi-year average cash flow trends by reporting unit and the expected future cash flow growth rates for each of our reporting units primarily based on our estimates of future sales, operating income, and working capital changes. Furthermore, the substantial majority of our reporting units are primarily dependent upon the DoD budget and spending. Sales from DoD customers generate a significant portion of our annual sales and have historically represented approximately 70% or more of our total sales. Accordingly, to determine expected future annual cash flows for our reporting units we also consider: (1) the DoD budget and spending priorities, (2) expansion into new markets, (3) changing conditions in existing markets for our products, systems, and services, (4) possible termination of certain government contracts, (5) expected success in new  

50  

Table of Contents 

 business competitions and re-competitions on existing business, and (6) anticipated operating margins and working capital requirements, which vary significantly depending on the stage of completion (early, mature, ending) of contracts (revenue arrangements). We closely monitor changes in these factors and their impact on the expected cash flow of our reporting units. In addition to these factors that were relevant and specific to each of our reporting units, our goodwill impairment assessments as of November 30, 2013 assumed a declining DoD base budget through FY 2014, a flat base budget in both FY 2015 and FY 2016, and 2% nominal growth in the base budget beginning with FY 2017, consistent with our discussion of the business environment.  

Additionally, our actual cash flows may be higher than our projections and the DCF valuation does not reflect actions that we may take to increase the profitability and cash flows of our reporting units, including our four reporting units with fair value cushions of at least 20% in the second table below. Actions we may take include consolidating and streamlining select business operations, creating future synergies with other L-3 businesses, or pursuing incremental targeted growth opportunities. Additionally, the DCF valuations do not assume future business acquisitions or divestitures.  

The table below presents the estimated: (1) 2014 cash flow amount, (2) average annual cash flow growth rates for 2014  2016, and (3) weighted average annual cash flow growth rates after 2016 for each of our reportable segments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   Aerospace Systems projected cash flow is expected decrease by $97 million from $383 million in 2013 to $286 million in 2014. The decrease is mainly due to small ISR aircraft sales to the DoD in 2013 that will not recur in 2014.  

   (2)   Electronic Systems projected cash flow is expected to decrease by $138 million from $410 million in 2013 to $272 million in 2014. The decrease is mainly due to lower sales and operating income and liquidations of advance payments received in 2013 at Marine & Power Systems, and higher capital expenditures and working capital requirements at Precision Engagement & Training.  

   (3)   Communications Systems projected cash flow is expected to increase by $1 million from $153 million in 2013 to $154 million in 2014. The increase is primarily due to higher expected operating income and lower working capital requirements and capital expenditures at Broadband Communication Systems offset by lower sales and operating income at Tactical Satellite Communications Products and COMSEC & Specialty RF Products.  

   (4)   NSS projected cash flow is expected to decrease by $12 million from $83 million in 2013 to $71 million in 2014. The expected decrease is primarily due to 2013 working capital improvements, primarily due to timing of payments to vendors, not expected to recur in 2014. Projected 2014 sales and operating income are also expected to decline as compared to 2013, although at a slower rate, which will also contribute to the decline in 2014 cash flow.  

A decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment, and a related non-cash impairment charge against earnings, if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  

As discussed above, the more significant assumptions used in our DCF valuations for each of our reporting units were detailed three-year undiscounted cash flow projections, risk adjusted discount rates, or WACC, used to discount the cash flow projections to their present value and expected Terminal Growth Rates. The current year (2014-2016) consolidated three-year undiscounted cash flow projections remained substantially the same compared to the prior year (2013-2015), although the changes by each reporting unit ranged from a decline of 78% to an increase of 23%. The risk adjusted discount rate, or WACC, increased by an average of 80 basis points compared to the prior year valuations primarily due to an increase of approximately 100 basis points in the risk free rate of return and higher equity to debt ratio as a result of higher equity values among Market Participants within each peer group. The expected Terminal Growth Rates utilized in the current year valuations were higher than those utilized in the prior year valuations by an average of approximately 100 basis points. The expected Terminal Growth Rates utilized in the prior year valuations  

51  

Table of Contents 

 were approximately 1% compared to approximately 2% utilized in the current year valuations. The increase in the terminal growth rates assumption was based on several factors, including but not limited to: (1) an increase in the expected inflation rate and economic growth rate, (2) an increase in interest rate levels during 2013 from 2012, consistent with the increase in the risk free rate, (3) an improved outlook for DoD budgets with smaller than BCA required sequestration cuts legislated by Congress for FY 2013, FY 2014 and FY 2015, and a return to a nominal annual growth rate of 2% by FY 2017, and (4) multi-year and Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract wins during 2013 that are expected to generate sales growth at select reporting units.  

We evaluated the sensitivity of the DCF fair value estimates for each reporting unit, which were used for our goodwill impairment assessment, by separately assessing the impact on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by: (1) increasing the risk adjusted discount rate (WACC) by 50 basis points, or (2) reducing the Terminal Growth Rate by 50 basis points, compared to those used in our estimated fair value calculations, while holding all other assumptions unchanged. All of our reporting units would have had a fair value in excess of their carrying value, except for the NSS reporting unit under both scenarios. In each of the two scenarios, the fair value of the NSS reporting unit would have been less than its carrying value and step two of the impairment assessment would have been required. In addition, we applied hypothetical decreases to the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units. We determined that a decrease in fair value of at least 20% would be required before any reporting unit, with the exception of four reporting units presented in the table below, would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value. The table below presents the: (1) risk adjusted discount rates, (2) annual cash flow and three-year average growth rate, (3) 2013 cash flow, (4) goodwill balance, and (5) excess fair value percentage and dollar amount, for each of these four reporting units.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Reporting unit cash flow excludes interest payments on debt and other corporate cash flows.  

 (2)   The goodwill balance is as of November 30, 2013, our goodwill impairment testing date.  

 (3)   The excess fair value represents the percentage and dollar amount by which the fair value of a reporting unit must decline before a potential impairment is identified and would require the second step of the goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.  

 (4)   Our DCF valuation for this reporting unit assumed lower projected cash flow of approximately 15% in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower expected sales and operating income, as well as the timing of payments to vendors in 2013. In addition, our DCF valuation assumed that projected cash flow will remain approximately 15% below 2013 levels in 2015 and 2016 due to continued constraints on DoD budgets, particularly for services. Projected cash flows are expected grow 2% starting in 2017.  

 (5)   Our DCF valuation for this reporting unit assumed cash used of $3 million in 2014 compared to cash flows of $5 million in 2013 due to the liquidation of a customer advance in 2014 on a large international contract that was received in 2013. In 2015, cash flows are assumed to increase to $18 million due to increased sales and operating income, as well as lower working capital requirements, primarily for inventory levels. In 2016, cash flows decrease $23 million to cash used of $5 million due to the liquidation of the customer advance on the large international contract received in 2013. Projected cash flows are expected to grow 2% annually beginning in 2017.  

 (6)   Our DCF valuation for this reporting unit assumed higher projected cash flow of approximately 81% in 2014 compared to 2013 due higher sales and operating income and lower working capital requirements, primarily for inventory. In addition, our DCF valuation assumed that projected cash flow in 2015 and 2016 will grow 129% and 164% above 2013 levels (growth of 51% and 74% above 2012 levels), primarily due to increased international sales at higher margins and associated customer advance payments, and higher margins on domestic programs due to improved performance. Projected cash flows are expected to grow 2% starting in 2017.  

 (7)   Our DCF valuation for this reporting unit assumed that cash flows would decrease approximately 61% in 2014 compared to 2013, before increasing in 2015 and 2016. Cash flow levels for 2014, 2015 and 2016 are projected to be at 40%, 102% and 114% of the 2013 cash flow level. Cash flows decline in 2014 primarily due to the liquidation of the customer advances received in 2013, as well as lower sales and operating income. The increase in cash flows in 2015 and 2016, as compared to 2014, is due to increasing sales and operating income as well as the timing of customer advances on new and follow-on contracts with international customers. Projected cash flows are expected to grow 2% annually beginning in 2017.

As discussed previously, in addition to the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill may not be recoverable. As such, listed below are certain circumstances, depending on their outcomes, that may require us to review goodwill for impairment for one or more of the four reporting units in the table above prior to the next annual assessment (November 30, 2014):  

       lower than expected annual sales from our contracts with the DoD, arising from unanticipated changes or reductions to future DoD budgets;  

       the ability of the reporting units to achieve: (1) 2014 projected sales, operating income and cash flow and (2) the win-loss experience on 2014 contract re-competitions and new business pursuits;  

       the ability of NSS to successfully win re-competes and new business, particularly its largest contract in terms of annual sales, which is scheduled for re-competition in the middle of 2014; and  

       the ability of Space & Propulsion Systems to achieve projected award fees over the five year life of the Missile Defense Agency Medium-Range Ballistic Missile target vehicle contract.  

Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations. The obligations for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long-term assumptions, including discount rates and expected mortality for employee benefit liabilities, and rates of return on plan assets, and expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants in the case of pension plans, and expected annual increases in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of postretirement benefit obligations. These long-term assumptions are subject to revision based on changes in interest rates, financial market conditions, expected versus actual returns on plan assets, expected participant mortality and other actuarial assumptions, including future rates of salary increases, benefit formulas and levels, and rates of increase in the costs of benefits. Changes in the assumptions, if significant, could materially affect the amount of annual net periodic benefit costs recognized in our results of operations from one year to the next, the liabilities for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans. Our pension expense for 2014 is expected to decrease by $101 million to $80 million from $181 million in 2013. Our discount rate assumption increased from a weighted average rate of 4.15% in 2012 to 5.03% in 2013. The expected decrease in our 2014 pension expense is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average discount rate and the increase in our actual asset return. See Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Pension Plans for a further discussion of our estimated 2014 pension expense.  

Discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense in any given period. The discount rate assumptions used to determine our pension and postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were based on a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the yield curve is required to have a rating of AA or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and/or Standard & Poors. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curve. For a sensitivity analysis projecting the impact of a change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense, see Part II  Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Pension Plans.  

Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. At December 31, 2013, we had deferred tax assets of $549 million, deferred tax liabilities of $1,015 million and a valuation allowance of $22 million. The deferred tax assets include $24 million for loss carryforwards and $7 million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods. Deferred income taxes are determined separately for each of our tax-paying entities in each tax jurisdiction. The future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and, to a lesser extent, our ability to execute successful tax planning  

53  

Table of Contents 

 strategies. Based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income and tax planning strategies, we believe that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets, except for capital losses and certain U.S. Federal, foreign and state net operating losses. A change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income, or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies, could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our deferred tax assets, and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and, if significant, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period.  

Liabilities for Pending and Threatened Litigation. We are subject to litigation, government investigations, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business or assumed in connection with certain business acquisitions. In accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies, we accrue a charge for a loss contingency when we believe it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is within a range of specified amounts, the most likely amount is accrued, and we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range represents a better estimate. Generally, we record the loss contingency at the amount we expect to pay to resolve the contingency and the amount is generally not discounted to the present value. Amounts recoverable under insurance contracts are recorded as assets when recovery is deemed probable. Contingencies that might result in a gain are not recognized until realizable. Changes to the amount of the estimated loss, or resolution of one or more contingencies could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our litigation matters.  

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets. In addition to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with our business acquisitions, our long-lived assets also include property, plant and equipment, capitalized software development costs for software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, and certain long-term investments. As of December 31, 2013, the consolidated carrying values of our property, plant and equipment were $1,042 million, certain long-term investments were $12 million, and capitalized software development costs were $52 million. As of December 31, 2013, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment represented 7% of total assets and the carrying value of our capitalized software development costs and certain long-term investments each represented less than 1% of total assets. We review the valuation of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value or net realizable value expected to result from the assets use and eventual disposition. We use a variety of factors to assess valuation, depending upon the asset. Long-lived assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized, and other factors depending on the asset, including estimated future sales, profits and related cash flows, estimated product acceptance and product life cycles, changes in technology and customer demand, and the performance of invested companies and joint ventures. Changes in estimates and judgments on any of these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  

Results of Operations  

The following information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements. The following information has been adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Engility and related classification of results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations. Also, our results of operations for the periods presented are affected by our business acquisitions. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our business acquisitions.

Consolidated Results of Operations  

The table below provides selected financial data, excluding discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)  The year ended December 31, 2011 includes: (1) a tax benefit of $78 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for a net reversal of amounts previously accrued related to tax years for which the statutes of limitations has expired, (2) a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $43 million ($42 million after income taxes), or $0.40 per diluted share due to a decline in the estimated fair value of our Marine Services business, and (3) $14 million ($8 million after income taxes), or $0.08 per diluted share for our share of an impairment charge for long-lived assets at an equity method investment. These items are collectively referred to as the Q4 2011 Items.    

      The company believes that the Q4 2011 Items affect the comparability of the results of operations of the 2012 full year to the results of operations for the 2011 full year. The company also believes that disclosing net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the Q4 2011 Items will allow financial statement users to more easily compare the 2012 full year results to the 2011 full year results. Further, the goodwill impairment charge was included in consolidated operating income, but excluded from segment operating income because the charge was excluded by management for purposes of assessing segment operating performance.

2013 Compared with 2012  

Net Sales: For the year ended December 31, 2013, consolidated net sales of $12.6 billion decreased $485 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 as lower sales to the DoD caused by declining budgets, sequestration cuts and the continuing U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan impacted each segment. Acquired businesses, which are all included in the Electronic Systems segment, added $81 million to net sales in the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales to international government and commercial customers increased 10%, or $315 million, to $3,436 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, including $74 million from acquired businesses, compared to $3,121 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Net sales to international and commercial customers, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, increased to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 24% for the year ended December 31, 2012.  

Sales from products decreased by $397 million to $7,189 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $7,586 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Product sales represented 57% and 58% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Sales of products declined for: (1) Broadband Communication Systems primarily due to lower U.S. Army demand for remote video terminals due to the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan, and lower volume due to contracts nearing completion and declining demand caused by sequestration and other DoD budget reductions, (2) Space & Power Systems due to reduced deliveries of power devices for commercial satellite communication systems, (3) Tactical Satellite Communications Products mobile and ground-based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military as programs ended, (4) Precision Engagement & Training primarily due to programs for ordnance products ending, and (5) Sensor Systems due to lower volume primarily for airborne electro-optic infrared (EO/IR) turrets for the U.S. Army Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) contract due to the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan. The decrease in product sales was also due to sales volume declines for Security & Detection Systems. These decreases were partially offset by sales from the recently acquired Link U.K. business and organic sales growth for: (1) Platform Systems due to increased volume for modifications for the U.S. Air Force (USAF) EC-130 aircraft and (2) Warrior Systems due to increased demand for holographic weapon sights for the commercial sporting and recreation markets.  

Sales from services, decreased by $88 million to $5,433 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $5,521 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Service sales represented 43% and 42% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Sales from services decreased due to: (1) lower volume for small ISR aircraft systems due to the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan and (2) lower volume for Logistics Solutions, primarily due to the competitive loss of a task order for U.S. Army contract field team support services in Southwest Asia and reduced fleet management services due to the loss of the Joint Primary Aircraft Training Systems (JPATS) contract for the USAF and (3) lower demand for technical support for a U.S. Government agency and information technology (IT) support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). See the reportable segment results for additional discussion of our segment sales trends.  

Operating income and operating margin: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $1,212 million decreased $96 million, or 7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating margin decreased by 40 basis points to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in operating margin is primarily due to higher production costs and reduced productivity for the Communication Systems segment. Higher pension expense of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes, or $0.08 per diluted share) reduced operating margin by 10 basis points. Additionally, the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included severance charges that reduced operating income. In 2013, the severance charges were $29 million ($18 million after income taxes, or $0.20 per diluted share) compared to $23 million ($14 million after income taxes, or $0.14 per diluted share) for 2012. See the reportable segment results for additional discussion of segment operating margin trends.  

Interest expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 declined by $7 million compared to the year ended December, 31, 2012, due to lower outstanding debt, which reduced interest expense by $21 million, partially offset by $14 million of interest expense that was allocated to discontinued operations in 2012.  

56  

Table of Contents 

Interest and other income: Interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $9 million primarily due to a $5 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2012 for the dissolution of an unconsolidated joint venture and increased interest income accretion related to the net investment in sales-type leases of flight simulator systems.  

Effective income tax rate: The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to 28.0% from 32.1% for the same period last year. The decrease is primarily due to tax benefits in the year ended December 31, 2013 of: (1) $33 million ($0.36 per diluted share) for the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit (R&E Credit) retroactively reinstated in 2013, of which $17 million ($0.19 per diluted share) relates to 2012, and (2) $8 million related to deferred tax benefits.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations: Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 in the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased 1% to $751 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations increased 7% to $8.24 from $7.74.  

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding: Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2013 declined by 7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to repurchases of L-3 common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, partially offset by additional shares issued in connection with various employee stock-based compensation programs and contributions to employee savings plans made in common stock.  

2012 Compared with 2011  

Net Sales: For the year ended December 31, 2012, consolidated net sales of $13.1 billion decreased by $47 million, or 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Higher sales from the Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments were offset by lower sales from the NSS and Electronic Systems segments. Acquired businesses, which are all included in the Electronic Systems segment, added $196 million to net sales in the year ended December 31, 2012. Net sales to international government and commercial customers grew 15% to $3,121 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $2,716 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.  

Sales from products increased by $37 million to $7,586 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $7,549 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, representing 58% and 57% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in product sales was due to sales from the L-3 KEO and Link U.K. business acquisitions and organic sales growth primarily for: (1) Platform Systems for new contracts, (2) airborne ISR systems, (3) Tactical Satellite Communications Products, and (4) Space & Power Systems. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines primarily related to Power & Propulsion Systems, Warrior Systems, Broadband Communication Systems, and Marine Systems International.  

Sales from services decreased by $84 million to $5,521 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $5,605 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, representing 42% and 43% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Sales from services decreased primarily due to: (1) less demand from the USSOCOM IT support services due to our previous single-award contract converting to several multiple-award contracts, (2) a decline in IT support services for select non-DoD U.S. Government agencies and (3) lower demand for intelligence support services due to the drawdown of U.S. military forces from Iraq. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales primarily due to sales growth primarily from airborne ISR logistics support and fleet management services, networked communications systems and Sensor Systems. See the reportable segment results for additional discussion of our segment sales trends.  

Segment operating income and operating margin: Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $133 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Segment operating margin decreased by 100 basis points to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 11.0% for the  

57  

Table of Contents 

 year ended December 31, 2011. Higher pension expense of $38 million ($24 million after income tax, or $0.25 per diluted share) reduced segment operating margin by 30 basis points. The remaining decrease in segment operating margin was primarily due to the write-off of unbilled and contract inventory assets in the Aerospace Systems segment, sales mix changes and unfavorable contract performance in the Communication Systems segment, and $9 million of legal fees and inventory write-downs related to security and safety equipment in the NSS segment. See the reportable segment results for additional discussion of segment operating margin trends.  

Interest expense: Interest expense declined by $20 million due to lower interest rates on outstanding fixed rate debt, partially offset by higher interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in 2011.  

Interest and other income: Interest and other income, net, increased by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to a 2011 fourth quarter impairment charge of $14 million for long-lived assets at an equity method investment.  

Debt retirement charge: During 2012, we redeemed $500 million of our 6 3⁄8% 2015 Notes and recorded related debt retirement charges of $13 million. During 2011, we redeemed $650 million of our 5 7⁄8% 2015 Notes and $500 million of our 6 3⁄8% 2015 Notes and recorded related debt retirement charges of $35 million.  

Effective income tax rate: The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased to 32.1% from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Excluding the Q4 2011 Items, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been 31.2%. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the expiration of the R&E Credit on December 31, 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted on January 2, 2013, retroactively reinstated and extended the R&E Credit for all of 2012 and 2013. As a result, the 2012 impact was recorded in the 2013 first quarter.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations: Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 in the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 12% to $756 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased to $7.74 from $8.10. Excluding the Q4 2011 Items, net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 decreased 9% and diluted EPS decreased 1%.  

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding: Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2012 declined by 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to repurchases of L-3 common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors, partially offset by additional shares issued in connection with various employee stock-based compensation programs and contributions to employee savings plans made in common stock.

Aerospace Systems  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2013 Compared with 2012  

Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by $44 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Sales declines of $66 million for Logistics Solutions and $10 million for Platform Systems were partially offset by a sales increase of $32 million for ISR Systems. The decrease in sales for Logistics Solutions was primarily due to the competitive loss of a task order for U.S. Army contract field team support services in Southwest Asia, which was completed in 2012, reduced fleet management services due to the loss of the JPATS contract for the USAF and lower volume for field maintenance and sustainment services for U.S. Army C-12 aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by increased volume for field maintenance and sustainment services for USAF training aircraft. Platform Systems sales decreased  

59  

Table of Contents 

 primarily due to lower volume for U.S. Navy maritime patrol aircraft and Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA), as well as reduced deliveries of aircraft cabin assemblies, partially offset by higher volume on USAF EC-130 and international head of state aircraft, and aircraft maintenance for the Canadian Department of National Defence. The increase in sales for ISR Systems was primarily due to $78 million of higher volume on ISR platforms for foreign military customers and $50 million of small ISR aircraft sales to the DoD. These increases were partially offset by $96 million of lower volume primarily for small ISR aircraft systems due to the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $426 million, which included severance charges of $2 million, decreased by $11 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating margin decreased by 10 basis points to 9.4%. Operating margin decreased by 60 basis points primarily due to write-offs of unbilled receivables and contract inventory assets related primarily to cost overruns on the U.S. Army C-12 contract and design and test expenses for aerostructures on a new commercial aircraft, which were identified as part of the Aerospace Systems internal review. Higher pension expense of $12 million reduced operating margin by 30 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by 80 basis points primarily due to improved productivity on certain contracts.  

2012 Compared with 2011  

Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $163 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales increases of $136 million for Platform Systems and $121 million for ISR Systems were partially offset by a decrease of $94 million for Logistics Solutions. The Platform Systems increase was due primarily to volume on new contracts, including the Australia C-27J and international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts and increased scope on the USAF EC-130 aircraft. These increases were partially offset by lower JCA volume for the USAF. The increase in sales for ISR Systems was primarily due to higher demand for airborne ISR systems for U.S. government and international military customers. Logistics Solutions decreased due primarily to the loss of a task order for U.S. Army contract field team support services in Southwest Asia, partially offset by increased demand for field maintenance and sustainment services on a U.S. Army rotary wing aircraft contract that was competitively won in September 2011 and for U.S. Army C-12 aircraft, which began in December 2010.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $14 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 9.5%. Operating margin decreased by 60 basis points due to higher pension expense of $27 million and 50 basis points due to the write-off of unbilled receivables, contract inventory assets and the correction of certain accruals, which primarily related to cost overruns on the U.S. Army C-12 contract and were identified as part of the Aerospace Systems internal review. These decreases were partially offset by 40 basis points primarily due to unfavorable contract performance in 2011 for JCA.  

Electronic Systems  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2013 Compared with 2012  

Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by $29 million, or 0.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Sales declines of: (1) $39 million for Sensor Systems due to lower volume primarily for airborne EO/IR turrets for the U.S. Army PTDS contract due to the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan, (2) $38 million for Precision Engagement & Training primarily due to contracts for ordnance products nearing completion, partially offset by an increase in sales for upgrades for F/A-18 flight

 simulator trainers and volume on new commercial aircraft simulation contracts, (3) $35 million for Security & Detection Systems due to lower orders from the Transportation Security Administration caused by U.S. Government sequestration cuts and the completion of certain international contracts, and (4) $23 million for Power & Propulsion Systems due to certain funding constraints for the Missile Defense Agencys air-launched target programs. These decreases were partially offset by a sales increase of $25 million primarily for Warrior Systems due to increased demand for holographic weapon sights for the commercial sporting and recreation markets. Sales also increased by $81 million primarily due to the Link U.K. and L-3 KEO acquisitions.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $533 million, which included severance charges of $16 million, decreased by $36 million, or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 11.6%. Sales declines and mix changes reduced operating margin by 70 basis points, sales from acquired businesses reduced operating margin by 20 basis points and higher severance charges reduced operating margin by 10 basis points. These declines were partially offset by improved contract performance across several business areas, primarily Power & Propulsion Systems, which increased operating margin by 30 basis points.  

2012 Compared with 2011  

Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $46 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales declined: (1) $82 million for Warrior Systems due to reduced U.S. Army requirements for night vision and illumination products, (2) $61 million for Power & Propulsion Systems due to reduced shipments of tactical quiet generators for the U.S. Army, which reduced sales by $92 million, partially offset by an increase of $31 million primarily due to the landing craft air cushion vehicle service life extension program, and (3) $60 million for Marine Systems International due to negative foreign currency translation of $41 million and lower demand for commercial shipbuilding products. These decreases were partially offset by: (1) $125 million for Sensor Systems primarily for the L-3 KEO acquisition, and (2) $32 million for Precision Engagement & Training of which $49 million was from the Link U.K. acquisition and $23 million was primarily due to increased deliveries of U.S. Army rotary wing training systems for the Flight School XXI program, partially offset by lower volume for guidance products of $40 million due to completed contracts.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $55 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating margin decreased by 110 basis points to 12.3%. Operating margin declined by 100 basis points primarily due to lower sales for Marine Systems International and Power & Propulsion Systems and 10 basis points due to higher pension expense of $4 million.  

Communication Systems  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2013 Compared with 2012  

Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by $322 million, or 13%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Sales decreased $183 million for Broadband Communication Systems, $77 million for Space & Power Systems and $62 million primarily for Tactical Satellite Communications Products. The decrease in sales for Broadband Communication Systems was due to: (1) lower U.S. Army demand for remote video terminals due to the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan, (2) lower volume primarily for airborne and ground-based systems and vehicle mounted satellite communication ground stations due to contracts nearing completion and declining demand caused by sequestration and other DoD budget reductions, and (3) lower productivity due to the implementation of new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems during the 2013 third quarter, which caused sales volume to decline by $45 million. The decrease  

61  

Table of Contents 

 in sales for Space & Power Systems and Tactical Satellite Communications Products was primarily due to reduced deliveries of power devices for commercial satellite communication systems and mobile and ground-based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military as programs ended, respectively.  

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $168 million, which included severance charges of $11 million, decreased by $55 million, or 25%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating margin decreased by 120 basis points to 7.7%. Operating margin declined by: (1) 140 basis points primarily due to higher production costs and unfavorable contract performance for Broadband Communication Systems, (2) 50 basis points for higher costs and lower productivity due to the implementation of new ERP systems at Broadband Communication Systems, and (3) 10 basis points due to higher severance charges of $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by 80 basis points primarily due to improved contract performance for Space & Power Systems.  

2012 Compared with 2011  

Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $61 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales increased $48 million for Tactical Satellite Communications Products and $36 million primarily for Space & Power Systems. These increases were partially offset by a sales decline of $23 million for Broadband Communication Systems. The increase in sales for Tactical Satellite Communications Products was primarily due to higher deliveries of mobile and ground-based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military. Higher deliveries of power devices for commercial satellite communication systems increased sales for Space & Power Systems. The decrease in sales for Broadband Communication Systems was primarily due to lower volume for: (1) the Hawklink contract due to development and low rate initial production work nearing completion and (2) remote video terminals due to lower U.S. Army demand.  

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $42 million, or 16%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating margin decreased by 200 basis points to 8.9%. Operating margin declined by: (1) 90 basis points primarily due to unfavorable contract performance, including higher design and production costs for Broadband Communication Systems, (2) 80 basis points due to sales mix changes, and (3) 30 basis points due to higher pension expense of $7 million.  

National Security Solutions (NSS)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

2013 Compared with 2012  

NSS net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by $90 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to lower demand for a technical support contract for a U.S. Government agency due to U.S. Government sequestration cuts, and less demand for USSOCOM IT support services, as our previous single-award contract converted to several multiple-award contracts, which reduced our workshare.  

NSS operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $85 million increased by $6 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 6.6%. Operating margin increased by: (1) 70 basis points due to legal fees of $5 million related to a supplier dispute and a $4 million inventory write-down of security and safety equipment in 2012, which did not recur in 2013, (2) 50 basis points due to lower operating costs, and (3) 40 basis points for improved contract performance. These increases were partially offset by 70 basis points primarily due to lower sales and mix changes.

2012 Compared with 2011  

NSS net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $225 million, or 14%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Less demand for USSOCOM IT support services, due to our previous single-award contract converting to several multiple-award contracts, which reduced our work share, lowered sales by $82 million. A decline in IT support services for select non-DoD U.S. Government agencies lowered sales by $93 million comprised of: (1) $38 million due to customer IT spending reductions, and (2) $55 million due to contract losses in 2011 and 2012. Sales also declined by $50 million for intelligence support services due to the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq.  

NSS operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by $22 million, or 22%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating margin decreased by 50 basis points to 5.7%. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to legal fees of $5 million related to a supplier dispute, which reduced operating margin by 40 basis points, and a $4 million inventory write-down for security and safety equipment, which reduced operating margin by 30 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by reduced overhead costs, which increased operating margin by 20 basis points.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Anticipated Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  

At December 31, 2013, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $500 million. While no amounts of the cash and cash equivalents are considered restricted, $251 million was held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of cash held in non-U.S. jurisdictions is subject to local capital requirements, as well as income tax considerations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations. We generated $1,263 million of cash from operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2013. Significant cash uses during the year ended December 31, 2013 included $800 million to repurchase shares of our common stock, $209 million for capital expenditures, $199 million for dividends and $62 million for business acquisitions.  

As of December 31, 2013, we had the availability of substantially all of our $1 billion Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, which expires on February 3, 2017. We currently believe that our cash from operating activities together with our cash on hand, and available borrowings under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, defined benefit plan contributions, commitments, contingencies, research and development expenditures, business acquisitions (depending on the size), contingent purchase price payments on previous business acquisitions, program and other discretionary investments, interest payments, income tax payments, L-3 Holdings dividends and share repurchases.  

Our business may not continue to generate cash flow at current levels and, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce dividend payments, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We may not be able complete these initiatives on a timely basis, on satisfactory terms, or at all. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the U.S. defense industry and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.  

Balance Sheet  

Billed receivables increased by $23 million to $991 million at December 31, 2013 from $968 million at December 31, 2012 due to the timing of billings and collections primarily for airborne ISR Systems and Broadband Communication Systems and $5 million from business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to lower sales primarily for Tactical Satellite Communications Products and timing of billings and collections for Platform Systems.  

63  

Table of Contents 

Contracts in process decreased by $79 million to $2,431 million at December 31, 2013 from $2,510 million at December 31, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2013, contracts in process increased $25 million from the transfer of net property, plant and equipment (PP&E) to inventoried contract costs, primarily due to $21 million for a Company owned aircraft that became held for sale. This increase was offset by a decrease of $104 million comprised of:  

       Decreases of $80 million in unbilled contract receivables primarily due to billing and liquidations for deliveries of ISR Systems and Broadband Communication Systems, partially offset by an increase due to sales exceeding billings for Sensor Systems; and  

       decreases of $24 million in inventoried contract costs due to the timing of deliveries across several business areas, primarily Precision Engagement & Training.  

L-3s receivables days sales outstanding (DSO) was 71 at December 31, 2013, compared with 70 at December 31, 2012. We calculate our DSO by dividing: (1) our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables, by (2) our trailing 12 month sales adjusted, on a pro forma basis, to include sales from business acquisitions and exclude sales from business divestitures that we completed as of the end of the period, multiplied by the number of calendar days in the trailing 12 month period (365 days at December 31, 2013 and 366 days at December 31, 2012). Our trailing 12 month pro forma sales were $12,657 million at December 31, 2013 and $13,201 million at December 31, 2012. The increase in our DSO was primarily due to a greater decline in our trailing 12 month sales as compared to the decline in our aggregate billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables.  

The increase in current deferred income tax assets was primarily due to compensation and benefit items from a tax accounting method change elected in a prior year.  

The decrease in other current assets was primarily due to lower short-term receivables for leased training systems. The increase in PP&E was primarily due to capital expenditures, partially offset by depreciation expense.  

Goodwill increased by $20 million to $7,796 million at December 31, 2013 from $7,776 million at December 31, 2012. The table below presents the changes in goodwill by segment.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   The increase in goodwill for the Electronics Systems segment is due to the Mustang business acquisition.  

   (2)   The changes in goodwill from foreign currency translation adjustments are due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and foreign currency exchange rates. The decreases in goodwill presented in the Electronic Systems and Aerospace Systems segments during 2013 were primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British pound.  

The decrease in identifiable intangible assets was primarily due to amortization expense, partially offset by the recognition of customer contractual relationships and technology intangibles for the Mustang business acquisition.  

The increase in other assets was primarily due to higher long-term receivables for leased training systems and capitalized software costs.  

The fluctuation in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of when invoices for purchases from third-party vendors and subcontractors were received and payments were made.  

64  

Table of Contents 

The decrease in advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred was primarily due to the liquidation of balances on contracts for Sensor Systems, ISR Systems, Platform Systems and Broadband Communication Systems and $2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. These decreases were partially offset by the collection of milestone payments for Warrior Systems and performance based billings related to contracts with international customers for Marine & Power Systems.  

The increase in long-term deferred income tax liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in the deferred tax asset for pension liabilities (due to the reduction in the pension plans unfunded status) and the tax amortization of certain goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets during 2013.  

Pension Plans  

L-3 maintains defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 25% of its employees at certain businesses. At December 31, 2013, L-3s projected benefit obligation (PBO), which includes accumulated benefits plus the incremental benefits attributable to projected future salary increases for covered employees, was $2,973 million and exceeded the fair value of L-3s pension plan assets of $2,403 million by $570 million. At December 31, 2012, L-3s PBO was $3,222 million and exceeded the fair value of L-3s pension plan assets of $2,026 million by $1,196 million. The $626 million decrease in our unfunded status was primarily due to: (1) the increase in our weighted average discount rate from 4.15% at December 31, 2012 to 5.03% at December 31, 2013, (2) our 2013 actual pension plan asset return of approximately 20%, which was higher than our weighted average expected long-term rate of return assumption of 8.13%, and (3) 2013 employer pension contributions.  

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption represents the average rate that the Company expects to earn over the long-term on the assets of the Companys benefit plans, including those from dividends, interest income and capital appreciation. The Company utilizes a third-party consultant to assist in the development of the expected long-term return on plan assets, which is based on expectations regarding future long-term rates of return for the plans investment portfolio, with consideration given to the allocation of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. While we also review historical rates of return on our plan assets, the substantial volatility in any one year can result in historical data that is less indicative of future returns. In reviewing our historical returns, we noted that the average annual return on the Companys pension plan assets for the 10 year period of 2004 through 2013, net of investment management fees and administrative costs, was 7.50%. However, excluding 2008 during which global financial markets experienced the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the average annual return was 11.40%, which is higher than the 8.13% weighted average expected long-term rate of return assumption utilized for the year ended December 31, 2013.  

We recorded net actuarial gains of $623 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the increase in our weighted average discount rate as noted above, which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Actuarial gains and losses in a period represent the difference between actual and actuarially assumed experience, primarily due to discount rates and pension plan asset returns. Actuarial gains and losses that our pension plans experience are not recognized in pension expense in the year incurred, but rather are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The accumulated gains and losses in excess of a corridor, defined as the greater of 10% of the fair value of a plans assets and 10% of its projected benefit obligation, are generally amortized to pension expense in future periods over the estimated average remaining service periods of the covered employees. See Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Our pension expense for 2013 was $181 million. We currently expect pension expense for 2014 to decrease $101 million to approximately $80 million primarily due to the increase in our weighted average discount rate as noted above and expected asset returns on higher plan assets following our 2013 actual returns and contributions.  

Our pension expense for 2014 may be different from our current expectations when finalized due to a number of factors, including the effect of any future business acquisitions for which we assume liabilities for pension benefits, changes in headcount at our businesses that sponsor pension plans, actual pension plan contributions and changes (if any) to our pension assumptions for 2014, including the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and salary increases.  

65  

Table of Contents 

Our contributions for 2013 were $105 million and we currently expect to contribute between approximately $97 million and $108 million to our pension plans in 2014. Actual 2014 pension contributions could be affected by changes in the funded status of our pension plans during 2013. A substantial portion of our pension plan contributions for L-3s businesses that are U.S. Government contractors are recoverable as allowable indirect contract costs at amounts generally equal to the annual pension contributions.  

Our projected benefit obligation and annual pension expense are significantly affected by, holding all other assumptions constant, certain actuarial assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a change in certain assumptions for our pension plans and resulting increase (decrease) to the 2014 expected pension expense and PBO at December 31, 2013.

Statement of Cash Flows  

The table below provides a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities  Continuing Operations  

2013 Compared with 2012. We generated $1,263 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $32 million compared with $1,231 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due to $110 million of less cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to lower income tax payments and pension plan contributions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $76 million, primarily for lower non-cash expenses due to deferred income taxes, and lower income from continuing operations of $2 million. Deferred income taxes were lower during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to a decline in pension contributions and the related impact on income taxes. The net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities is further discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources  Balance Sheet.  

2012 Compared with 2011. We generated $1,231 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2012, which was unchanged when compared with $1,231 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating cash flow increased $158 million due to more cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily for collections of billed receivables and advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, partially offset by higher tax payments. This increase was offset by $104 million of lower income from continuing operations and $54 million of lower non-cash expenses primarily for a 2011 non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $43 million that did not recur in 2012. The net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities is further discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources  Balance Sheet.  

Interest Payments. Our cash from operating activities included interest payments on debt of $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and $238 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our interest expense also included amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond discounts, which are non-cash items.

Table of Contents 

Investing Activities  Continuing Operations  

During 2013, we used $261 million of cash primarily to: (1) acquire a business discussed under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and (2) pay $209 million for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $12 million from dispositions of property, plant and equipment.  

During 2012, we used $200 million of cash primarily to: (1) acquire three businesses discussed under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and (2) pay $210 million for capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $335 million of cash received from the spin-off of Engility and $20 million of cash received from the dissolution of an unconsolidated joint venture.  

During 2011, we used $199 million of cash primarily to: (1) acquire two businesses discussed under Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and (2) pay $187 million for capital expenditures.  

Financing Activities  Continuing Operations  

Debt  

At December 31, 2013, total outstanding debt was $3,630 million, comprised of $2,941 million of senior debt and $689 million of CODES, compared to $3,629 million at December 31, 2012, of which $2,940 million was senior debt and $689 million was CODES. At December 31, 2013, we had the availability of substantially all of our $1 billion Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. We also had $634 million of other standby letters of credit at December 31, 2013, that may have been drawn upon in the event that we did not perform on certain of our contractual requirements. There were no borrowings outstanding under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2013, our outstanding debt matures between November 15, 2016 and August 1, 2035. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the components of our debt at December 31, 2013.

Debt Repayments  

In connection with the spin-off, Engility made a cash distribution of $335 million to L-3. L-3 Communications used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $250 million of the 6 3⁄8% 2015 Notes on July 26, 2012. Also, on October 15, 2012, L-3 Communications redeemed the remaining outstanding $250 million of its 6 3⁄8% 2015 Notes. Information on the Senior Subordinated Notes we redeemed during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is presented in the table below. There were no debt repayments during the year ended December 31, 2013.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On February 2, 2011, we repurchased approximately $11 million of our CODES as a result of the exercise by the holders of their contractual right to require us to repurchase their CODES. The CODES are subject to redemption at the option of L-3 Holdings, in whole or in part, at a cash redemption price (plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest and additional interest, if any) equal to 100% of the principal amount of CODES. We may, from time to time, make open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities, including the CODES. Whether or not we repurchase any of our outstanding debt securities, including the CODES, the amount of any such repurchases will vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, the trading price of our debt, other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of our cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, and general economic conditions.  

Debt Covenants and Other Provisions. The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes contain financial and/or other restrictive covenants. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt and related financial covenants, including cross default provisions. We were in compliance with our financial and other restrictive covenants at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  

Under select conditions, including if L-3 Holdings common stock price is more than 120% (currently $108.29) of the then current conversion price (currently $90.24) for a specified period, the conversion feature of the CODES will require L-3 Holdings, upon conversion, to pay the holders of the CODES the principal amount in cash, and if the settlement amount exceeds the principal amount, the excess will be settled in cash or stock or a combination thereof, at our option. See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the CODES, including conditions for conversion. L-3 Holdings closing stock price of February 19, 2014 was $113.67 per share.  

Guarantees. The borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by L-3 Holdings and by substantially all of the material 100% owned domestic subsidiaries of L-3 Communications on an unsecured senior basis. The payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured senior basis, jointly and severally, by L-3 Communications material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of its other indebtedness. The payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest on the CODES is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured senior subordinated basis, jointly and severally, by L-3 Communications and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any of its other liabilities.

Subordination. The guarantees of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Notes rank senior to the guarantees of the CODES and rank pari passu with each other.  

Equity  

During 2013 and 2012, L-3 Holdings Board of Directors authorized the following quarterly cash dividends:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition to the dividends paid as shown in the table above, the Company also paid $2 million and $3 million of previously accrued dividends related to vested employee stock-based awards in 2013 and 2012, respectively. L-3 Holdings repurchased $800 million, or 8.7 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $872 million, or 12.1 million shares, of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2012.  

L-3 Holdings announced, on February 11, 2014, that its Board of Directors had increased L-3 Holdings regular quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.60 per share, payable on March 17, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2014.  

The number of holders of L-3 Holdings common stock, on February 14, 2014, was approximately 27,917. On February 19, 2014, the closing price of L-3 Holdings common stock, as reported by the NYSE, was $113.67 per share.  

Contractual Obligations  

The table below presents our estimated total contractual obligations from our continuing operations at December 31, 2013, including the amounts expected to be paid or settled for each of the periods indicated below.

Table of Contents 

   (1)   Represents principal amount of long-term debt and only includes scheduled principal payments.  

   (2)   The CODES are convertible into cash and shares of L-3 Holdings common stock based on a conversion rate of 11.0813 shares of L-3 Holdings common stock per one thousand dollars in principal amount of the CODES (equivalent to a current conversion price of $90.24 per share). The conversion feature of the CODES may require L-3 Holdings to settle the principal amount with the holders of the CODES if L-3 Holdings common stock price is more than 120% of the then current conversion price (currently $108.29) for a specified period, and if the settlement amount exceeds the principal amount, the excess will be settled in cash or stock or a combination thereof, at our option. Additionally, holders of the CODES may require L-3 Holdings to repurchase the CODES, in whole or in part, on February 1, 2016, February 1, 2021, February 1, 2026 and February 1, 2031 at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the CODES (plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any). See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the CODES, including conditions for conversion and contingent interest features. L-3 Holdings stock price on February 19, 2014 was $113.67.  

   (3)   Represents expected interest payments on L-3s long-term debt balance as of December 31, 2013 using the stated interest rate on our fixed rate debt, assuming that current borrowings remain outstanding to the contractual maturity date.  

   (4)   Non-cancelable operating leases are presented net of estimated sublease rental income.  

   (5)   Includes the residual value guarantee for two real estate lease agreements, expiring on August 31, 2015, that are accounted for as operating leases. We have the right to exercise options under the lease agreements to renew the leases, to purchase both properties for $28 million or sell both properties on behalf of the lessor. If we elect to sell the properties, we must pay the lessor a residual value guarantee of $23 million. See Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases.  

   (6)   Represents open purchase orders at December 31, 2013 for amounts expected to be paid for goods or services that are legally binding.  

   (7)   Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of workers compensation and deferred compensation for the years ending December 31, 2015 and thereafter and also include pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions that we expect to pay in 2014.  

   (8)   Our pension and postretirement benefit plan funding policy is generally to contribute in accordance with cost accounting standards that affect government contractors, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereon. For 2014, we expect to contribute between $97 million and $108 million to our pension plans and approximately $10 million to our postretirement benefit plans. Due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension and postretirement benefit plan funding, we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of one year and we may decide or be required to contribute more than we expect to our pension and postretirement plans.  

   (9)   Excludes all income tax obligations, a portion of which represents unrecognized tax benefits in connection with uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken on our income tax returns as of December 31, 2013 since we cannot determine the time period of future tax consequences. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

The table below presents our estimated total contingent commitments and other guarantees at December 31, 2013, including the amounts expected to be paid or settled for each of the periods indicated below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)   Represents outstanding letters of credit with financial institutions covering performance and financial guarantees per contractual requirements with certain customers. These letters of credit may be drawn upon in the event of L-3s nonperformance.  

   (2)   Represents the minimum guarantees made by L-3 or the lessee under the purchase option for certain operating leases in which the lease renewal is not exercised (see Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of these guarantees).  

   (3)   Represents potential additional contingent purchase payments for business acquisitions that are contingent upon the post-acquisition financial performance or certain other performance conditions of the acquired businesses in accordance with the contractual purchase agreement.  

   (4)   The total amount does not include residual value guarantees for two real estate lease agreements that are accounted for as operating leases. We have the right to exercise options under the lease agreements to purchase both properties for $28 million on or before August 31, 2015. See Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of these leases.

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  

We are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the U.S. Government and, to a lesser degree, under international government contracts, some of which are funded by the U.S. Government. All such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, and, periodically, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations, an indictment by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges. A conviction, or an administrative finding that satisfies the requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term. We are currently cooperating with the U.S. Government on several investigations, none of which we anticipate will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Also, we have been periodically subject to litigation, government investigations, proceedings, claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business. We accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For a description of our legal proceedings and contingencies, see Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

We continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws. While it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost that we will incur to comply with these laws, based upon available internal and external assessments, with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware, we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries, if any, there are no environmental loss contingencies that, in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Derivative Financial Instruments and Other Market Risk  

Included in our derivative financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts. All of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading.  

Interest Rate Risk. Our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility is subject to variable interest and is therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. The interest rates on the Senior Notes and CODES are fixed-rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates. Additional data on our debt obligations and our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we would pay on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, if any, are provided in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. Our U.S. and foreign businesses enter into contracts with customers, subcontractors or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. To protect the functional currency equivalent cash flows associated with certain of these contracts, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are generally designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2013, our foreign currency forward contracts had maturities ranging through 2018, a notional value of $321 million and a corresponding fair value that was an asset of $1 million.  

Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented  

For a discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.  

Inflation  

The effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant. Although a majority of our sales are made under long-term contracts (revenue arrangements), the selling prices of such contracts, established for deliveries in the future, generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods. In addition, some of our contracts provide for price adjustments through cost escalation clauses.

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations, cash flows, financial position, economic performance and financial condition, including in particular, the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.  

All statements other than historical facts, may be forward-looking statements, such as may, will, should, likely, projects, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Companys control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: our dependence on the defense industry; backlog processing and program slips resulting from delayed awards and/or funding from the Department of Defense (DoD) and other major customers; the U.S. Government fiscal situation; changes in DoD budget levels and spending priorities; U.S. Government failure to raise the debt ceiling; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of customers and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding many of our contracts; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts; our ability to successfully compete for and win new business; or, identify, acquire and integrate additional businesses; our ability to maintain and improve our operating margin; the availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements; our ability to continue to recruit, retain and train our employees; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and equity based compensation, as well as the market performance of benefit plan assets; our collective bargaining agreements, our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; global economic uncertainty; the DoDs Better Buying Power and other efficiency initiatives; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our ability to perform contracts on schedule; our international operations; our extensive use of fixed-price type revenue arrangements; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in which our businesses participate; our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; the outcome of litigation matters; results of audits by U.S. Government agencies and of on-going governmental investigations; the impact on our business of improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners; ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations; and the fair values of our assets.  

In addition, for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors and Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements, in each case included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.  

Readers of this document are cautioned that our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.  

As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this filing to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.
