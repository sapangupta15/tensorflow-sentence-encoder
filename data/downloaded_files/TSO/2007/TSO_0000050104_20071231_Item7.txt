ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

 Those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 54 and Risk Factors on page 20 for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.   

 BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OVERVIEW   

 Our strategy is to create a value-added refining and marketing business that has (i) economies of scale, (ii) a competitive cost structure, (iii) effective management information systems that enable success and (iv) outstanding employees focused on achieving operational excellence in a global market in order to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment.  

 Our goals are focused on: (i) operating our facilities in a safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible way; (ii) improving cash flow by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies; and (iii) using excess cash flows from operations in a balanced way to create further shareholder value.  

 During 2007, we achieved the following relative to our goals, which are further described below under Results of Operations and Capital Resources & Liquidity:

 Industry Overview and Outlook  

 The global fundamentals of the refining industry remained strong during 2007. Continued demand growth in developing areas such as India and China and global political concerns supported high prices for crude oil and refined products. In the U.S., refining margins remained above historical levels during the first half of 2007 in part due to the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 During the second half of 2007, industry refined product margins on the U.S. West Coast declined substantially as moderately rising product prices lagged rapidly rising crude oil prices. The average cost of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil (presented in the graph below), for example, increased by approximately $11 per barrel during the third quarter and $23 per barrel during the fourth quarter, as compared to the 2007 second quarter. The rapid increase in crude oil prices reflects continued worldwide demand growth, concerns over declining crude oil supplies, the weakening U.S. dollar and investment fund speculation. While crude prices rose sharply, product prices on the U.S. West Coast increased only moderately during the last half of 2007 reflecting lower product demand and rising product inventories. Product demand on the U.S. West Coast was negatively impacted due to the weakening U.S. economy, seasonality and inclement weather in California during December. In addition to weakening product demand, the increase in product inventories was also a result of strong refinery utilization during the fourth quarter.  

 The following three factors should have a positive impact on industry refining margins beginning late in the first quarter of 2008: (i) lower planned industry production runs combined with the impact of planned turnarounds, (ii) the seasonal reductions of gasoline inventories due to the transition into summer-grade gasoline and (iii) increased seasonal demand. While we continue to be concerned about demand growth and the potential for a U.S. recession, we believe U.S. West Coast industry refining margins should return to their five-year historical averages for the remainder of 2008.  

 Acquisitions  

 Los Angeles Assets  

 On May 10, 2007 we acquired a 100 thousand barrels per day (Mbpd) refinery and a 42 Mbpd refined products terminal located south of Los Angeles, California along with a network of 276 Shell® branded retail stations (128 are company-operated) located throughout Southern California (collectively, the Los Angeles Assets) from Shell Oil Products U.S. (Shell). We will continue to operate the retail stations using the Shell® brand under a long-term agreement. The purchase price for the Los Angeles Assets was $1.82 billion (which includes $257 million for petroleum inventories and direct costs of $16 million). The purchase price of the Los Angeles Assets was paid for with $1.0 billion of debt and the remainder with cash on hand. Borrowings totaling  

 30   
 $500 million under our revolver were repaid in 2007 with cash flows from operating activities. For further information on our financing of the acquisition, see Capital Resources and Liquidity  Capitalization herein.  

 We expect to realize annual recurring synergies of approximately $100 million in connection with our acquisitions through our crude oil purchasing and shipping logistics as well as by maximizing the production of clean fuels for the California market. During 2007, we achieved approximately $45 million of our $100 million synergy goal mainly through shared crude cargo benefits.  

 Based on our most recent estimates, we expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion from 2008 through 2012 for projects to improve reliability, energy efficiency and conversion capability and to upgrade refinery infrastructure to comply with regulatory requirements at the Los Angeles refinery. The projects include an upgrade project designed to increase heavy crude processing capacity, which is under further review and evaluation. The project, if approved, would cost between $200 million to $350 million with estimated completion by the end of 2012. We are also planning to install a new cogeneration facility and boilers to reduce air emissions and improve reliability and efficiency. This project, if approved, would cost approximately $250 million to $325 million with estimated completion in late 2010. These projects continue to be under evaluation. The cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis.  

 Our regulatory projects include replacing underground pipelines with above-ground pipelines as required by an Order from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. This project is estimated to be completed in 2014 and will cost approximately $80 million. Our regulatory projects also include a fuel gas treating unit designed to reduce fuel gas sulfur and new flare gas recovery compressors designed to meet flaring requirements of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. We project to spend approximately $75 million through 2011 to complete the fuel gas treating unit project and approximately $50 million through 2009 to install the flare gas recovery compressors. These cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis.  

 Spending on refinery turnaround and other maintenance at the Los Angeles refinery is expected to be approximately $200 million to $225 million from 2008 through 2012. These cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis.  

 USA Petroleum Retail Stations  

 On May 1, 2007, we acquired 138 retail stations located primarily in California from USA Petroleum (the USA Petroleum Assets). The purchase price of the assets and the USA Gasolinetm brand name was paid in cash totaling $286 million (including inventories of $15 million and direct costs of $3 million).  

 This acquisition, along with the acquired 276 Shell branded retail stations, provides us with retail stations near our Golden Eagle and Los Angeles refineries that will allow us to optimize production, invest in refinery improvements and deliver more clean products into the California market. In addition, greater economies of scale were created as we nearly doubled our retail network by adding 414 retail stations.  

 Strategic Capital Projects  

 To achieve our strategy of a competitive cost structure and earning competitive returns in any margin environment, we focus on capital projects that improve safety and reliability, enhance our crude oil flexibility, improve clean product yields and increase energy efficiency. Our 2008 capital budget is $966 million. All capital expenditures, whether actual or expected, include estimates of capitalized interest and labor. See Capital Resources and Liquidity for additional information related to our budgeted and actual capital spending.  

 Completed Strategic Capital Projects  

 During 2007, we completed the following strategic capital projects:  

       a diesel desulfurizer unit (10,000 bpd) at our Alaska refinery which enables us to manufacture ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and become the sole producer of ULSD in Alaska;   

       the Amorco wharf project at our Golden Eagle refinery which lowers our crude costs as we can now supply all of the refinerys crude oil requirements by water;    

 31   
       two sulfur handling projects at our Washington refinery, which allow us to process a greater percentage of sour crude oils at the refinery; and   

       the control modernization project at our Golden Eagle refinery, which converted our older refinery control technologies to a modern digital system, allowing us to improve refining yields and reduce energy costs.    

 Golden Eagle Coker Modification Project  

 The $575 million coker modification project at our Golden Eagle refinery is currently scheduled to be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2008. The modification of our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker unit will enable us to comply with the terms of an abatement order to lower air emissions while also enhancing the refinerys capabilities in terms of reliability, lengthening turnaround cycles and lowering maintenance costs. By extending the typical coker turnaround cycle from 2.5 years to 5 years, we will effectively increase clean fuels production and significantly reduce the duration and costs of coker turnarounds.  

 Future Strategic Capital Projects  

 During the third quarter of 2008, we expect to complete the selective hydrogenation unit (SHU) at our Washington refinery, which will reduce the sulfur content in gasoline. The SHU will allow a higher percentage of sour crude oils to be processed at the refinery.  

 Beyond 2008, we are currently evaluating several projects that focus on our strategic goals. At our Golden Eagle and Hawaii refineries we are evaluating crude oil flexibility projects that would allow us to process a more diverse slate of less expensive sour crude oils. These projects, if approved, would be completed by the end of 2012. At our Los Angeles refinery, we are also evaluating an upgrade project designed to increase heavy crude processing capacity as described above and projects to increase our capability of receiving waterborne crude oil through access at our Port of Long Beach terminal. We are also studying energy efficiency projects at all of our refineries. These projects are preliminary and are subject to further review and analysis.  

 Hawaii Refinery Initiatives  

 During 2007, gross refining margins at our Hawaii refinery declined by $164 million from 2006. The significant decline in gross refining margins year-over-year reflects the decrease in industry margins and the following factors:  

       Hawaiis reliance on light sweet crude from Asia, which has been pricing at a premium;   

       finished product sales agreements that did not keep pace with rapidly rising crude prices; and   

       unplanned downtime on the refinerys reformer unit and related repairs and maintenance expenses.    

 We have several initiatives to address these issues at Hawaii in 2008. These initiatives include:  

       changes to our crude slate to reduce the amount of Asian light sweet crudes;   

       achieving better value for finished products marketed in Hawaii; and   

       improving reliability primarily through (i) a control modernization project which also improves refining yields and reduces energy costs and (ii) a project to install a new electrical substation to improve electrical reliability, both of which are expected to be completed in 2008.    

 Cash Dividends  

 On January 30, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.10 per share, payable on March 17, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2008. During 2007, we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $0.35 per share.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

 A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented hereafter. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. Our results include the operations of the Los Angeles Assets and USA Petroleum Assets since their acquisition dates in May 2007.  

 Summary  

 Our net earnings for 2007 declined to $566 million ($4.06 per diluted share) from $801 million ($5.73 per diluted share) in 2006 due primarily to the following (these factors and other factors are more fully described in the following discussion and analysis):  

       substantially lower refined product margins on the U.S. West Coast during the second half of the year as crude oil prices rose rapidly and product prices increased only moderately;   

       significantly lower gross refining margins at our Hawaii refinery due, in part, to the factors previously described;   

       higher operating expenses reflecting increased repairs and maintenance expenses and employee costs;   

       the impact of rising crude oil costs on our non-trading derivative positions; and   

       increased selling, general and administrative expenses reflecting higher stock-based compensation and employee costs.    

 Net earnings for 2006 increased to $801 million ($5.73 per diluted share) from $507 million ($3.60 per diluted share) in 2005 primarily due to the following (these factors and other factors are more fully described in the following discussion and analysis):  

       higher refined product margins primarily due to strong product demand combined with extensive industry maintenance and unplanned downtime; and   

       lower interest expense as a result of debt reduction and refinancing in 2005 totaling $191 million.    

 Net earnings for 2006 included an after-tax charge of $17 million related to the termination of a delayed coker project at our Washington refinery. For 2005, net earnings included after-tax charges for debt refinancing and prepayment costs of $58 million and executive termination and retirement costs of $6 million.  

 Refining Segment  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 33   
 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 34   
 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes intersegment sales to our retail segment, at prices which approximate market of $2.8 billion, $987 million and $873 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Intersegment refined product sales volumes totaled 42,700 bpd, 16,200 bpd and 16,900 bpd in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

  (b)    Volumes and margins for 2007 include amounts for the Los Angeles refinery since acquisition on May 10, 2007, averaged over the periods presented. Throughput and yield averaged over the 235 days of operation were 106,000 bpd and 114,000 bpd, respectively.  

  (c)    In 2007, we redefined heavy crude oil as crude oil with an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 24 degrees or less. Previously, heavy crude oils were defined as crude oils with a gravity of 32 degrees or less. Heavy and light throughput volumes for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 have been adjusted to conform to the 2007 presentation.  

  (d)    In 2007, we revised the calculation of gross refining margin per throughput barrel to include the effect of inventory changes. Inventory changes are the result of selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 have been recalculated to conform to the 2007 calculation. Previously, gross refining margin per barrel was calculated based upon manufactured product volumes. Management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations. Manufacturing costs per barrel is calculated by dividing manufacturing costs by total refining throughput and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

  (e)    Consolidated gross refining margin totals gross refining margin for each of our regions adjusted for other costs not directly attributable to a specific region. Other costs resulted in a decrease of $21 million for the year ended    

 35   
     December 31, 2007 and an increase of $1 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput times gross refining margin per barrel.  

  (f)    Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.37, $1.06 and $0.75 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

  (g)    Sources of total refined product sales included refined products manufactured at the refineries and refined products purchased from third parties. Total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products. Total refined product sales were reduced by 66 Mbpd and 23 Mbpd during 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of recording certain purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis upon adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty effective January 1, 2006 (see our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information).  

  (h)    We experienced reduced throughput during scheduled turnarounds for the following refineries: the Los Angeles, Golden Eagle, and Utah refineries during 2007; the Golden Eagle, Washington and Alaska refineries during 2006; and the Golden Eagle, Washington and Hawaii refineries during 2005.   

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Overview. The decrease in operating income of $288 million during 2007 was primarily due to reduced gross refining margins per barrel and increased operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by increased throughput. During 2007, total gross refining margin per barrel decreased by 7% from 2006, reflecting significantly lower industry margins on the U.S. West Coast during the last six months of 2007. U.S. refined product margins during the first six months of 2007 remained well above historical levels primarily due to strong product demand, lower industry refinery utilization due to heavy turnaround activity and unplanned outages, low product inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non-road diesel beginning June 1, 2007. However, during the second half of 2007 industry refined product margins on the U.S. West Coast fell substantially as moderately rising product prices lagged rapidly rising crude oil prices as described above in Industry Overview. Industry margins on the U.S. West Coast in the second half of 2006 were much stronger compared to the second half of 2007 reflecting stronger product demand, lower average product inventories and the introduction of new sulfur requirements for gasoline and diesel. In addition, during the 2006 fourth quarter we experienced record industry margins due to extensive industry turnaround activity and unplanned downtime on the U.S. West Coast.  

 Gross Refining Margins. On an aggregate basis, our total gross refining margins increased to $2.8 billion in 2007 from $2.6 billion in 2006, reflecting increased refining throughput as a result of acquiring the Los Angeles refinery partly offset by lower per barrel gross refining margins particularly at our Hawaii refinery. Discussion of our results by refining region is presented below.  

       During 2007, gross refining margins in our California and Pacific Northwest regions declined 15% and 3%, respectively. The sharp decline in U.S. West Coast industry margins during the second half of 2007, compared to the same period in 2006 when industry refining margins in the region were robust, resulted in a decline in our gross refining margins during 2007. Other factors that negatively impacted our gross refining margins in the California region during 2007 included: (i) the scheduled refinery maintenance turnarounds at our Golden Eagle refinery of the fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) and hydrocracking units and subsequent extension of the FCC turnaround during the first quarter due to unanticipated repairs and equipment malfunctions; (ii) unscheduled downtime at our Golden Eagle refinery during the third quarter which increased feedstock costs and reduced throughput; and (iii) contractual purchase commitments and certain refinery logistical limitations at our Los Angeles refinery which limited our ability to capture the cost differentials between foreign sourced and local crudes. We have identified opportunities to improve our optimization of foreign sourced crude purchases at our Los Angeles refinery and we expect to realize these opportunities beginning in 2008. The Pacific Northwest region was negatively impacted by unscheduled maintenance of the boiler unit for the FCC and scheduled maintenance on two hydrotreating units at our    

 36   
      Washington refinery during the third quarter resulting in reduced operating income of approximately $12 million.    

       In our Mid-Pacific region, gross refining margins declined 82% during 2007, reflecting the decline in U.S. West Coast industry margins during the second half of 2007. Crude oil costs in the region were impacted as Asian sweet crude oils realized higher premiums due to strong Asian demand. At the same time, several of our term product contracts have lagging pricing provisions, which prevented us from fully passing along the rising crude oil costs. In addition, an unplanned outage of the Hawaii refinerys reformer unit during the fourth quarter negatively impacted results by an estimated $30 million, including $10 million of higher repairs and maintenance expenses.   

       In our Mid-Continent region, gross refining margins increased 21% per barrel during 2007 reflecting strong product demand from the farming sector and unplanned refinery outages at several refineries during the first half of 2007. We were also able to take advantage of more discounted local light sweet crudes during the 2007 fourth quarter.    

 Our gross refining margins were also impacted by our non-trading derivative positions during 2007. Our derivative positions were negatively impacted by rapidly rising crude oil costs, which reduced our gross refining margins by $104 million year-over-year. During 2007 and 2006, our derivative positions resulted in a $61 million loss and a $43 million gain, respectively. For additional information relating to our non-trading derivative program see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included herein.  

 Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput averaged 595 Mbpd in 2007 compared to 529 Mbpd during 2006, primarily reflecting average refining throughput at our Los Angeles refinery of 68 Mbpd (see footnote (b) of the table above for information related to refining throughput at our Los Angeles refinery). Excluding the Los Angeles refinery, we continued to achieve near record throughput levels reflecting on-going reliability and operating efficiencies. Scheduled downtime during 2007 and 2006 that negatively impacted refining throughput is described in footnote (h) of the table above. We also experienced unscheduled downtime in 2007 at our Golden Eagle, Washington and Hawaii refineries as described above. During 2006, we experienced unscheduled downtime at our Alaska refinery as a result of the grounding of our time-chartered vessel which impacted the supply of feedstocks to the refinery.  

 Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased 21% during 2007 primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes. Our average refined product sales price increased 10% to $89.47 per barrel reflecting the increase in crude oil prices. Total refined product sales volumes increased 57 Mbpd in 2007, primarily reflecting additional sales volumes from our Los Angeles refinery.  

 Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased 13% to $78.14 per barrel during 2007, reflecting the significant increase in crude oil prices during the year. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to $1.2 billion in 2007, compared with $867 million in 2006, with $196 million of the increase incurred by the Los Angeles refinery. The remaining increase of $144 million reflects higher repairs and maintenance expenses of $52 million, increased employee costs of $42 million, higher marine charter expenses of $22 million and increased utilities costs of $18 million. Depreciation and amortization increased to $314 million in 2007, compared to $221 million in 2006, reflecting depreciation and amortization of $48 million associated with the Los Angeles refinery and increased depreciation from our recent investments in capital projects. Loss on asset disposals and impairments decreased by $31 million primarily due to charges of $28 million during 2006 relating to the termination of a delayed coker project at our Washington refinery. We anticipate our operating expenses during 2008 at our Los Angeles refinery will be consistent with the 2007 fourth quarter primarily due to continued elevated repair and maintenance costs to address aging assets and front-end engineering costs for our capital projects that are not capitalized. However, over the next five years we expect to decrease our operating expenses at the refinery by an estimated 25% as inflationary cost increases are more than offset by lower energy and repair and maintenance costs. We expect to reduce energy costs (assuming energy prices are comparable to 2007) as a result of planned capital projects including a new cogeneration facility and boilers as discussed above in Business Strategy and Overview. We also estimate that repair and maintenance costs beyond 2008 will be lower as a result of implementing new maintenance efficiency and reliability programs along with benefits from our planned capital projects.  

 37   
 2006 Compared to 2005  

 Overview. The increase in operating income of $282 million was primarily due to increased gross refining margins, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and the increased loss on asset disposals and impairments. Total gross refining margins increased 17% from 2005 reflecting higher industry margins in all of our regions. The higher industry margins in 2006 reflected the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 During the second half of 2005, industry margins were higher than the same period in 2006 due to production and supply disruptions on the U.S. Gulf Coast caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  

 Gross Refining Margins. On an aggregate basis, our total gross refining margins increased to $2.6 billion in 2006 from $2.2 billion in 2005, reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions, particularly in our Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest regions.  

       In our Mid-Continent region, gross refining margins increased 40% during 2006, reflecting lower feedstock costs due to higher local crude production and strong diesel demand. During 2005, margins in our Mid-Continent region were negatively impacted by certain factors primarily during the first quarter, including higher crude oil costs due to Canadian production constraints and a depressed market in the Salt Lake City area due to record high first quarter production in PADD IV.   

       In our Pacific Northwest region, gross refining margins increased 19% year-over-year despite a scheduled turnaround at our Washington refinery during the fourth quarter. Margins were positively impacted by continued strong demand on the U.S. West Coast along with higher than normal industry maintenance and unscheduled refining industry downtime. By comparison, certain factors negatively impacted our gross refining margins in 2005. During the 2005 first quarter, margins in our Pacific Northwest region were negatively impacted as our Washington refinery completed a scheduled turnaround of the crude and naphtha reforming units and incurred unscheduled downtime of certain processing equipment. In addition, our gross refining margins in the region during the first half of 2005 were negatively impacted as the increased differential between light and heavy crude oil depressed the margins for heavy fuel oils.    

 Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput averaged 529 Mbpd in 2006 compared to 530 Mbpd during 2005. During 2006, we continued to achieve near record throughput levels reflecting on-going reliability and operating efficiencies due to recent scheduled turnarounds. In addition, our on-going process controls modernization programs at our Golden Eagle and Washington refineries contributed to higher throughput during the second half of 2006. Scheduled downtime during 2006 and 2005 that negatively impacted refining throughput is described in footnote (h) of the table above. During 2006, we experienced unscheduled downtime at our Alaska refinery as a result of the grounding of our time-chartered vessel which impacted the supply of feedstocks to the refinery. During 2005, we had unscheduled downtime at our Golden Eagle and Washington refineries.  

 Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased 11% to $17.3 billion in 2006 from $15.6 billion in 2005, primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices, partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes. Our average refined product prices increased 16% to $81.26 per barrel reflecting the continued strength in product demand. Total refined product sales averaged 586 Mbpd in 2006, a  

 38   
 decrease of 23 Mbpd from 2005, reflecting recording certain purchases and sales transactions on a net basis as described in footnote (g) of the table above.  

 Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased 15% to $69.42 per barrel during 2006, reflecting significantly higher average feedstock prices. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to $867 million in 2006, compared with $855 million in 2005, primarily due to increased employee costs of $23 million, higher repairs and maintenance of $11 million and increased catalyst and chemical costs of $8 million. The increase was partially offset by reclassifying certain pipeline and terminal costs of $37 million in 2006 from other operating costs to costs of sales. Depreciation and amortization increased to $221 million in 2006, compared to $160 million in 2005 due in part to additional depreciation of $50 million due to shortening the estimated lives and recording asset retirement obligations of certain assets at our Golden Eagle refinery beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization also reflects increasing capital expenditures. Loss on asset disposals and impairments increased to $41 million in 2006 from $10 million in 2005, primarily due to pretax charges of $28 million related to the termination of a delayed coker project at our Washington refinery.  

 Retail Segment  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Merchandise and other includes other revenues of $16 million in 2007 and $3 million in both 2006 and 2005.  

  (b)    Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry. Fuel margin per gallon is calculated by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare    

 39   
     companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income and revenues or any other financial measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

  (c)    Includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our refining segment at prices which approximate market. See footnote (a) on page 35.   

 2007 Compared to 2006  The operating loss for our retail segment was $8 million during 2007, compared to an operating loss of $21 million in 2006. Total gross margins increased by $120 million to $233 million reflecting significantly increased fuel and merchandise volumes due to the increase in retail stations, partially offset by slightly lower fuel margins. Total gallons sold increased 664 million, reflecting the increase in the average retail station count during 2007. The 414 Shell® and USA Gasolinetm sites acquired in May 2007 contributed gross margins of $118 million and fuel sales of 643 million gallons. The remaining increase in gross margins of $2 million and fuel sales of 21 million gallons reflects an increase in our Tesoro-branded jobber/dealer retail stations. Fuel margin decreased to $0.15 per gallon in 2007 as retail prices lagged rising wholesale prices.  

 Revenues on fuel sales increased to $2.9 billion in 2007 from $1.1 billion in 2006, reflecting increased sales volumes and higher sales prices. Revenues on fuel sales from our acquired Shell® and USA Gasolinetm branded stations totaled $1.8 billion during 2007. Costs of sales increased in 2007 due to increased sales volumes and higher average prices for purchased fuel. Operating expenses increased $95 million during 2007, of which $84 million represents operating expenses incurred by our acquired stations.  

 2006 Compared to 2005  The operating loss for our retail segment was $21 million during 2006, compared to an operating loss of $31 million in 2005. Total gross margins increased to $113 million during 2006 from $110 million during 2005 reflecting slightly higher fuel margins, partly offset by lower sales volumes. Total gallons sold decreased to 434 million from 449 million, reflecting the decrease in average retail station count to 465 in 2006 from 494 in 2005. The decrease in average retail station count reflects the rationalization of our retail assets, including the sale of 13 company-operated retail stations in August 2006.  

 Revenues on fuel sales increased to $1.1 billion in 2006 from $944 million in 2005, reflecting higher sales prices, partly offset by lower sales volumes. Costs of sales increased in 2006 due to higher average prices of purchased fuel, partly offset by lower sales volumes.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses of $263 million in 2007 increased from $176 million in 2006. The increase during 2007 was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation costs of $31 million, higher employee expenses of $31 million reflecting increases in total employee head count, increased contract labor expenses of $12 million primarily associated with software implementation, and integration expenses related to our acquisitions totaling $11 million.  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses of $176 million in 2006 decreased from $179 million in 2005. The decrease during 2006 was primarily due to higher employee expenses of $15 million in 2006, offset by lower contract labor expenses of $8 million in 2006 and charges in 2005 totaling $11 million for the termination and retirement of certain executive officers.  

 Interest and Financing Costs  

 Interest and financing costs were $95 million in 2007 compared to $77 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the additional debt we incurred during the 2007 second quarter in connection with our acquisition of the Los Angeles Assets. See Capital Resources and Liquidity for information on our borrowings associated with our acquisitions in 2007.  

 Interest and financing costs were $77 million in 2006 compared to $211 million in 2005. During 2005, we incurred debt refinancing and prepayment costs totaling $92 million associated with the refinancing of our 8% senior secured notes and 95/8% senior subordinated notes, and charges of $3 million in connection with voluntary debt prepayments. Excluding these refinancing and prepayment costs, interest and financing costs decreased by  

 40   
 $39 million during 2006, primarily due to lower interest expense associated with the refinancing and debt reduction during 2005 totaling $191 million.  

 Interest Income and Other  

 Interest income and other decreased to $33 million during 2007 from $46 million in 2006 reflecting a significant decrease in our cash investments due to the use of cash to partially fund our acquisitions in May 2007 and make repayments on our revolver. See Capital Resources and Liquidity for additional information on the use of cash to partially fund our acquisitions in 2007.  

 Interest income and other increased to $46 million during 2006 from $15 million in 2005. The increase reflects the significant increase in invested cash balances along with higher interest rates and a $5 million gain associated with the sale of our leased corporate headquarters by a limited partnership in which we were a 50% partner.  

 Income Tax Provision  

 The income tax provision amounted to $339 million in 2007 compared to $485 million in 2006 and $324 million in 2005. The fluctuations reflect changes in earnings before income taxes. The combined federal and state effective income tax rates were approximately 37%, 38% and 39% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate during 2007 was primarily a result of an increase in the federal tax deduction for domestic manufacturing activities. The decrease in our effective income tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily a result of a decrease in our state effective income tax rate.   

 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY   

 Overview  

 We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These risks include, among others, the level of consumer product demand, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 54 and Risk Factors on page 20 for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit agreement and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.  

 Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit. We ended 2007 with $23 million of cash and cash equivalents, $120 million of borrowings under our revolver, and $1.4 billion in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after $254 million in outstanding letters of credit. We also have two separate letter of credit agreements of which we had $126 million available after $204 million in outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2007. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures, working capital and debt service requirements.  

 Acquisitions  

 On May 10, 2007, we acquired the Los Angeles Assets for $1.82 billion (which includes $257 million for petroleum inventories and direct costs of $16 million). To fund the acquisition, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 61/2% senior notes due 2017, borrowed $500 million under our amended and restated credit agreement and paid the remainder with cash on hand. The borrowings totaling $500 million under our revolver were repaid in 2007 with cash flows from operating activities. On May 1, 2007, we paid $286 million in cash (including inventories of $15 million and direct costs of $3 million) for the USA Petroleum Assets, including the USA Gasolinetm brand name. See Note C of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.  

 Cash Settlement with Tosco Corporation  

 On March 2, 2007, we settled our dispute with Tosco Corporation concerning soil and groundwater conditions at the Golden Eagle refinery. We received $58.5 million in cash from ConocoPhillips as successor in interest to Tosco and Phillips Petroleum, both former owners and operators of the refinery. In exchange for the settlement  

 41   
 payment we released and agreed to indemnify ConocoPhillips from both Toscos obligations concerning all environmental conditions at the refinery and Phillips Petroleums liabilities for environmental conditions as a former owner of the refinery. Upon settlement, the $58.5 million settlement was included in our environmental reserves. See Environmental and Other below for further information.  

 Cash Dividends  

 On January 30, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.10 per share, payable on March 17, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2008. During 2007, we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $0.35 per share. In May 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.05 per share (post stock split) to $0.10 per share.  

 Capitalization  

 Our capital structure at December 31, 2007 was comprised of (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 At December 31, 2007, our debt to capitalization ratio was 35%, compared to 29% at year-end 2006, reflecting the additional indebtedness incurred for the acquisition of the Los Angeles Assets and borrowings under our credit agreement.  

 Our credit agreement and senior notes impose various restrictions and covenants as described below that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity capital, pay cash dividends, or repurchase stock. We do not believe that the limitations will restrict our ability to pay cash dividends or repurchase stock under our current programs.  

 Credit Agreement  Revolving Credit Facility  

 On May 11, 2007, we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement to increase the revolvers total available capacity to $1.75 billion from $750 million and borrowed $500 million under the revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of the Los Angeles Assets. The five-year amended credit agreement provides for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the agreements total capacity or the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base ($2.2 billion as of December 31, 2007), consisting of Tesoros eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories, as defined. As of December 31, 2007, we had $120 million in borrowings and $254 million in letters of credit outstanding under the amended credit agreement, resulting in total unused credit availability of $1.4 billion or 80% of the eligible borrowing base. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at either a base rate (7.25% at December 31, 2007) or a Eurodollar rate (4.85% at December 31, 2007) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin at December 31, 2007 was 1.00% in the case of the Eurodollar rate, but varies based upon our credit facility availability and credit ratings. Letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility incur fees at an annual rate tied to the applicable margin described above (1.00% at December 31, 2007). We also incur commitment fees for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an annual rate of 0.25% as of December 31, 2007.  

 42   
 The credit agreement contains covenants and conditions that, among other things, limit our ability to pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments. Tesoro is also required to maintain a certain level of available borrowing capacity and specified levels of tangible net worth. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we satisfied all of the financial covenants under the credit agreement. The credit agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of Tesoros cash and cash equivalents, petroleum inventories and receivables. In February 2008, we amended our credit agreement to allow up to $100 million of restricted payments during any four quarter period subject to credit availability exceeding 20% of the borrowing base.  

 Letter of Credit Agreements  

 We have two separate letter of credit agreements for the purchase of foreign crude oil providing up to $250 million and $80 million in letters of credit. The $250 million letter of credit agreement is secured by the crude oil inventories supported by letters of credit issued under the agreement and will remain in effect until terminated by either party. Letters of credit outstanding under this agreement incur fees at an annual rate of 1.00%. As of December 31, 2007, we had $127 million in letters of credit outstanding under this agreement, resulting in total unused credit availability of $123 million, or 49% of total capacity under this credit agreement.  

 The $80 million letter of credit agreement is secured by the crude oil inventories supported by letters of credit issued under the agreement and will remain in effect until terminated by either party. Letters of credit outstanding under this agreement incur fees at an annual rate of 0.80%. As of December 31, 2007, we had $77 million in letters of credit outstanding under this agreement, resulting in total unused credit availability of $3 million, or 4% of total capacity under this credit agreement.  

 364-Day Term Loan  

 On May 11, 2007, we entered into a $700 million 364-day term loan, which was used to partially fund the acquisition of the Los Angeles Assets. On May 29, 2007, we repaid and terminated this loan, using the net proceeds from the 61/2% senior notes offering and cash on hand.  

 61/2% Senior Notes Due 2017  

 On May 29, 2007, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 61/2% senior notes due June 1, 2017. The proceeds from the notes offering, together with cash on hand, were used to repay borrowings under our 364-day term loan. The notes have a ten-year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are subject to optional redemption by Tesoro beginning June 1, 2012 at premiums of 3.25% through May 31, 2013; 2.17% from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014; 1.08% from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015; and at par thereafter. We have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of 106.5% with proceeds from certain equity issuances through June 1, 2010. The indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature. Substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if either Standard and Poors or Moodys assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture. The terminated covenants will not be restored even if the credit rating assigned to the notes subsequently falls below investment grade. The notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.  

 61/4% Senior Notes Due 2012  

 In November 2005, we issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 61/4% senior notes due November 1, 2012. The notes have a seven-year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are not callable. We have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of 106% with proceeds from certain equity issuances through November 1, 2008. The indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature and are identical to the covenants in the indenture for Tesoros 65/8% senior notes due 2015. Substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if one of two specified ratings agencies assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture. The  

 43   
 terminated covenants will not be restored even if the credit rating assigned to the notes subsequently falls below investment grade. The notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active subsidiaries.  

 65/8% Senior Notes Due 2015  

 In November 2005, we issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 65/8% senior notes due November 1, 2015. The notes have a ten-year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are subject to optional redemption by Tesoro beginning November 1, 2010 at premiums of 3.3% through October 31, 2011, 2.2% from November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012, 1.1% from November 1, 2012 to October 31, 2013, and at par thereafter. We have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of 106% with proceeds from certain equity issuances through November 1, 2008. The indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature and are identical to the covenants in the indenture for Tesoros 61/4% senior notes due 2012. Substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if one of two specified ratings agencies assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture. The terminated covenants will not be restored even if the credit rating assigned to the notes subsequently falls below investment grade. The notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active subsidiaries.  

 The indentures for our senior notes contain covenants and restrictions which are customary for notes of this nature. These covenants and restrictions limit, among other things, our ability to:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The indentures also limit our subsidiaries ability to create restrictions on making certain payments and distributions.  

 95/8% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2012  

 On April 9, 2007, we voluntarily prepaid the remaining $14 million outstanding principal balance of our 95/8% senior subordinated notes at a redemption price of 104.8%. At December 31, 2006, the notes were included in current maturities of debt.  

 Junior Subordinated Notes Due 2012  

 In connection with our acquisition of the Golden Eagle refinery, Tesoro issued to the seller two ten-year junior subordinated notes with face amounts totaling $150 million. The notes consist of: (i) a $100 million junior subordinated note, due July 2012, which was non-interest bearing through May 16, 2007, and carries a 7.5% interest rate thereafter, and (ii) a $50 million junior subordinated note, due July 2012, which incurred interest at 7.47% from May 17, 2003 through May 16, 2007 and 7.5% thereafter. We initially recorded these two notes at a combined present value of approximately $61 million, discounted at rates of 15.625% and 14.375%, respectively. We are amortizing the discount over the term of the notes.  

 44   
 Cash Flow Summary  

 Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Net cash from operating activities during 2007 totaled $1.3 billion, compared to $1.1 billion from operating activities in 2006. This increase was primarily due to favorable working capital changes reflecting an increase in accounts payable due to the acquisitions and higher crude oil costs, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Net cash used in investing activities of $2.8 billion in 2007 was primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities primarily reflects the indebtedness incurred as part of the acquisition of the Los Angeles Assets and borrowings on the revolver, partially offset by dividend payments of $48 million. Gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled $1 billion, and we repaid $940 million of these borrowings during 2007. Working capital totaled $106 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006, primarily due to decreases in cash as a result of partially funding the acquisitions with cash and repayments on our revolver.  

 Net cash from operating activities during 2006 totaled $1.1 billion, compared to $758 million from operating activities in 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher cash earnings and slightly lower working capital requirements. Net cash used in investing activities of $430 million in 2006 was primarily for capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects repurchases of our common stock totaling $151 million (including $148 million under our common stock repurchase program) and dividend payments of $27 million. We did not have any borrowings or repayments under the revolving credit facility during 2006. Working capital totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006 compared to $713 million at December 31, 2005, primarily due to the increase in cash during 2006.  

 Net cash from operating activities during 2005 totaled $758 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $254 million in 2005 was primarily for capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects our voluntary prepayment of senior secured term loans, prepayments of our outstanding 8% senior secured notes and 95/8% senior subordinated notes in connection with the refinancing, and associated debt refinancing and prepayment costs. We also repurchased $15 million of common stock (including $14 million associated with the common stock repurchase program) and paid $14 million of dividends to stockholders. Gross borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit facility each amounted to $463 million during 2005.  

 Capital Expenditures  

 During 2007, our capital expenditures totaled $789 million (including accruals) and included the following major projects: $372 million for the delayed coker modification project (Golden Eagle), $41 million for the removal of atmospheric blowdown towers (Golden Eagle); $19 million for reconfiguring and replacing above-ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping (Golden Eagle); $10 million for control systems modernization (Golden Eagle); $18 million for the wharf expansion project (Golden Eagle); $28 million for a diesel desulfurizer unit (Alaska); and $19 million for sulfur handling projects (Washington). At our Los Angeles refinery we spent $41 million since acquisition during 2007.  

 Our 2008 capital budget is $966 million. Amounts included in the 2008 capital budget are $55 million for a gasoline hydrotreater (Utah), $76 million to complete the delayed coker project (Golden Eagle), $45 million for a flare gas recovery project (Los Angeles), $35 million for design work related to a cogeneration facility and boiler replacement project (Los Angeles), $30 million for design work related to a heavy crude processing upgrade project (Los Angeles) and $15 million for a selective hydrogenation unit (Washington).  

 See Business Strategy and Overview and Environmental Capital Expenditures for additional information.  

 45   
 Refinery Turnaround Spending  

 For refinery turnarounds, we spent $120 million, primarily at our Golden Eagle, Los Angeles and Utah refineries, and an additional $23 million for other maintenance during 2007. In 2008, we expect to spend approximately $113 million for refinery turnarounds, primarily at our Golden Eagle, Los Angeles and Washington refineries, and an additional $22 million for other maintenance. Refining throughput and yields in 2008 will be affected by scheduled turnarounds at our Golden Eagle and Washington refineries during the first quarter and our Los Angeles refinery during the fourth quarter.  

 Long-Term Commitments  

 Contractual Commitments  

 We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes I and M in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)    Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings.  

  (2)    Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations represent our future minimum lease commitments. Operating lease commitments for 2008 include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year.  

  (3)    Represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks, with remaining terms ranging from 6 months to 4 years. Prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate with market-responsive pricing provisions. To estimate our annual commitments under these contracts, we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices as of December 31, 2007, ranging by crude oil type from $71 per barrel to $90 per barrel, and volumes based on the contracts minimum purchase requirements. We also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short-term renewable contracts and in the spot market, which are not included in the table above.  

  (4)    Represents primarily long-term commitments to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contracts minimum volume requirements.  

  (5)    Although we have no minimum required contribution obligation to our pension plan under applicable laws and regulations, we currently project to voluntarily contribute approximately $20 million in 2008. Amounts are subject to change based on the performance of the assets in the plan, the discount rate used to determine the obligation, and other actuarial assumptions. See Critical Accounting Policies for further information related to our pension plan. We are unable to project benefit contributions beyond 2012.   

 In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $44 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we are uncertain as to when such amounts may be settled. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of  

 46   
 $23 million at December 31, 2007. See Note K in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Other than our leasing arrangements described in Note M to our consolidated financial statements, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.  

 Environmental and Other Matters  

 Tesoro is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls, or make other modifications or changes in certain emission sources.  

 Conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites, including, but not limited to, our refineries, tank farms, pipelines, retail stations (operating and closed locations) and refined products terminals, and for compliance with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future expenditures. For further information on environmental matters and other contingencies, see Note M in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.  

 Environmental Liabilities  

 We are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites, including certain of our previously owned properties. Our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties, refining, pipeline and terminal operations and retail stations. We believe these accruals are adequate, based on currently available information, including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions. These estimated environmental liabilities require judgment to assess and estimate the future costs to remediate. It is reasonably possible that additional remediation costs will be incurred as more information becomes available related to these environmental matters. Changes in our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 On March 2, 2007, we settled our dispute with Tosco Corporation (Tosco) concerning soil and groundwater conditions at the Golden Eagle refinery. We received $58.5 million from ConocoPhillips as successor in interest to Tosco and Phillips Petroleum, both former owners and operators of the refinery. In exchange for the settlement proceeds we assumed responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to August of 2000. At December 31, 2007, our accrual for these environmental liabilities totaled $64 million. We expect to have valid insurance claims under certain environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to $140 million for liabilities in excess of the settlement proceeds attributable to Tosco. Amounts recorded for these environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible insurance recoveries.  

 We are continuing to investigate environmental conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Golden Eagle refinery. This investigation is driven by an order from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality  

 47   
 Control Board that names us as well as two previous owners of the Golden Eagle refinery. A reserve for this matter is included in the environmental accruals referenced above.  

 In March 2007, we received an offer from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (the District) to settle 77 Notices of Violation (NOVs) for $4 million. The NOVs allege violations of air quality at our Golden Eagle refinery. In January 2008, we agreed to settle this matter for $1.5 million pending the negotiation of a final agreement with the District. A reserve for this matter is included in the environmental accruals referenced above.  

 In October 2005, we received an NOV from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning our Washington refinery. The EPA alleges certain modifications made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit at our Washington refinery prior to our acquisition of the refinery were made in violation of the Clean Air Act. We have investigated the allegations and believe the ultimate resolution of the NOV will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. A reserve for our response to the NOV is included in the environmental accruals referenced above.  

 Other Environmental Matters  

 We are a defendant, along with other manufacturing, supply and marketing defendants, in ten pending cases alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. In December 2007, we agreed to participate in a proposed settlement of seven and part of an eighth of the pending cases subject to negotiation of settlement documents. The defendants are being sued for having manufactured MTBE and having manufactured, supplied and distributed gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs, all in California, are generally water providers, governmental authorities and private well owners alleging, in part, the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees. A reserve for the cases included in the proposed settlement is included in other accrued liabilities. We believe the final resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, but at this time we cannot estimate the amount or the likelihood of the ultimate resolution of the cases not subject to the settlement. We believe we have defenses to the claims in the remaining cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in those lawsuits.  

 On January 25, 2008 we received an offer of settlement from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) related to the grounding of a vessel in the Alaska Cook Inlet on February 2, 2006. The ADEC has alleged two vessels chartered by us violated provisions of our Cook Inlet Vessel Oil Prevention and Contingency Plan during the period from December 2004 to February 2006. The resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 In the ordinary course of business, we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable, and some matters may require years for us to resolve. As a result, we have not established reserves for these matters. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot provide assurance that an adverse resolution of the matter described below during a future reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in future periods.  

 On December 12, 2007 we received an NOV from ADEC alleging that our Alaska refinery violated provisions of its Clean Air Act Title V operating permit. We are negotiating a resolution of the NOV with ADEC and do not believe the resolution will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 Environmental Capital Expenditures  

 EPA regulations related to the Clean Air Act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline. We are installing a gasoline hydrotreater at our Utah refinery to satisfy the requirements of the regulations. During 2007, we spent $9 million and have budgeted an additional $60 million through 2009 to complete the project. Our other refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the low sulfur gasoline standards.  

 48   
 EPA regulations related to the Clean Air Act also require reductions in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on-road consumption. In general, the new on-road diesel fuel standards became effective on June 1, 2006. In May 2004, the EPA issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non-road diesel fuel. The requirements to reduce non-road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases between 2007 and 2012. In May 2007, we completed the diesel desulfurizer unit at our Alaska refinery, enabling the refinery to manufacture ultra-low sulfur diesel. We spent $28 million on this project in 2007. We are currently evaluating alternative projects that will satisfy the future requirements under existing regulations at our North Dakota, Utah and Hawaii refineries. Our Golden Eagle, Los Angeles, Washington and Alaska refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the new diesel fuel standards.  

 In February 2007, the EPA issued regulations for the reduction of benzene in gasoline. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard; however, based on our most recent estimates we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $400 million between 2008 and 2011 to meet the new regulations at five of our refineries. These cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis. Our Golden Eagle and Los Angeles refineries will not require capital spending to meet the new benzene reduction standards.  

 During the fourth quarter of 2005, we received approval by the Hearing Board for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to modify our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker at our Golden Eagle refinery which is designed to lower emissions while also enhancing the refinerys capabilities in terms of reliability, lengthening turnaround cycles and reducing operating costs. We negotiated the terms and conditions of the Second Conditional Abatement Order with the District in response to the January 2005 mechanical failure of the fluid coker boiler at the Golden Eagle refinery. The total capital for this project is estimated to be $575 million, which includes remaining spending of $76 million in 2008. The project is currently scheduled to be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2008, with spending through the first half of 2008. We have spent $499 million from inception of the project, of which $372 million was spent in 2007.  

 The Los Angeles refinery is subject to extensive environmental requirements. The Los Angeles refinery will reduce NOx emissions by the end of 2010 in response to regulations imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Our current plans for compliance include the replacement of our less efficient power cogeneration units and steam boilers. We expect to spend approximately $250 million to $325 million with estimated completion in late 2010. We also will replace underground pipelines with above-ground pipelines as required by an Order from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. This project is estimated to be completed in 2014 and will cost approximately $80 million. Our regulatory requirements also include a fuel gas treating unit designed to reduce fuel gas sulfur and new flare gas recovery compressors designed to meet flaring requirements of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. We project to spend approximately $75 million through 2011 to complete the fuel gas treating unit project and approximately $50 million through 2009 to install the flare gas recovery compressors. These cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis.  

 We have developed a plan to eliminate the use of any atmospheric blowdown towers by constructing alternative emission control units at our refineries. We believe that this plan will provide for safer operating conditions for our employees and will address environmental regulatory issues related to monitoring potential air emissions from components connected to the blowdown towers. We have spent $41 million during 2007 and we have budgeted an additional $135 million through 2010 to complete this project at two of our refineries.  

 In connection with the 2002 acquisition of our Golden Eagle refinery, we agreed to undertake projects at our Golden Eagle refinery to reduce air emissions required by a Consent Decree with the EPA concerning the Section 114 refinery enforcement initiative under the Clean Air Act. We spent $1 million during 2007 and have budgeted an additional $17 million through 2011 to satisfy the requirements of the Consent Decree.  

 We will spend additional capital at the Golden Eagle refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above-ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery. We spent $19 million during 2007 and we have budgeted an additional $90 million through 2011. We also spent $3 million during 2007 and we expect to spend an additional $65 million through 2010 to upgrade a marine oil wharf at the Golden Eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the State of California in February 2006. This cost estimate is preliminary and subject to further review.

 In connection with our 2001 acquisition of our North Dakota and Utah refineries, Tesoro assumed the sellers obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the United States, BP Exploration and Oil Co. (BP), Amoco Oil Company and Atlantic Richfield Company. BP entered into this consent decree for both the North Dakota and Utah refineries for various alleged violations. As the owner of these refineries, Tesoro is required to address issues to reduce air emissions. We spent $7 million during 2007 and we have budgeted an additional $10 million through 2009 to comply with this consent decree. We also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree.  

 The California Air Resources Board regulations require the installation of enhanced vapor recovery systems at all California gasoline retail stations by April 2009. The enhanced vapor recovery systems control and contain gasoline vapor emissions during motor vehicle fueling. We spent $2 million during 2007 and have budgeted approximately $17 million through 2009 to satisfy the requirements of the enhanced vapor recovery regulations.  

 In December 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which, among other things sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks by model year 2020 and modified the industry requirements for Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The RFS now stands at 9 billion gallons in 2008 rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Both requirements could reduce demand growth for petroleum products in the future. In the near term, the RFS presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for both the ethanol and refining industries and may require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased ethanol use. These requirements are currently under study.  

 In June 2007, the California Resources Air Board proposed amendments to the predictive model for compliant gasoline in the state of California that decreases the allowable sulfur levels to a cap of 20 parts per million and allows for additional ethanol to be blended into gasoline. The requirements begin December 31, 2009 but may be postponed by individual companies until December 31, 2011 through the use of the Alternative Emission Reduction Plan which allows for the acquisition of emissions offsets from sources not directly related to petroleum fuel use. We expect both of our California refineries to be in compliance with the regulation by the 2009 deadline and expect to spend approximately $32 million through 2010 to meet the requirements.  

 Pension Funding  

 For all eligible employees, we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 8.5%, and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a return of $24 million in 2007 and $30 million in 2006. Based on a 6.1% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2007, the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 98% of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of 2007. However, the funded employee pension plan was 111% funded based on its current liability, which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations. Although Tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in 2007, we voluntarily contributed $36 million to improve the funded status of the plan. We currently have no minimum required contribution obligation to our funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in 2008; however, we currently expect to contribute approximately $20 million in 2008. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, employee demographics and other factors. See Note L in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.  

 Claims Against Third-Parties  

 In 1996, Tesoro Alaska Company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). Our protest asserted that the TAPS intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced. The Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years 1997 through 2000. The RCA set just and reasonable final rates for the years 1997 through 2000 in Order 151, and held that we are entitled to receive approximately $52 million in refunds, including interest through the expected conclusion of appeals in 2008. In February 2008, the Alaska Supreme Court, affirmed the RCAs Order 151.  

 50   
 In 2002, the RCA rejected the TAPS Carriers proposed intrastate rate increases for 2001-2003 and maintained the permanent rate of $1.96 to the Valdez Marine Terminal. That ruling is currently on appeal to the Alaska Superior Court. The rate decrease has been in effect since June 2003. The TAPS Carriers subsequently attempted to increase their intrastate rates for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 without providing the supporting information required by the RCAs regulations and in a manner inconsistent with the RCAs prior decision in Order 151. These filings were rejected by the RCA. The rejection of these filings is currently on appeal to the Alaska Superior Court where the decision is being held in abeyance pending the decision in the appeals of the rates for 1997-2003. If the RCAs decisions are upheld on appeal, we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our shipments from January 2001 through mid-June 2003. If the RCAs decisions are not upheld on appeal, we could potentially have to pay the difference between the TAPS Carriers filed rates from mid-June 2003 through December 31, 2007 (averaging approximately $3.87 per barrel) and the RCAs approved rate for this period ($1.96 per barrel) plus interest for the approximately 48 million barrels we have transported through TAPS in intrastate commerce during this period. We cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in these appeals. We also believe that, should we not prevail on appeal, the amount of additional shipping charges cannot reasonably be estimated since it is not possible to estimate the permanent rate which the RCA could set, and the appellate courts approve, for each year. In addition, depending upon the level of such rates, there is a reasonable possibility that any refunds for the period January 2001 through mid-July 2003 could offset some or all of any additional payments due for the period mid-June 2003 through December 31, 2007.  

 In January of 2005, Tesoro Alaska Company intervened in a protest before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), of the TAPS Carriers interstate rates for 2005 and 2006. If Tesoro Alaska Company prevails and lower rates are set, we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our interstate shipments for 2005 and 2006. We cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this proceeding. In July 2005, the TAPS Carriers filed a proceeding at the FERC seeking to have the FERC assume jurisdiction under Section 13(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act and set future rates for intrastate transportation on TAPS. We filed a protest in that proceeding, which has been consolidated with the other FERC proceeding seeking to set just and reasonable interstate rates on TAPS for 2005 and 2006. On May 17, 2007, the presiding judge in this consolidated FERC proceeding lowered the interstate rates and refused to revise the current intrastate rates. The TAPS Carriers have requested that the FERC reverse the presiding judge. We cannot give assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this proceeding. If the TAPS carriers should prevail, then the rates charged for all shipments of Alaska North Slope crude oil on TAPS could be revised by the FERC, but any FERC changes to rates for intrastate transportation of crude oil supplies for our Alaska refinery should be prospective only and should not affect prior intrastate rates, refunds or additional payments.   

 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our accounting policies are described in Note A in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.  

 Receivables  Our trade receivables are stated at their invoiced amounts, less an allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts. We monitor the credit and payment experience of our customers and manage our loss exposure through our credit policies and procedures. The estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our general loss experience and identified loss exposures on individual accounts. Although actual losses have not been significant to our results of operations, global economic conditions and the related credit environment could change, and actual losses could vary from estimates.  

 51   
 Inventory  Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the LIFO method to determine the cost of our crude oil and refined product inventories. The LIFO cost of these inventories is usually much less than current market value, however, a significant decline in market values of crude oil and refined products could impair the carrying values of these inventories. We had 29 million barrels of crude oil and refined product inventories at December 31, 2007 with an average cost of approximately $43 per barrel on a LIFO basis. If refined product prices decline below the average cost, then we would be required to write down the value of our inventories in future periods. The use of LIFO may also result in increases or decreases to costs of sales in years when inventory volumes decline and result in costs of sales associated with inventory layers recorded in prior periods.  

 Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles  We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, global economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. We evaluate these assets for potential impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and, if so, assessing whether the assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss, if any, to be recorded is equal to the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasting the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

 Goodwill  As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had goodwill of $92 million and $89 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. We review the recorded value of our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value, including the related goodwill, of that reporting unit. We use the present value of expected net cash flows and market multiple analyses to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The impairment test is susceptible to change from period to period as it requires us to make cash flow assumptions including, among other things, future margins, volumes, operating costs, capital expenditures and discount rates. Our assumptions regarding future margins and volumes require significant judgment as actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to do so. Changes in market conditions could result in impairment charges in the future.  

 Contingencies  We record an estimated loss from a contingency when information available before issuing our financial statements indicates that (a) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We are required to use our judgment to account for contingencies such as environmental, legal and income tax matters. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, the actual loss may differ from our estimated loss, and we would record the necessary adjustments in future periods. We do not record the benefits of contingent recoveries or gains until the amount is determinable and recovery is assured.  

 Environmental Liabilities - At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our total environmental liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities were $90 million and $23 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a reasonably estimated cost based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties. Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our total accrued environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. Our estimated liabilities are not discounted to present value.  

 52   
 Income Taxes  As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred income tax assets. Based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable, we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2007. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a valuation allowance. Beginning January 1, 2007 with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken that are not recognized under the pronouncement are recorded as liabilities (See New Accounting Standards and Disclosures for additional information).  

 Asset Retirement Obligations  We record asset retirement obligations in the period in which the obligations are incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We use the present value of expected cash flows to estimate fair value. The calculation of fair value is based on several estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, projected cash flows, inflation, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, the settlement dates or a range of potential settlement dates and the probabilities associated with the potential settlement dates. We consider our past practice, industry practice, managements intent and estimated economic lives to estimate settlement dates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our asset retirement obligations totaled $82 million and $52 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We cannot currently make reasonable estimates of the fair values of some retirement obligations, principally those associated with our refineries, pipelines and certain terminals and retail stations, because the related assets have indeterminate useful lives which preclude development of assumptions about the potential timing of settlement dates. Such obligations will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must also assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status and a liability for our plans underfunded status. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value our plans assets and its projected benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the pension plans would have had the following effects in 2007 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 See Note L in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.  

 Stock-Based Compensation  We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and other stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock-  

 53   
 based awards. The estimated fair value of our stock appreciation rights are revalued at the end of each reporting period, and changes in our assumptions may impact our liabilities and expenses associated with these awards.
