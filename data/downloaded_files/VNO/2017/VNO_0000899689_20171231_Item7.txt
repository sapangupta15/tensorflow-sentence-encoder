Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.5% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2017. All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

On July 17, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment comprised of (i) 37 office properties totaling over 11.1 million square feet, five multifamily properties with 3,133 units and five other assets totaling approximately 406,000 square feet and (ii) 18 future development assets totaling over 10.4 million square feet of estimated potential development density, and (iii) $412.5 million of cash ($275.0 million plus The Bartlett financing proceeds less transaction costs and other mortgage items) to JBG SMITH Properties (“JBGS”). On July 18, 2017, JBGS was combined with the management business and certain Washington, DC assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”), a Washington, DC real estate company. Steven Roth, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado, is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of JBGS. Mitchell Schear, former President of our Washington, DC business, is a member of the Board of Trustees of JBGS. We are providing transition services to JBGS initially including information technology, financial reporting and payroll services. The spin-off was effected through a tax-free distribution by Vornado to the holders of Vornado common shares of all of the common shares of JBGS at the rate of one JBGS common share for every two common shares of Vornado and the distribution by the Operating Partnership to the holders of its common units of all of the outstanding common units of JBG SMITH Properties LP (“JBGSLP”) at the rate of one JBGSLP common unit for every two common units of VRLP held of record. See JBGS’ Amendment No. 3 on Form 10 (File No. 1-37994) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2017 for additional information. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the historical financial results of our Washington, DC segment are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

We own and operate office and retail properties with a large concentration in the New York City metropolitan area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, a 32.5% interest in Toys “R” Us, Inc. (“Toys”) as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2017:

Overview - continued

We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and execute our operating strategies through:

•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Acquisitions

In September 2016, our 50.1% joint venture with the Related Companies (“Related”) was designated by Empire State Development (“ESD”), an entity of New York State, to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office building. The building will include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 120,000 square feet of retail space. On June 15, 2017, the joint venture closed a 99-year, triple-net lease with ESD for the commercial space at the Moynihan Office Building and made a $230,000,000 upfront contribution, of which our share is $115,230,000, towards the construction of the train hall. The lease calls for annual rent payments of $5,000,000 plus payments in lieu of real estate taxes. Simultaneously, the joint venture completed a $271,000,000 loan facility, of which $210,269,000 is outstanding at December 31, 2017. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 3.25% (4.64% at December 31, 2017) and matures in June 2019 with two one-year extension options.

The joint venture has also entered into a development agreement with ESD and a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders. Under the development agreement with ESD, the joint venture is obligated to build the Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture’s obligations. Under the design-build agreement, Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders is obligated to fulfill all of the joint venture’s obligations. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bears a full guaranty from Skanska AB. 

Dispositions

On May 26, 2017, Sterling Suffolk Racecourse, LLC ("Suffolk Downs JV"), a joint venture in which we have a 21.2% equity interest, sold the property comprising the Suffolk Downs racetrack in East Boston, Massachusetts (“Suffolk Downs”) for $155,000,000, which resulted in net proceeds and a net gain to us of $15,314,000. In addition, we were repaid $29,318,000 of principal and $6,129,000 of accrued interest on our debt investments in Suffolk Downs JV, resulting in a net gain of $11,373,000.

From the inception of this investment through its disposition, the Fund realized a $35,620,000 net gain.  

During 2017, India Property Fund, in which we had a 36.5% interest, sold its investments. Our share of the aggregate sales price was approximately $23,895,000 which resulted in a financial statement loss of $533,000. In addition, on December 28, 2017, we sold our 25% interest in TCG Urban Infrastructure Holdings Private Limited for $18,742,000 which resulted in a financial statement gain of $1,885,000, which substantially completes the disposition of our investments in India.

Financings

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On October 17, 2017, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from November 2018 to January 2022 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from LIBOR plus 1.05% to LIBOR plus 1.00%. The interest rate and facility fees are the same as our other $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in February 2021 with two six-month extension options. 

Senior Unsecured Notes

On December 27, 2017, we completed a public offering of $450,000,000 3.50% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2025.

Preferred Securities

In December 2017, we sold 12,780,000 5.25% Series M cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Upon the acquisition of real estate that meets the criteria of a business under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments which are on a relative fair value basis. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We record acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired intangible liabilities (including below–market leases) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $11.9 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $159,260,000 and $189,668,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $205,600,000 and $252,216,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and whether we are the primary beneficiary. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the entity is not considered a VIE and the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to decisions that most significantly impact the performance of the partially owned entity. This includes decisions regarding operating/capital budgets, and the placement of new or additional financing secured by the assets of the venture, among others. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. 

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities were $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($5,526,000 and $6,708,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents ($954,000 and $1,913,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively). These receivables arise from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•Base Rent — income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 

•Percentage Rent — income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).

•Hotel Revenue — income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered.

•Trade Shows Revenue — income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred.

•Expense Reimbursements — revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is recognized in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.

•Management, Leasing and Other Fees — income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectability. If our assessment of the collectability of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net Operating Income by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 

On December 1, 2016 we were repaid the 85 Tenth Avenue mezzanine loans and we received a 49.9% equity interest in the property. In 2017, our 49.9% equity interest in the property is included in the "New York" segment. In 2016, our investment in 85 Tenth Avenue mezzanine loans was included in the "Other" segment. 

On July 17, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the historical financial results of our former Washington, DC segment are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are included in the Other segment. Subsequent to the Washington, DC spin-off, we operate in two segments, New York and Other, which is based on how we manage our business.

We have reclassified our 49.5% interest in 666 Fifth Avenue Office Condominium from "New York" to "Other" in all periods presented because we do not intend to hold this asset on a long-term basis. 

NOI represents total revenues less operating expenses. We consider NOI to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI should not be considered a substitute for net income. NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  

Below is a summary of NOI by segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

This increase in expense resulted primarily from the prior year reversal of $90,030,000 of valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was more-likely-than- not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from the sale of 220 Central Park South residential condominium units to realize the deferred tax assets.

Net Operating Income by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 

On December 1, 2016 we were repaid the 85 Tenth Avenue mezzanine loans and we received a 49.9% equity interest in the property. In 2017, our 49.9% equity interest in the property is included in the "New York" segment. In 2016, our investment in 85 Tenth Avenue mezzanine loans was included in the "Other" segment. 

On July 17, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our Washington, DC segment. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, the historical financial results of our former Washington, DC segment are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are included in the Other segment. Subsequent to the Washington, DC spin-off, we operate in two segments, New York and Other, which is based on how we manage our business. 

We have reclassified our 49.5% interest in 666 Fifth Avenue Office Condominium from "New York" to "Other" in all periods presented because we do not intend to hold this asset on a long-term basis. 

NOI represents total revenues less operating expenses. We consider NOI to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI should not be considered a substitute for net income. NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s, Inc.

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of Vornado’s Board of Trustee’s and its Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Urban Edge Properties

We own 4.5% of UE. In 2017 and 2016, we provided UE with information technology support. UE is providing us with leasing, development and property management services for (i) certain small retail properties that we plan to sell and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander's, Rego retail assets. Fees to UE for servicing the retail assets of Alexander’s are similar to the fees that we are receiving from Alexander’s as described in Note 5 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, are Interstate’s two other general partners. As of December 31, 2017, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 7.2% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.2% of Alexander’s common stock. 

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of 1 year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $501,000, $521,000, and $541,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loan and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity securities; and asset sales. 

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding preferred shares/units and debt securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 17, 2018, Vornado declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.63 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.52 per common share). This dividend, when declared by the Board of Trustees for all of 2018, will require Vornado to pay out approximately $479,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2018, Vornado expects to pay approximately $68,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $32,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” We have issued senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of December 31, 2017, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,817,655,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,491,062,000 of borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, net of letters of credit of $8,938,000. A summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2018 and 2019, $139,752,000 and $210,808,000, respectively, of our outstanding debt matures; we may refinance this maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facilities. We may also refinance or prepay other outstanding debt depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Details of 2017 financing activities are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2016 financing activities are discussed below.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On November 7, 2016, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from June 2017 to February 2021 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The facility fee remains unchanged at 20 basis points.

Secured Debt

On February 8, 2016, we completed a $700,000,000 refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which was swapped for four and a half years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $330,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in March 2016.

On May 16, 2016, we completed a $300,000,000 recourse financing of 7 West 34th Street. The ten-year loan is interest only at a fixed rate of 3.65% and matures in June 2026.

On September 6, 2016, we completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of theMART, a 3,652,000 square foot commercial building in Chicago. The five-year loan is interest only and has a fixed rate of 2.70%. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $124,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.57%, $550,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in December 2016.

On December 2, 2016, we completed a $400,000,000 refinancing of 350 Park Avenue, a 571,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The ten-year loan is interest only and has a fixed rate of 3.92%. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $111,000,000. The property was previously encumbered by a 3.75%, $284,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in January 2017.

Preferred Securities

On September 1, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units at their redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, or $246,250,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption. In connection therewith, we expensed $7,408,000 of issuance costs, which reduced net income attributable to common shareholders and net income attributable to Class A unitholders in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. These costs had been initially recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity and partners’ capital.

Acquisitions and Investments

Details of 2017 acquisition activity is provided in the "Overview" of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2016 acquisitions and investments are discussed below.

On March 17, 2016, we entered into a joint venture, in which we own a 33.3% interest, which owns a $150,000,000 mezzanine loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.88% and an initial maturity date in November 2016, with two three-month extension options. On November 9, 2016, the mezzanine loan was extended to May 2017 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 9.42% during the extension period. As of December 31, 2016, the joint venture has fully funded its commitments. The joint venture’s investment is subordinate to $350,000,000 of third party debt. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method.

On May 20, 2016, we contributed $19,650,000 for a 50.0% equity interest in a joint venture that will develop 606 Broadway, a 34,000 square foot office and retail building, located on Houston Street in Manhattan. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $104,000,000. At closing, the joint venture obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $25,800,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2016. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%, matures in May 2019 with two one-year extension options. Because this joint venture is a VIE and we determined we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture from the date of our investment.

A joint venture in which we have a 50.1% ownership interest is redeveloping the historic Farley Post Office building which will include a new Moynihan Train Hall and approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 120,000 square feet of retail space. As of December 31, 2017, $271,641,000 has been expended, of which our share is $136,092,000. The joint venture has also entered into a development agreement with Empire State Development (“ESD”) and a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders. Under the development agreement with ESD, the joint venture is obligated to build the Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related Companies ("Related") each guaranteeing the joint venture’s obligations. Under the design-build agreement, Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders is obligated to fulfill all of the joint venture’s obligations. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB.

Insurance 

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020. 

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,976,000 ($1,601,000 for 2018) and 17% (18% for 2018) of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC. 

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 

Generally, our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $668,000,000. 

As of December 31, 2017, $8,938,000 of letters of credit was outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

In September 2016, our 50.1% joint venture with Related was designated by ESD, an entity of New York State, to redevelop the historic Farley Post Office Building. The joint venture entered into a development agreement with ESD and a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders. Under the development agreement with ESD, the joint venture is obligated to build the Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture’s obligations. Under the design-build agreement, Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders is obligated to fulfill all of the joint venture’s obligations. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. 

As of December 31, 2017, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $42,000,000. 

As of December 31, 2017, we have construction commitments aggregating approximately $422,000,000.

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)

Vornado Realty Trust

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $717,805,000, or $3.75 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,457,583,000, or $7.66 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $153,151,000, or $0.80 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $797,734,000, or $4.20 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Details of certain items that impact FFO are discussed in the financial results summary of our “Overview.”
