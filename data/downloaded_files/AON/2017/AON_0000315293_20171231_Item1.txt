PART I

Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Aon plc (which may be referred to as “Aon,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading global professional services firm that provides advice and solutions to clients focused on risk, retirement, and health, delivering distinctive client value via innovative and effective risk management and workforce productivity solutions that are under-pinned by industry-leading data and analytics. Our strategy is to be the preeminent professional service firm in the world, focused on risk and people. 

Our clients are globally diversified and include all market segments (individuals through personal lines, mid-market companies, and large global companies) and almost every industry in the economy in over 120 countries and sovereignties. This diversification of our customer base helps provide us stability in different economic scenarios that could affect specific industries, customer segments, or geographies.

We have continued to focus our portfolio on higher margin, capital-light professional services businesses that have high recurring revenue streams and strong cash flow generation. Aon endeavors to make capital allocation decisions based upon return on invested capital (“ROIC”). 

On February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Tempo Acquisition, LLC (the “Purchase Agreement”) to sell its benefits administration and business process outsourcing business (the “Divested Business”) to an entity formed and controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”) and certain designated purchasers that are direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Buyer. On May 1, 2017, the Buyer purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of the Divested Business, plus certain related assets and liabilities, for a purchase price of $4.3 billion in cash paid at closing, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and deferred consideration of up to $500 million. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT

Beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and following the sale of our Divested Business, the Company led a set of initiatives designed to strengthen Aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency. These initiatives reinforce Aon’s ROIC decision-making process and emphasis on free cash flow. The Company is now operating as one segment that includes all of Aon’s continuing operations, which, as a global professional services firm, provides advice and solutions to clients focused on risk, retirement, and health through five principal products and service revenue lines: Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services. Collectively, these products and service revenue lines make up our one segment: Aon United. 

In 2017, our consolidated total revenue was $9,998 million. This includes $4,169 million in Commercial Risk Solutions, $1,429 million in Reinsurance Solutions, $1,755 million in Retirement Solutions, $1,515 million in Health Solutions, and $1,140 million in Data & Analytic Services, before intercompany eliminations.

Principal Products and Services

Commercial Risk Solutions includes retail brokerage, cyber solutions, global risk consulting, and captives. In retail brokerage, our team of expert risk advisors applies a client-focused approach to commercial risk products and services that leverage Aon’s global network of resources, industry-leading data and analytics, and specialized expertise.

Captives is a leading global captive insurance solutions provider that manages over 1,100 insurance entities worldwide including captives, protected segregated and incorporated cell facilities, as well as entities that support Insurance Link Securities and specialist insurance and reinsurance companies.

Reinsurance Solutions includes treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage and capital markets. Treaty reinsurance brokerage addresses underwriting and capital objectives on a portfolio level, allowing our clients to more effectively manage the combination of premium growth, return on capital, and rating agency interests. This includes the development of more competitive, innovative, and efficient risk transfer options. Facultative reinsurance brokerage empowers clients to better understand, manage, and transfer risk through innovative facultative solutions and provides the most efficient access to the global facultative markets.

Retirement consulting specializes in providing organizations across the globe with strategic design consulting on their retirement programs, actuarial services, and risk management, including pension de-risking, governance, integrated pension administration, and legal and compliance consulting. Investment consulting provides public and private companies and other institutions with advice on developing and maintaining investment programs across a broad range of plan types, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, endowments, and foundations. Our delegated investment solutions offer ongoing management of investment programs and fiduciary responsibilities either in a partial or full discretionary model for multiple asset owners.

Health and benefits brokerage partners with employers to develop innovative, customized benefits strategies that help manage risk, drive engagement, and promote accountability. Our private health exchange solutions help employers transform how they sponsor, structure, and deliver health benefits by building and operating a cost effective alternative to traditional employee and retiree healthcare. We seek outcomes of reduced employer costs, risk, and volatility, alongside greater coverage and plan choices for individual participants. 

Data & Analytic Services includes Affinity, Aon InPoint, and ReView. Affinity specializes in developing, marketing and administering customized insurance programs and specialty market solutions for Affinity organizations and their members or affiliates. Aon InPoint draws on the Global Risk Insight Platform (or “GRIP”), one of Aon’s proprietary databases, and is dedicated to making insurers more competitive by providing data, analytics, engagement, and consulting services. ReView draws on a another Aon proprietary database and broker market knowledge to provide advisory services, analysis, and benchmarking to help reinsurers more effectively meet the needs of cedents through the development of more competitive, innovative, and efficient risk transfer options.

Revenue and Compensation

Our business generates revenues primarily through commissions, compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we provide to them, and fees from clients. Commissions and fees for brokerage services vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to a client, insurer, or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies includes fees for consulting and analytics services and fees and commissions for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers. Fees from clients for advice and consulting services are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide. Payment terms are consistent with current industry practices.

Fiduciary Funds

We typically hold funds on behalf of clients, including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers. These funds held on behalf of clients are generally invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts, and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers. The principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes, though we earn interest on these accounts.

Competition

Our business operates in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. We compete with other global insurance brokers and consulting companies, including Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J Gallagher & Company, and Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc, as well as numerous specialist, regional, and local firms in almost every area of our business. We also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents, and with other businesses that do not fall into the categories above, including large financial institutions, and independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms.

Seasonality

Due to buying patterns and delivery of certain products in the markets we serve, revenues recognized tend to be higher in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.

Licensing and Regulation

Our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate, including U.S. federal and state laws. See the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Regulatory authorities in the countries and states in the United States (“U.S.”) in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individual or company licenses to act as producers, brokers, agents, third-party administrators, managing general agents, reinsurance intermediaries, or adjusters. Under the laws of most countries and states, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting, renewing, and revoking producers’, brokers’, and agents’ licenses to transact business in the country or state. The operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state, which may require, among other things, that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation. In a few countries and states, licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities. In such cases, our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state.

Our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are enforced by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), by federal and state agencies in the U.S., and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business, the licensing of agents, the monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, limits on commission rates, and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements.

Insurance authorities in the U.K., U.S., and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.

Investment, securities, and futures licensing authorities also govern certain of our business activities. For example, in the U.S., we use Aon Securities, Inc., a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation, and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Aon, for capital management transaction and advisory services and other broker-dealer activities. Similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S.

Further, pension and financial laws and regulations, including oversight and supervision by the FCA in the U.K., the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in the U.S., and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirement-related consulting services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes Aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various U.S. federal authorities including the SEC and FINRA, as well as authorities on the state level. In addition, other services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services, are subject in various jurisdictions to pension, investment, securities, and insurance laws and regulations and supervision.

Clientele

Our clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the world. No one client accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2017. Additionally, we place insurance with many insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2017.

Any or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about our performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We are under no obligation (and expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or alter any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information about factors that could materially affect Aon, including our results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
