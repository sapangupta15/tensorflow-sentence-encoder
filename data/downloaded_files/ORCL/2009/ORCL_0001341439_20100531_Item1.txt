PART I  

Item 1. Business  

General  

We are the worlds largest enterprise software company. As a result of our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) in January 2010, we are also a leading provider of hardware products and services. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software, applications software and hardware systems, consisting primarily of computer server and storage products, which are designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations.  

Our goal is to be the worlds most complete, open and integrated enterprise software and hardware company. We offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and integrated software and hardware solutions that are designed to improve transactional efficiencies, adapt to an organizations unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information and automate business processes at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets.  

We believe our internal, or organic, growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plan. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 we invested $3.3 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products, features and services. We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.  

Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.  

Software, Hardware Systems and Services  

With the acquisition of Sun, we are now organized into three businessessoftware, hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into seven operating segments. Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our services business is comprised of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) On Demand and (3) education.  

Our software, hardware systems and services businesses represented 77%, 9% and 14% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2010. Prior to our acquisition of Sun in fiscal 2010, we did not have a hardware systems segment. Our software and services businesses represented 81% and 19% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2009 and 80% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2008. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our operating segments.  

Software Business  

Our software business consists of our new software licenses segment and software license updates and product support segment.  

New Software Licenses  

The new software licenses operating segment of our software business includes the licensing of database and middleware software as well as applications software. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we acquired software technologies that expanded and enhanced our existing database and middleware software product offerings, including the Java technology platform.

Table of Contents 

Our software solutions are designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their information technology (or IT) infrastructures by delivering solutions via a standards-based, or open, integrated architecture, which allows our software products to work in customer environments that may include Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. This approach supports customer choice, reduces customer risk and can be adapted to the specific needs of any industry or application. In this model, our database and certain of our middleware offerings are designed to manage and protect a customers underlying business information, while application servers run enterprise applications that are designed to automate multiple business functions and provide intelligence in critical functional areas. Our software products are designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations, which we refer to as grid software, to support a choice of operating systems, including Solaris, Linux, Microsoft Windows and UNIX.  

New software license revenues include fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products and exclude revenues derived from software license updates and product support. The standard end user software license agreement for our products generally provides for an initial fee to use the software product in perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users or other metrics. We also have other types of software license agreements, including licenses that are restricted by the number of employees, licenses that provide for a limited term and open source licenses. New software license revenues represented 28%, 31%, and 34% of total revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

Database and Middleware Software  

Our database and middleware software offerings are designed to provide a cost-effective, high-performance platform for running and managing business applications for small and mid-size businesses, as well as large, global enterprises. Our customers are increasingly focused on reducing the total cost of their IT infrastructure and we believe that our software offerings help them achieve this goal. Our software is designed to accommodate demanding, non-stop business environments, using server, storage and application grids. These grids are designed to scale incrementally as required to address our customers IT capacity; satisfy their planning and procurement needs; support all of their business applications; lower their overall hardware investment; reduce their risk of data loss and IT infrastructure downtime; and efficiently utilize available IT resources to meet quality of service expectations. New software license revenues from database and middleware products represented 72% of our new software license revenues in both fiscal 2010 and 2009 and 68% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2008.  

Database  

The Oracle Database is the worlds most popular enterprise database and is designed to enable the secure storage, retrieval and manipulation of all forms of data, including transactional data, business application data, analytic data, and unstructured data in the form of XML files, office documents, images, video, spatial and other specialized forms of data such as human genomic and medical data. The Oracle Database is used for a variety of purposes including online transaction processing, data warehousing, as a document repository or specialized data store and as a database with packaged applications.  

The Oracle Database is available in four editions: Express Edition, Standard Edition One, Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. All editions are built using the same underlying code, which means that our database software can scale from small, single processor servers to clusters of multi-processor servers. A number of optional offerings are available with Oracle Database Enterprise Edition to address specific customer requirements in the areas of performance and scalability, high availability, data security and compliance, data warehousing, information management and systems management.

 virtual training, self-paced online training, training via CD-ROM, private events and custom training. Our live virtual class offerings allow students anywhere in the world to receive real-time, interactive training online. In addition, we also offer a certification program certifying database administrators, developers, implementers, consultants and architects. Education revenues represented 1% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010 and 2% of total revenues in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

Marketing and Sales  

We directly market and sell our products and services primarily through our subsidiary sales and service organizations to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market, and sell our products through indirect channels. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008.  

In the United States, our sales and service employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries license and support our products in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our products. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

We also market our products worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers who deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our products. By offering our partners access to our premier products, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally. Prior to our acquisition of Sun, the majority of Suns hardware systems products were sold through indirect channels. Although we plan to continue to sell our hardware products through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers, we have begun enhancing direct sales coverage for our hardware systems products and intend that our direct sales force will sell proportionately more of our hardware systems products in the future than they do currently.  

Seasonality and Cyclicality  

Our quarterly results reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and services. Our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. General economic conditions also have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions that have negatively affected our revenues. See Selected Quarterly Financial Data in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.  

Competition  

We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.  

Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware systems, which has led increasingly to our product offerings being viewed as a stack of software and hardware designed to work together in a standards-compliant environmentfrom Applications to Disk. Our enterprise software and hardware offerings compete directly with some offerings from the most competitive companies in the world, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), IBM Corporation (IBM), Hewlett Packard Company (HP), SAP AG, and Intel, as well as many

 others. In addition, the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments regularly introduce new technologies and new and growing competitors to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we will face increased competition as we will compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product categories.  

Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of management and quality of technical support. Our product sales (and the relative strength of our products versus those of our competitors) are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other things:  

       the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;  

       operating system competition among, primarily, our Solaris operating system, Microsofts Windows Server, Unix (including HP-UX from HP and AIX from IBM) and Linux;  

       the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors;  

       the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers;  

       the adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), hosted or cloud software offerings;  

       products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff;  

       products, features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and  

       attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.  

For more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Manufacturing  

To produce our hardware systems products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly, test and quality control of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we rely on third party manufacturing partners. We distribute most of our hardware systems products either from our facilities or partner facilities. One of our main goals is to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types, through a reduction of the number of assembly and distribution centers we rely on and through our transition to a build-to-order process in which products are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. For example, we have a long-standing relationship with Fujitsu Limited for the development, manufacturing and marketing of certain of our SPARC server components and products. Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.  

Research and Development  

We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents  

13  

Table of Contents 

 and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments. Research and development expenditures were $3.3 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, or 12% of total revenues in each of the aforementioned fiscal years. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software and hardware markets in which we compete. We plan on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product offerings.  

Employees  

As of May 31, 2010, we employed approximately 105,000 full-time employees, including approximately 24,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 9,000 in software license updates and product support, approximately 1,000 in the manufacturing of our hardware systems products, approximately 5,000 in hardware systems support, approximately 26,000 in services, approximately 28,000 in research and development and approximately 12,000 in general and administrative positions. Of these employees, approximately 39,000 were located in the United States and approximately 66,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries workers councils represent our employees.
