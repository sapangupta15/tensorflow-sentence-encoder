Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

CSX provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers with its approximately 32,000 dedicated employees. The Company and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the economic success and global competitiveness of the United States. This global competitiveness and the expected continued growth in manufacturing is beneficial to the rail industry. Over the long-term, the U.S. demand to move more goods by rail is expected to rise along with the need to reduce highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. CSX and freight railroads provide the most environmentally-efficient and economical means to meet this growing demand. CSX can move a ton of freight approximately 450 miles on one gallon of fuel. Shipping freight by rail also alleviates highway congestion. On average, trains are more fuel efficient than trucks as one rail car can move the equivalent of three truckloads.

CSX's network is positioned to reach nearly two-thirds of Americans, who account for the majority of the nation's consumption of goods. Through this network, the Company transports a diverse portfolio of commodities and products to meet the country's needs. These products range from agricultural goods, such as grains, to chemicals, automobiles, metals, building materials, paper, consumer products, and energy sources like coal, ethanol and crude oil. The Company categorizes these products into three primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal and coal. CSX's transportation solutions connect industries across the United States with each other and with global markets by meeting the transportation needs of port facilities, energy producers, manufacturers, industrial producers, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers and the United States armed forces. 

The rebirth of the U.S. automotive industry and the development of new domestic energy sources have led to increased volume in some of CSX's merchandise markets, specifically in shipments of automobiles, frac sand, crude oil and pipe. The recent growth in U.S. manufacturing is largely due to an increase in foreign labor costs, as well as lower domestic energy prices resulting from the increase in the supply of natural gas. These, among other, economic and supply chain factors are encouraging manufacturers to expand or move production back to the United States. The Company continues to position itself to secure volume related to growth in these markets. 

Strategic Growth Initiatives

The Company is focusing on three key strategic growth initiatives related to intermodal, export coal and an initiative to enhance customer service quality also known as Total Service Integration. The Company believes these opportunities will allow it to gain additional domestic and international volume, while improving service offerings to its customers in a cost-effective manner.

PART II

Intermodal

The Company's intermodal business is an economical, environmentally-friendly alternative to transporting freight on highways via truck. CSX is capitalizing on this opportunity by building new terminals and increasing network capacity to broaden its market presence in key growth areas. The Company's Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal, which became operational in 2011, is part of CSX's National Gateway initiative discussed below. This high-capacity terminal expands service offerings to customers, improves market access to and from east coast ports and consumption centers and enhances the fluidity of the network. During 2012, the Company completed construction of new intermodal terminals in Louisville, Kentucky and Worcester, Massachusetts and completed major terminal expansion projects in Charlotte, North Carolina and Columbus, Ohio. In addition, the Company began construction on a new intermodal terminal in Winter Haven, Florida this year. These projects further enhance the Company's intermodal offering and support the growth the Company experienced over the last few years. 

Export Coal

Economic expansion in China, India and Brazil and other developing countries has generated a growth cycle in export coal demand. Over the long term, demand for coal in these countries is expected to remain high due to rising consumption as they become more urbanized, which is increasing the need for electric power generation and steel production. These increases in global coal demand are likely to be met by shipments from coal producing countries, including the U.S, which has abundant coal deposits. In addition to the Company's ready access to large U.S. coal suppliers and multiple port facilities, CSX continues to enhance the capacity and operating efficiency of its export coal network, which favorably positions the Company to capitalize on this growth opportunity. In the long term, this export coal demand is expected to partially offset declines in domestic utility coal volume that has resulted from low natural gas prices and environmental regulation. Although the Company expects long-term growth in the export coal market, CSX export traffic volume and pricing will be subject to a high degree of volatility as a result of changes in the global economy and competition from foreign coal producers. 

Total Service Integration

CSX's Total Service Integration (“TSI”) initiative supports growth through improved service, optimized train size, and increased asset utilization for unit train shipments from origin to destination. Building on this momentum, CSX is now focusing on another initiative to enhance service quality for customers who ship by the carload. This program, TSI Carload, focuses where the customer is impacted most - during the first and last mile of service. These enhancements aim to improve service levels and reliability of rail transportation over other modes of transportation. These improvements to operational processes, customer communication and service are better aligning CSX's operating capabilities with customers' needs and enabling the Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities described above. During 2012, CSX implemented new technology and processes to provide customers with proactive and transparent communications. These tools include real time notifications of departures and work to be completed, proactive alerts for cars that may be delayed and notices for work that will not be performed.

PART II

Public-Private Partnerships

Expanding capacity on U.S. rail networks provides substantial public benefits including job creation, increased business activity at U.S. ports, reduced highway congestion and lower air emissions. Therefore, CSX and its government partners are working jointly to invest in multi-year rail infrastructure projects such as the National Gateway. This initiative is a public-private partnership which will increase intermodal capacity and create substantial environmental and efficiency advantages by clearing key corridors between Mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest for double-stack intermodal trains. 

CSX is engaged in another major partnership initiative with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to expand freight and commuter rail service. This partnership provided an expanded intermodal terminal footprint, relocation of bulk commodity operations and double-stack intermodal clearance from Worcester to the New York state line. In 2012, CSX sold its corridor between Boston and Worcester to the Commonwealth to allow increased commuter rail service while retaining the right to utilize this corridor for freight service.

CSX entered into a transaction with the state of Florida in 2011 to help alleviate highway congestion through a new commuter rail operation, known as SunRail. CSX sold a portion of its track to the state of Florida for its new commuter rail and will invest the proceeds in additional freight rail capacity and infrastructure within the state. 

Balanced Approach to Cash Deployment

CSX remains highly committed to delivering value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business, dividend growth and share repurchases. In 2012, the Company invested $2.3 billion to further enhance the capacity, quality, safety and flexibility of its network. Included in this amount is $166 million of investments related to reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. In addition, CSX continues to return value to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The Company has increased its quarterly cash dividend 10 times over the last seven year period which represents a 33 percent compounded annual growth rate. In 2012, CSX completed a $2 billion share repurchase authority that was announced in 2011. While delivering shareholder value through this balanced approach to cash deployment, the Company remains committed to an improving investment grade credit profile.

In summary, these strategic initiatives and long-term investments discussed above provide a foundation for volume growth and productivity improvement, enhanced customer service and continued advancements in the safety and reliability of operations. To continue these types of investments, the Company must be able to operate in an environment in which it can generate adequate returns and drive shareholder value. CSX will continue to advocate for a fair and balanced regulatory environment to ensure that the value of the Company's rail service would be reflected in any potential new legislation or policies.

2012 HIGHLIGHTS

Operating income increased 1% to $3.5 billion and the operating ratio improved 30 basis points to 70.6%. Both improved on the strength of efficiency gains and resource adjustments. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012, revenue was slightly higher year-over-year despite lower volume. Volume decreased 1% from prior year as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume. Pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets. 

 Expenses were lower when compared to prior year for several reasons. Real estate gains as well as lower incentive compensation and cost savings from crew labor efficiencies and lower volume reduced expenses. These decreases were offset by higher depreciation and inflation-related costs. 

For additional information, refer to Results of Operations discussed on pages 33 through 36.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

In addition to the financial highlights described above, the Company measures and reports safety and service performance. The Company strives for continuous improvement in these measures through training, initiatives and investment. For example, the Company's safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement. The programs utilize operating rules training, compliance measurement, root cause analysis and communication that are intended to create a safer environment for employees and the public. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.

The Company routinely collaborates with the FRA and industry organizations as well as federal, state and local governments on the development and implementation of safety programs and initiatives. For example, CSX, Operation Lifesaver, Inc., the U.S. Department of Transportation and other major railroads from across the country have partnered in the Common Sense campaign to reduce the number of injuries and deaths around tracks and trains. In addition to these initiatives, CSXT also has an ongoing public safety program to clear-cut trees and vegetation at public passive highway-rail intersections (crossings with no flashing lights or gates) to improve the public's ability to discern rail hazards.

At CSX, operational success is built on employee commitment to customer service while at the same time maintaining a constant focus on safety. In 2012, both key safety measures improved significantly versus the previous year. The FRA reportable personal injury frequency index improved by 26 percent year over year to a record low of 0.69, showing extraordinary employee dedication to the Company's safety initiative. The reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 18 percent year over year to 1.98.

Network reliability and service metrics showed strong improvements during 2012. On-time originations improved 24 percent to a record 89 percent, and on-time arrivals improved 29 percent to 80 percent. Average train velocity increased 10 percent to 22.7 miles per hour, while dwell improved 8 percent to 23.7 hours.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. As described below, free cash flow before dividends decreased $601 million year over year to $721 million. The primary reasons for the decrease in free cash flow from the previous year are higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements and a pension contribution. 

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

33
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

2012 vs. 2011 Results of Operations

CSX full year results reflect a 1% year-over-year volume decline as lower coal shipments were partially offset by growth in intermodal and automotive volume. Pricing gains and higher fuel recovery drove increases in revenue per unit in all markets. As a result, total revenue was slightly higher year-over-year.

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products - Volume decreased due to reduced shipments of corn and ethanol. Corn shipments for animal feed declined as drought conditions in the Midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher. Further contributing to this decline, customers in the Southeast took advantage of lower cost imported grains and a strong local crop, both of which are transported by truck. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and reduced gasoline demand.

Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume was flat year-over-year. Fertilizer shipments were lower in the first half of the year as the expectation of moderating prices resulted in delayed purchases by farmers. This decline in the first half was offset by growth in fertilizer in the second half resulting from low river levels that shifted business that traditionally moves via barge to rail. Additionally, producers advanced shipments of fertilizer in the fourth quarter in anticipation of an expected increased application by farmers in 2013. 

Food and Consumer - Volume declined year-over-year. Appliance shipments were lower due to intermodal conversions, lower sales incentives by manufacturers and a moderating economy. The decline in appliances was partially offset by growth in refrigerated products due to highway-to-rail conversions.

Industrial

Chemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related markets (that include frac sand, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and crude oil) due to the increase in shale drilling activity. Additionally, plastics shipments grew to support growth predominately in automotive and packaging.

Automotive - Volume grew as North American light vehicle production increased 17% to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the U.S. reached record highs.

Metals - Volume was slightly lower primarily due to the decline in scrap shipments as a result of lower steel mill utilization rates and lower scrap exports driven by moderating global demand.

Housing and Construction

Emerging Markets - Volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) resulting from the completion of several road construction projects versus the prior year. Additionally, shipments of salt declined in the early part of this year as inventories remained high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter. 

Forest Products - Volume increased in building products due to recovering demand for housing and construction, which was partially offset by a decline in the paper markets affected by electronic media substitution.

34
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Coal

Shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices, which drove displacement of coal at utilities served by CSX. In addition, utility stockpiles remained well above target levels and overall electric generation in the eastern U.S. declined. Utility coal declines were partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of U.S. thermal coal. In 2012, CSX shipped 47.8 million tons of export coal.

Intermodal

Intermodal volume increased due to growth in both domestic and international markets. Domestic shipment growth resulted from highway-to-rail conversions and increased demand from both new and existing customers. International growth was driven by a new customer and expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the Northwest Ohio terminal. 

Expense

In 2012, total expenses decreased $26 million compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses decreased $53 million primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense and crew labor costs. Crew labor costs decreased as volume declined as well as efficiencies gained from management's action to reduce resources. These decreases were partially offset by wage inflation and increased pension and other post-employment benefit expense.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense decreased by $73 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:

•Gains recognized increased $102 million year-over-year, primarily related to the additional recognition of the deferred gain from the prior year sale of an operating corridor to the State of Florida of $80 million. 

•As a result of efficiency initiatives and the decline in volume, the reduction of active locomotives drove a decrease in material and repair costs. 

•Continued improvement in safety trends lowered casualty expenses. 

• Although the number of train accidents continued to decline, a few costly derailments more than offset these decreases.

•Inflation also partially offset the items above.

35
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $4 million primarily due to a 4% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.12 to $3.18 in 2012 versus a year ago. The increase in average fuel price was partially offset by decreased volume and improved network efficiency and fuel saving initiatives.

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $83 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending as well as cycling of a prior year favorable adjustment to asset retirements.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $13 million primarily related to higher automotive volume partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization.

Other

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $14 million to $566 million primarily due to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates. The primary use of proceeds from the 2012 debt issuances was for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness due in both 2012 and early 2013 as well as a contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans.

Other Income – Net

Other income - net increased $51 million to $73 million primarily related to a gain on the sale of a non-operating real estate.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $39 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to higher earnings during 2012 and the cycling of prior year state income tax related adjustments.

Net Earnings

Net earnings increased $37 million to $1.9 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.12 to $1.79 due to the factors mentioned above Lower average shares outstanding also had a positive impact on earnings per diluted share.

37
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

2011 vs. 2010 Results of Operations

CSX full year results reflect positive year-over-year volume and revenue growth as demand for rail service in the markets CSX serves continued to support profitable growth. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in all markets. Fiscal year 2010 results include an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year 2011.

Volume and Revenue

Merchandise

Agricultural

Agricultural Products – Volume declined as the amount of feed shipments declined as a result of higher corn prices and decreased production from producers of poultry and pork. These reductions were slightly offset by growth in ethanol and increased shipments of soybeans into the Southeast due to low inventories. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Shipments of domestic fertilizers grew as farmers replenished inventories to improve crop yields as a result of higher anticipated crop prices. Export demand was also strong with recovery in exports to Central and South America after the prior year's drought. Shipments of phosphate rock, which is used to make fertilizer, grew as suppliers are stocking up in anticipation of a strong spring season.

Food and Consumer – Volume decreased as lower appliance shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing sector was partially offset by strength in truckload conversions of refrigerated products and manufactured goods.

Industrial

Chemicals – Volume was flat as strength in frac sand (used in the extraction of gas and petroleum) resulted from the increase in natural gas drilling. This increase was offset by a reduction in basic chemical markets, like plastics, which experienced weak consumer demand and inventory destocking.

Automotive - Automotive volume grew as North American automotive production increased to meet pent up demand from delayed purchases during the slowed economy over the last few years.

Metals – Volume growth was driven by strong export demand for scrap shipments and higher domestic steel production resulting from strong demand in the automotive and oil and gas sectors for products such as sheet steel and pipe.

Housing and Construction

Emerging Markets – Volume increased primarily driven by improved shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel), cement and waste (such as construction and demolition debris) as a result of new distribution facilities and overall market growth related to the improving economy. 

Forest Products – Volume increased, despite the weakness in housing-related markets, primarily related to strength in shipments of pulp board and paper used in packaging for consumer products and increased shipments of building products resulting from inventory replenishments.

38
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Coal

Shipments of utility coal declined as electrical generation declined in the eastern U.S., natural gas prices remained low and utility stockpiles were above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by greater demand for U.S. coal in Europe, South America and Asia. During 2011, CSX shipped 40.2 million tons of export coal. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by improved yield, positive mix and fuel recovery. 

Intermodal

International and domestic shipment growth resulted from expanded service offerings, over-the-road conversions, and service and network enhancements. The increase in revenue per unit was driven by increased fuel recovery, improved yields and favorable traffic mix. This revenue-per-unit increase was partially offset by the impact of switching from a purchased transportation arrangement to a domestic interline program in the prior year. This program, known as UMAX, provides customers with containers for local shipments or transcontinental service provided jointly by CSX and Union Pacific Corporation.

Other

Other revenue increased due to stronger affiliate revenue and higher incidental charges mostly offset by lower benefits for contract volume commitments as compared to the prior year. 

Expense

In 2011, total expenses increased $760 million or 10% to $8.3 billion compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $116 million primarily driven by inflation, increased resource levels and other labor-related costs associated with training focused on service improvements partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at automotive facilities as well as professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total materials, supplies and other expense increased by $154 million in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the following:

•Volume-related expenses and inflation increased as a result of higher operating and maintenance costs at automotive facilities, coal piers and intermodal terminals. Additionally, maintenance expense increased due to a higher active count of locomotives in service as compared to prior year. Higher travel costs for train crews and other volume-related expenses also contributed to this increase. 

•Casualty expenses increased year-over-year primarily due to the prior year benefit of $49 million not repeated in the current year. This benefit was a result of improvements in safety and occupational claim trends.

39
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

•Expense increases were partially offset by approximately $37 million of reduced transportation costs as a result of switching from a purchased transportation agreement to the UMAX domestic interline program in 2010. Additionally, an operating property transaction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts closed during 2010 and resulted in a $30 million net book loss on a pre-tax basis. 

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $456 million primarily due to a 26% increase in average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. Average fuel price per gallon increased $0.80 from $2.26 in 2010 to $3.06 in 2011.

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $29 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending partially offset by a multi-year adjustment related to retirements as well as the impact of prior year's additional expense related to the extra week.

Equipment and Other includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses increased $5 million primarily due to volume-related expenses partially offset by cost savings associated with improved asset utilization. 

Other

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $5 million to $552 million primarily due to lower average interest rates offset by higher average debt balances during 2011.

Other Income – Net

Other income - net decreased $10 million to $22 million related to lower real estate sales and increased non-operating expenses.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $83 million to $1.1 billion due to higher earnings during 2011 offset by certain state income tax related adjustments compared to a year ago.

Net Earnings

Net earnings increased $259 million to $1.8 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $0.32 to $1.67 in 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income net of income taxes in 2011.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to implement regulatory and legislative initiatives. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Significant Cash Flows

Consolidated Balance Sheets

CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend improvement and share repurchases.

Total assets increased $1.2 billion from prior year. Assets increased primarily due to the increase in net properties of $1.1 billion driven by planned capital spending.

Total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.2 billion. Increases were from total net debt activity of $591 million mostly due to additional borrowings; higher deferred income tax liability of $495 million primarily related to the net impact of bonus depreciation on tax accruals; and stronger net earnings of $1.9 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were share repurchases of $734 million, dividends paid of $558 million and a pension plan contribution of $275 million. 

Sources of Cash

The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2012, the Company generated $2.9 billion of cash from operating activities which decreased $545 million from prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by a contribution to the Company's qualified pension plans and higher payments for income taxes as well as payments related to the ratification of labor agreements in 2012. In 2011, the Company generated $3.5 billion of cash from operating activities which represented a $230 million increase from the prior year, driven by higher earnings. 

Second, CSX has access to numerous financing sources including a $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2016. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.

CSX filed its shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 15, 2013. This shelf registration statement is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.

Uses of Cash

CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. In 2012, net cash used in investing activities was driven by $2.3 billion of property additions, which was consistent with the prior year. In 2011, net cash used in investing activities was also driven by $2.3 billion of property additions which increased $457 million from prior year.

 The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Planned capital investments for 2013 are $2.3 billion, including expected spending of approximately $325 million for Positive Train Control ("PTC"). This amount excludes investments related to partially or wholly reimbursable public-private partnerships where reimbursements may not be fully received in a given year. Over half of the 2013 investment will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to locomotives, freight cars, high return projects that drive growth and productivity such as intermodal terminal capacity and major track expansion along the River Line between northern New Jersey and the Albany, N.Y., region. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations. 

Over the long term, the Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be at least $1.7 billion. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending life-to-date through 2012 was approximately $585 million.

In addition to capital investments, the Company uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. In 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $668 million, which was a decrease in spending of $745 million. Share repurchases were lower by $830 million and partially offsetting this were higher dividend payments of $78 million as a result of an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share in second quarter 2012. 

42
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

In 2011, net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion which increased $186 million from the prior year primarily as a result of $1.6 billion of share repurchases partially offset by net debt in 2011. CSX paid dividends of $480 million in 2011, which was $108 million more than prior year. This increase was due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share at the beginning of 2011 and then to $0.12 in second quarter 2011.

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations. Although new legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K), it is too early to predict the manner or severity of such impact. 

Liquidity and Working Capital

Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX has a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility expires in September 2016 and as of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility. Additionally in 2012, CSX issued a total of $1.1 billion of new long-term debt. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock and dividends to shareholders. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements. 

The Company's $250 million receivables securitization facility has a 364-day term and expires in December 2013. The Company's intention is to continue to renew this facility prior to its expiration. The purpose of this facility is to provide an alternative to commercial paper and a low cost source of short-term liquidity. Under the terms of this facility, CSXT transfers eligible third-party receivables to CSX Trade Receivables, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary. A separate subsidiary of CSX services the receivables. Upon transfer, the receivables become assets of CSX Trade Receivables and are not available to the creditors of CSX or any of its other subsidiaries. In the event CSX Trade Receivables draws under this facility, the Company will record an equivalent amount of debt on its consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this filing, the Company has no outstanding balances under this facility.

Working capital can also be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $174 million and $248 million at December 2012 and 2011, respectively. This lower surplus since the prior year is primarily due to reclassification of current portion of long-term debt that will mature within a year This decline was offset by payments made for incentive compensation and other labor and fringe liabilities as well as for short-term debt paid. Also, see sources and uses of cash description above.

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, trade receivable facility and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings have improved during 2012. Currently, CSX is rated BBB with a positive outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's, compared to a rating of BBB with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a positive outlook by Moody's at December 2011. Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

For detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:

•casualty, environmental and legal reserves;

•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;

•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and

•income taxes. 

Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves

Casualty

Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury, occupational injury and asbestos claims. During 2010 the Company increased its self-insured retention amount for these claims from $25 million to $50 million per occurrence for claims occurring on or after June 1, 2010. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company's self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in independent third-party estimates, which are reviewed by management. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.

Most of the claims relate to CSXT unless otherwise noted below. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.

As of December 2012, the Company had $325 million in casualty reserves. See below for details regarding changes in estimate for casualty reserves.

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Personal Injury

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.

CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience.

During 2012 and 2011, there were no significant changes in estimates in personal injury reserves. Adjustments to the reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Occupational & Asbestos

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (from exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.

The Company is also party to a number of asbestos claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees resulted from work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. Other types of exposures, however, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until these exposures were substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business. Diseases associated with asbestos typically have long latency periods (amount of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of the disease) which can range from 10 to 40 years after exposure.

Occupational and asbestos claims are analyzed by a third-party actuary or specialist (the "third-party specialist"), respectively, in order to determine the number of unasserted or incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Analyses of both types of claims are performed by the third-party specialist and reviewed by management. This review is quarterly for occupational claims and annually for asbestos claims. Since exposure to asbestos has been substantially eliminated, this review is completed annually. For asserted occupational and asbestos claims, management reviews quarterly. With the exception of carpal tunnel, management has determined that seven years is the most probable time period in which unasserted claim filings and claim values can be estimated. Carpal tunnel claims use a three-year period to estimate the reserve due to the shorter latency period for these types of injuries.

The third-party specialists analyze CSXT’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to determine future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values for occupational and asbestos claims reserves. The potentially exposed population is estimated by using CSX employment records and industry data. From this analysis, the third-party specialists provide an estimate of the IBNR claims liability.

46
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for these reserves. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of occupational and asbestos IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in approximately a $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted occupational and asbestos claims.

During 2012 and 2011, there were no significant changes in estimates recorded to adjust occupational or asbestos reserves. Adjustments in reserves are included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.

Environmental

The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 248 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.

In accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:

•type of clean-up required;

•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);

•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and

•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

As of December 2012, the Company had $88 million in environmental reserves. These recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but exclude any anticipated insurance recoveries. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund the current remedial actions.

Legal

In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards.

See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of these items.

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.  As of December 2012, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was $3.0 billion. During the first quarter 2012, the Company made a contribution of $275 million to its qualified pension plans, of which $25 million was the required minimum contribution.

48
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a self-insured post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Prior to 2011, the post-retirement medical plan was partially funded by all participating retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Beginning in 2011, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:

•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;

•long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•salary scale inflation rates; and

•other assumptions.

The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, salary scale inflation rates and other assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.

Discount Rates

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2012 pension and post-retirement obligations are 3.75% and 3.20%, respectively. For 2011, the discount rate used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations was 4.75% and 4.25%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2012, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its pension obligation was 7.75% and 8% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Salary Scale Inflation Rates

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 3.75% and 4% to value its 2012 and 2011 pension obligations, respectively.

Other Assumptions

The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are selected by management.

2013 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense

Net pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2013 is expected to be approximately $95 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to $81 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2012. The increase in the pension expense is primarily related to additional amortization of the actuarial losses incurred by the pension plan and the decrease in the discount rate (which causes expense to increase), partially offset by the return on discretionary contributions made during 2012.

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2012 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method

The Company depreciates its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise over 85% of total fixed assets of $35 billion on a gross basis at December 2012. All other assets of the Company are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its recoverable life.

The Company currently utilizes more than 130 different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method of accounting. Examples of depreciable asset categories include 18 different categories for crossties due to the different combinations of density classifications and asset types. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.

The Company believes the group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g., track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most effective way to properly depreciate its assets.

Under the group-life method of accounting, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's assumptions regarding the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study (also referred to as a life study) is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed for equipment assets every three years and for road (e.g. bridges and signals) and track (e.g., rail, ties and ballast) assets every six years. The Company believes the frequency currently required by the STB provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.

Changes in asset service lives due to the results of the depreciation studies are applied on a prospective basis and could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.

There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:

•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;

•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;

•evaluation of current operations;

•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;

•previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;

•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and

•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

51
CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Critical Accounting Estimates, continued

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. As individual assets within a specific group are retired, resulting gains and losses are recorded in accumulated depreciation. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with group-life is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.

In the event that large groups of assets are removed from service as a result of unusual acts or sales, resulting gains and losses are recognized immediately. These acts are not considered to be in the normal course of business and are therefore recognized when incurred. Examples of such acts would be the major destruction of assets due to significant storm damage (e.g., major hurricanes), the sale of a rail line segment to another railroad or the disposal of an entire class of assets (e.g., disposal of all refrigerated freight cars).

Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes which did not materially affect the Company’s annual depreciation expense of $1.1 billion and $1 billion for 2012 and 2011, respectively. A 1% change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $10 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. In 2012, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets and a technical update (an update to the prior depreciation study) for its road and track assets. Additionally, in 2009, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets. These studies resulted in an annual net reduction in depreciation expense which were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Income Taxes

CSX accounts for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic in the ASC that addresses how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this topic, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2010. The federal income tax return for 2011 currently is under review. During 2012, the Company participated in a contemporaneous Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of tax year 2012. Management believes an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. As of December 2012, the Company’s uncertain tax positions were $24 million.
