Item 1A. Risk Factors  

This report contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Such statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.  

Risks Related to our Business  

The current crisis affecting world financial markets may adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs. The current uncertainty surrounding world financial markets may result in the purchasers of medical equipment

 decreasing their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Additionally, constrictions in world credit markets may result in our customers having increased difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products which may result in decreased sales. Widespread economic uncertainty may also result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists which could result in reduced demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates offered by government sponsored healthcare programs. If the current economic condition results in the occurrence of any of these events, our business and prospects may be adversely affected. 

Sales and market acceptance of our products is dependent on third party reimbursement. Failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects.  

Sales and market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. The costs of our products to customers are substantial, and market acceptance of our products will continue to depend upon our customers ability to obtain an appropriate level of reimbursement from third-party payors for use of such products. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, known as CMS, establish guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Under current CMS guidelines, varying reimbursement levels have been established for our products and procedures. The actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state Medicare carriers and, for non-Medicare and Medicaid patients, private insurance carriers. There are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by CMS and by a state Medicare carrier and private insurance carriers. Moreover, states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the CMS reimbursement guidelines. The use of our products outside the United States is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments reimbursements and regulatory positions and insurance carriers.  

In June and July 2008, CMS announced proposed 2009 reimbursement rates for physician, hospital and ambulatory surgical center payments. Reimbursement rates also reflect a Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) reduction which requires that reimbursement rates factor in a 5.4% reduction in physician payments under the physician fee schedule as determined by the SGR formula and Congressional legislation. CMS also implemented provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 related to certain medical imaging procedures. For 2009, the changes that affect us include the following: a decline of approximately 0% to 5% in digital and analog mammography screening and diagnostic reimbursement rates and an approximate 19% decline in reimbursement for CAD, which reflects the third year of the four year phase-in of an approximate 50% decline announced in 2006 in addition to the SGR reduction. The proposed 2009 decline in reimbursement for bone density assessments for osteoporosis (DXA) testing is approximately 24%, reflecting the third year of the four year phase-in of an approximate 70% decline announced in 2006 in addition to the SGR reduction. Medicare payments for 2009 for our other products are effected primarily by the SGR reduction, and will decline by less than approximately 8%, with in-office payments for NovaSure and MammoSite balloon catheter placement declining by approximately 13%. Hospital outpatient department and Ambulatory Surgical Center payments for our products will increase by approximately 2% to 10%. Payments for placement of MammoSite brachytherapy source placement are decreasing by approximately 40% in Free-standing Radiation Oncology Centers.  

Our business may be harmed by our recently completed acquisitions and our merger with Cytyc.  

We recently acquired a number of businesses, technologies, product lines, and products, including Third Wave, Cytyc, BioLucent, Adeza and Adiana. The success of these acquisitions will depend on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. We may fail to realize these anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:  

       problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:  

19  

Table of Contents 

       diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;  

       failure to retain and motivate key employees;  

       failure to successfully obtain FDA approval or clearance for products under development;  

       failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;  

       failure of customers to accept new products;  

       failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;  

       failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;  

       failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;  

       potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;  

       potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems;  

       potential difficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the SEC; and  

       potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition of such companies, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;  

       we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;  

       an acquisition may result in future impairment charges related to diminished fair value of businesses acquired as compared to the price we paid for them;  

       an acquisition may involve restructuring operations or reductions in workforce which may result in substantial charges to our operations;  

       an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations; and  

       the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax decisions and/or changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.  

Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses could harm our business and prospects and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  

Our success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and enhancements to our existing products.  

We have continuing research and development programs designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products. We are expending significant resources on the enhancement of our current products as well as on the development of digital x-ray imaging products, including the development of a digital mammography product to perform breast tomosynthesis, a 3-dimensional imaging technique, the continued development of Third Waves Cervista HPV products and high volume automation solution, and the further development of new molecular diagnostic products focused on womens health. We have also committed significant resources to our efforts to achieve FDA approval for our permanent female contraception product.   

20  

Table of Contents 

 The successful development of our products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       unanticipated delays in development or the FDAs approval or clearance process;  

       access to capital;  

       budget overruns;  

       third party intellectual property;  

       technical problems; and  

       other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval applications for products or 510(k) clearance.  

Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction, our product development efforts may not be completed on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our failure to develop new products and product enhancements, such as our digital mammography tomosynthesis product, the Cervista HPV products and our permanent female contraception procedure on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects.  

Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight. Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements, such as our digital mammography tomosynthesis product, our permanent female contraception product and our Cervista HPV products, could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. Recently we have encountered unanticipated delays in the FDA approval process relating to both our digital mammography tomosynthesis product and our permanent female contraception product. Additionally, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.  

Medical devices cannot be marketed in the United States without clearance or approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect its safety or effectiveness require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civic sanctions, including but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties.  

Medical devices sold in the United States must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.  

The markets for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected.  

The successful commercialization of our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;  

21  

Table of Contents 

       trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;  

       perceptions of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;  

       recommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers;  

       the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;  

       competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and  

       other technological developments.  

Often, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not addressed until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment. If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our products and treatments, such as our digital mammography tomosynthesis product, due to, among other things, the lack of reimbursement codes or disadvantageous reimbursement levels for such products or treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.  

The historical levels of sales growth experienced by our products may not be indicative of future growth as the markets for our products mature.  

Historically, the demand for our technologies and treatments is greatest upon their initial introduction. However, once markets mature, growth in the market may abruptly stop or significantly slow or demand may decline. The demand for certain of our products, such as our direct-to-digital full-field mammography products and our NovaSure endometrial ablation system that initially experienced rapid growth, may not continue to reflect historical levels and we cannot predict when, or at what rate, this demand may decline. Reduced growth rates and slackening demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and profitability.  

We are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of the ThinPrep System and our molecular diagnostic products added with the Third Wave acquisition.  

We are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of the ThinPrep System and our molecular diagnostic products that were added with the Third Wave acquisition. Due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest United States laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories. Our business and prospects may be harmed if we are unable to increase sales to, or maintain pricing levels with our existing customers and establish new customers both within and outside the United States.  

The uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects.  

In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including efforts at national healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could:  

       limit the use of our products;  

22  

Table of Contents 

       reduce reimbursement available for such use; or  

       adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted.  

These reforms or cost containment measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could harm our business and prospects.  

Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.  

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. We have been involved in infringement litigation, and may in the future be notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties.  

As examples, we are currently defending ourselves against infringement complaints filed by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson operating company, Tissue Extraction Devices, LLC, and Digene Corporation; and we have previously defended against a claim of infringement by Tripath Imaging, Inc., which was settled in Fiscal 2008. For further information regarding these complaints, please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  

In connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.  

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.  

We have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe, copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. In addition, we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties which relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States intellectual property laws. Even if we believed our proprietary information is protected by patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. As a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.

Our international operations expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.   

We are subject to a number of additional risks and expenses due to our international operations. Any of these risks or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. These risks and expenses include:  

       difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;  

       protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;  

       greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection;  

       difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;  

       expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;  

       possible adverse tax consequences;  

       the inability to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements;  

       the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;  

       governmental currency controls;  

       multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements, international trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);  

       reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  

       political and economic changes and disruptions;  

       clone or knock off products;  

       export/import controls; and  

       tariff regulations.  

Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.  

We maintain sales and service offices outside the United States, have manufacturing facilities in Germany, Costa Rica and China, and conduct business worldwide. The expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies, except at our Costa Rica subsidiary, where the majority of business is conducted in U.S. dollars, and our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the Euro or U.S. dollars, with a majority of our sales to international dealers denominated in U.S. dollars.  

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency. We have historically hedged, and may in the future hedge, our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local European currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices. In addition, our AEG operation has engaged in hedging activities, such as currency swaps, to hedge our foreign currency exposure. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure.  

Recently the value of the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the value of many foreign currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar makes dollar denominated sales less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and margins over time. In addition, the value of our sales denominated in foreign currencies will decrease as the U.S. dollar strengthens. We believe that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, if it persists, may have a material adverse effect on our international sales and margins.

Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.  

We manufacture our products at a number of different facilities located throughout the world. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Our manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could harm our business and prospects. Because some of our manufacturing operations are located in Germany, China and Costa Rica, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described below. We have recently completed construction of a new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica. There is a risk that we will not be able to successfully obtain the regulatory approval for this facility in a timely manner and this could adversely impact our business and prospects.  

Our business could be harmed if products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications.  

We are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. Newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity, mandatory or voluntary recall or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. This reliance could harm our business and prospects.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. Any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales.  

Our success depends on our ability to manage growth effectively.  

Our operations and facilities, including the number of employees and the geographic area of operations, have grown rapidly. Our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business and prospects. Such growth may significantly strain our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. To manage such growth effectively, it is expected that we will continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls, and to effectively retain, expand, train and manage our employee base.  

We face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.  

A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. Some of our competitors are large companies that may enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including:  

       significantly greater name recognition;  

       established distribution networks;  

25  

Table of Contents 

       additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain competitive advantage;  

       more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and financial capabilities; and  

       better positioning to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.  

The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Other companies may develop products that are superior to or less expensive, or both, than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introductions of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.  

If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.  

Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.  

The markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. These trends will likely continue into the foreseeable future. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance. If we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.  

Our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation.  

Our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:  

       the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;  

       the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;  

       the development status and demand for our products;  

       the development status and demand for therapies to treat breast cancer and osteoporosis;  

       economic conditions in our markets;  

       foreign exchange rates;  

       the timing of orders;  

       the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;  

       the mix of products we sell;  

       regulatory approval of products;  

       the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       pricing and other competitive conditions;  

       unanticipated expenses; and  

       complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).  

Customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.

Recent proposed changes to reclassify full-field digital mammography to permit 510(k) clearance could increase competition for our digital mammography products.  

On May 23, 2006 the FDA Radiological Devices Panel recommended the reclassification of full-field digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II devices. The FDA has issued guidance on full field digital mammography for public comment during 2008. If the FDA implements the panels recommendation, the reclassification would allow full-field digital mammography systems to be cleared for commercialization through the 510(k) process, which is less rigorous than the present pre-market approval process. If and when implemented, the reclassification for full-field digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II devices may lower barriers of entry into the digital mammography market, may result in more competitors entering the United States market and could harm sales of our digital mammography systems.  

Our products may be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which could harm our business and prospects.  

The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of medical products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall could harm the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false or fraudulent claims.  

We are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices is ever evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects.  

We are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products.  

Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that products competitive position in the market.  

The sale and use of one of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, inaccurate test results or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our   

27  

Table of Contents 

 product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of managements attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, and could harm our business and prospects.  

We use hazardous materials and products.  

Our research and development and manufacturing involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. We are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.  

Our future success depends on the continued services of key personnel.  

The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or strategic objectives. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel, particularly software engineers and other technical personnel, is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.  

Our business may be harmed by acquisitions we complete in the future.  

Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of acquisition candidates, including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business, diversion of our managements attention and risks and costs associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as litigation, investigations or inquiries in connection with acquisitions that we complete. If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we will be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete. Should we acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business.  

Our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects.  

We have entered into alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships. Alliances with certain partners or companies could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Moreover, we may not be able to:  

       identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures;  

       assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated;  

       successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us; or  

       successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.

Furthermore, any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture, failing to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively, or failing to comply with obligations in connection therewith, could harm our business and prospects.  

An adverse change in the projected cash flows from our acquired businesses or the business climate in which they operate, including the continuation of the current financial and economic turmoil, could require us to incur an impairment charge which would have an adverse impact on our operating results.  

We periodically review the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets reflected in our financial statements to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. Conditions that would indicate impairment and necessitate a revaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. If the carrying value of an asset is determined to be impaired we will write-down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. We generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. As of September 27, 2008, we had approximately $7.4 billion of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Subsequent to September 27, 2008, we have experienced a decline in the price of our publicly-traded common stock and related market capitalization such that our market capitalization has declined below the book value of our net assets. We evaluated this decline in our market capitalization subsequent to September 27, 2008 and have concluded that it was not an indicator of an impairment that existed as of September 27, 2008. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization compared to the book value of our net assets. It is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic turmoil could negatively affect our anticipated cash flows, or the discount rate that is applied to valuing those cash flows, to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test in fiscal 2009. Such a requirement could result in a material impairment charge that would have an adverse impact on our operating results.  

We are exposed to potential risks and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  

We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008 and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if, when aggregated, they constitute a material weakness. As a result of this evaluation, no material weaknesses were identified.  

We expect to continue to incur significant costs, including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels, in order to maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We continue to monitor controls for any weaknesses or deficiencies. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, as we continue to expand globally, the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls will increase and will require that we continue to improve our internal controls over financial reporting.  

In 2008, we acquired Third Wave and we expect to include Third Wave in our assessment of internal control over financial reporting in fiscal 2009. We expect to face additional challenges in implementing the required processes, procedures and controls as a result of the acquisition and other acquired operations. Although we intend to devote time and incur costs, as necessary, to ensure ongoing compliance, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  

In the future, if we fail to complete the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 evaluation in a timely manner, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot attest in a timely manner to our evaluation, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls which could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may

 identify material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting which may result in a loss of public confidence in our internal controls and adversely impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, any failure to implement required, new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.  

Risks Related to our Indebtedness  

We incurred significant indebtedness in order to finance the merger with Cytyc Corporation and our acquisition of Third Wave, which limits our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.  

In order to finance the cash portion of the merger with Cytyc and other expenses in connection with the merger we incurred over $2.35 billion of new indebtedness under various senior secured term loan facilities (collectively, the Cytyc Facilities). On December 10, 2007, we issued $1.725 billion of 2.0% convertible notes due 2037 (the Convertible Notes), which are unsecured and subordinated to our secured indebtedness. The Cytyc Facilities were repaid in full as of June 28, 2008, using the net proceeds from our issuance of the Convertible Notes and our voluntary prepayment of principal. The Convertible Notes remain outstanding at September 27, 2008.  

In connection with our acquisition of Third Wave, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement in order to replace the Cytyc Facilities with $540 million of new indebtedness, including approximately $400 million under a senior secured tranche A term loan facility which matures on September 30, 2012 and $140 million under a senior secured tranche B term loan facility which matures on March 31, 2013 (collectively, the New Credit Facilities). Additionally, certain other of our indebtedness may remain outstanding. Our New Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates. Our level of indebtedness may:  

       make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;  

       increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;  

       require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;  

       limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  

       place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  

       limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.  

In addition, the terms of our New Credit Facilities contain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on the ability to:  

       incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets;  

       engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets;  

       enter into sale-leaseback transactions;  

       pay dividends or make other distributions;  

       voluntarily prepay other indebtedness;  

       enter into transactions with affiliated persons;  

       make investments; and  

       change the nature of our businesses.

Our New Credit Facilities also require us to satisfy certain financial covenants.  

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our New Credit Facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the defaulted debt may be permitted to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities.  

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our obligations, including our obligations under our credit facilities.  

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance the indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities and the Convertible Notes or any other of our obligations or indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  

Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.  

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.  

The accounting for convertible debt securities such as our Convertible Notes is subject to change that will result in a significant increase in the accrual of interest expense under those notes.  

The accounting for convertible debt securities such as our Convertible Notes is subject to frequent scrutiny by the accounting regulatory bodies and is subject to change. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). This FSP applies to convertible debt instruments (such as our Convertible Notes) that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133. As a result of the issuance of this FSP, the liability and equity components of our Convertible Notes must be separately accounted for in a manner that will reflect our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. The excess of the principal amount of the debt over the amount ultimately allocated to the liability component is required to be amortized to interest expense using the interest

 method. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As a result, we will adopt this standard at the beginning of fiscal 2010. This FSP must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The retrospective adoption of this FSP will increase our historical reported interest expense from December 10, 2007 (issuance date of the Convertible Notes) forward. Upon adoption, we expect to revise prior periods by reclassifying approximately $470.0 million of our Convertible Notes to additional paid-in capital, resulting in a debt discount. As a result, our fiscal 2008 non-cash interest expense will increase by approximately $48.2 million, resulting in a restated diluted loss per share of approximately $1.69 per share, net of tax. Future periods would be similarly affected by an amortization of the debt discount as an interest expense.  

Risks Related to our Common Stock and Convertible Notes  

Future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock and our Convertible Notes.  

Any future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our Convertible Notes, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares upon conversion of our Convertible Notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and our Convertible Notes. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.  

In addition, the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of our Convertible Notes, or any common stock that note holders receive upon conversion of their notes.  

Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of our Convertible Notes and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.  

Future sales of our common stock, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and the value of our Convertible Notes prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In addition, we may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options or for other reasons.  

Provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  

Our charter, bylaws and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.

Our stock price is volatile.  

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:  

       announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;  

       published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;  

       quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;  

       general conditions in the worldwide economy;  

       announcements of technological innovations;  

       new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and  

       developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers.  

The price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Notes. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of high-tech companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.  

Conversion of our Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes.  

To the extent we issue any shares of our common stock upon conversion of our Convertible Notes, the conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares of our common stock upon prior conversion of our Convertible Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of our Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.
