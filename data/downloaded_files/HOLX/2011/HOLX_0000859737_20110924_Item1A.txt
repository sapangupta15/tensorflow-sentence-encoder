Item 1A. Risk Factors  

This report contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Such statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.  

Risks Related to our Business  

The continuing worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding world financial markets and continuing weak worldwide macroeconomic conditions have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Additionally, constrictions in world credit markets have caused and may continue to cause our customers to experience increased difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products. Economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums and co-payments may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists, which in turn would adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. If the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.  

Sales and market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third party payors. The failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.  

Sales and market acceptance of our medical products and the treatments facilitated by our products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our products and treatments has and will continue to depend upon our customers ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from third-party payors for, these products and treatments. In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, known as CMS, establish coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Under current CMS policies, varying reimbursement levels have been established for our products and treatments. Coverage policies for Medicare patients may vary by regional Medicare carriers in the absence of a National Coverage Decision and reimbursement rates for treatments may vary based on the geographic price index. Coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payor decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by CMS. The use of our products and treatments outside the United States is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and private insurance carriers.  

In November 2011, CMS announced 2012 reimbursement rates for physician, hospital and ambulatory surgical center payments. For 2011, as part of US healthcare reform legislation, which was passed on March 23, 2010, reimbursement for bone density screening in 2010 and 2011 was adjusted to 70% of the 2006 rates. This resulted in an approximate increase of 60% of the rates published in the 2010 CMS Physician Fee Schedule. However, unless future legislation is adopted, the reimbursement for bone density screening will revert in 2012 to the prior CMS Physician Fee Schedule, which would result in an over 40% reduction in reimbursement for  

21  

Table of Contents 

 such screening, as compared to 2011 reimbursement rates. The CMS reimbursement rates for 2012 also include a general reduction of 27% in the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) factor. This factor is used by CMS in a formula to determine doctor reimbursements and, if implemented, would correspondingly affect the reimbursement for the use of our products. Congress has, from time to time, overridden some or all of the proposed reductions in reimbursement. However, we cannot assure that Congress will override any part of the recent proposed reductions. Significant reductions in reimbursement rates proposed or implemented for the use of any our products has had and may continue to have a material adverse affect on the sales of those products.  

CMS has not adopted a reimbursement rate for the use of 3D tomosynthesis, as tomosynthesis was only recently approved by the FDA in February 2011 in connection with our PMA application for our Dimensions system. We are working with governmental authorities, healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in our efforts to secure reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis. However, we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, adequate reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis would adversely affect sales of our Dimensions 3D systems.  

The adoption of healthcare reform in the United States and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of these reforms could harm our business and prospects.  

The healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. The effect of the implementation of the new U.S. health care reform law, adopted in March 2010, on our business is uncertain. Among other things, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices beginning in 2013. We expect that this excise tax will apply to our products. U.S. net product sales represented 76%, 79% and 80% of our worldwide net product sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The new law and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the excise tax will increase our costs of doing business. The impact of this law and these proposals could harm our business and prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition. Public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could:  

       limit the use of our products and treatments;  

       reduce reimbursement available for such use;  

       further tax the sale or use of our products; or  

       adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted.  

These reforms, cost containment measures and new taxes, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, result of operations, financial condition and prospects.  

Changes in laws affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  

We operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:  

       new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services;  

       changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and treatments and result in lost market opportunity;  

22  

Table of Contents 

       changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products and treatments to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or treatments, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; and  

       new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.  

We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.  

Guidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.  

Professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. Recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by healthcare providers and insurers could result in decreased use of our products. For example, during calendar 2009, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists changed their recommendations for cervical cancer screening, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed their recommendations for mammography screening, in each case, to recommend less frequent screening. On October 19, 2011, the USPSTF published draft guidelines for public comment on cervical cancer screening which may reduce the utilization of ThinPrep and / or Cervista due to recommending less frequent screening and not recommending HPV co-testing. All of these new recommendations, if implemented, could significantly reduce the amount of screening using our cervical cancer screening, mammography and related products and adversely affect the sale of those products. Moreover, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations, guidelines or studies will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.  

Our long-term success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and treatments and enhance our existing products and treatments.  

We are expending significant resources on our continuing research and development programs which are designed to develop new products and treatments and to enhance and improve our existing products and treatments. The successful development of our products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       unanticipated delays in development, clinical trials or the FDAs approval or clearance process;  

       access to capital;  

       budget overruns;  

       third party intellectual property;  

       technical problems; and  

       other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval applications for products or 510(k) clearance.  

Given the uncertainties inherent with product development, introduction, and enhancement our efforts may not be completed on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget, if at all, could harm our business and prospects.

If we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require, we may not be successful in developing and marketing those products.  

The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing our products in sufficient quantities. These difficulties have primarily related to delays and difficulties associated with ramping up production of newly introduced products and may lead to increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. Our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.  

Our business could be harmed if products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications.  

We are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. Our existing and newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity, mandatory or voluntary recall or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products may be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which could harm our business and prospects.  

The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of medical products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall could harm the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.  

We manufacture our products at a number of different facilities located throughout the world. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Our manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could harm our business and prospects. Because some of our manufacturing operations are located in Germany, Costa Rica and China, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described below.  

Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products and treatments or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products and treatments are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. Our delay or inability to obtain any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.

Medical devices cannot be marketed in the United States without clearance or approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect its safety or effectiveness require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civic sanctions, including but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties.  

Medical devices sold in the United States must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.  

The markets for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected.  

The successful commercialization of our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;  

       trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;  

       perceptions of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;  

       recommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers;  

       the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;  

       competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and  

       other technological developments.  

Often, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not addressed until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment.  

If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments our business and prospects could be harmed.  

The market for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system may not develop as expected.  

The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products may not continue to develop as expected. There is a significant installed base of conventional digital and screen-film mammography products in hospitals and radiological practices. The use of our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x-ray imaging equipment. As our  

25  

Table of Contents 

 Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis systems are generally more expensive than conventional mammography products, we believe that a major factor in the markets acceptance of Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis systems has been and will continue to be based upon the benefits of tomosynthesis as compared to less expensive technologies. Moreover, as a new technology, there is currently limited, if any, reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We believe that our ability to continue to gain market acceptance of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and follow-on products depends on our ability to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and to secure reimbursement to support the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We are seeking to work with healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in connection with our efforts to promote, and to secure reimbursement for, the use of 3D tomosynthesis. However, we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful. The market for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products has and will continue to be affected by published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of tomosynthesis, as well as decisions relating to the reimbursement of healthcare providers for the use of the system. The publication of an adverse study, or an adverse decision relating to the reimbursement of the use of tomosynthesis, would likely significantly impair the adoption of this technology and harm our business. Our sales of our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system may also be adversely affected by increased competition. Several companies, including Siemens, Giotto, Philips and Planmed, have recently introduced 3D tomosynthesis systems in certain foreign countries. We also are aware that other companies, several of which have substantially greater resources than we have, such as GE and Siemens, are developing 3D tomosynthesis systems for approval in the U.S. Because the markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products are relatively new, it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time.  

Our business may be harmed by our acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.  

We have acquired a number of businesses, technologies, product lines and products, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. The long-term success of our acquisitions and any additional acquisitions we may complete in the future will depend upon our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. We may fail to realize anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:  

       problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:  

       diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;  

       failure to retain and motivate key employees;  

       failure to successfully obtain FDA approval or clearance for products under development;  

       failure to successfully obtain approval or clearance for products in foreign countries;  

       failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;  

       failure of customers to accept new products;  

       failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;  

       failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;  

       failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;  

       potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;  

       potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems;  

       potential difficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the SEC; and  

26  

Table of Contents 

       potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition of such companies, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;  

       we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;  

       an acquisition may result in future impairment charges related to diminished fair value of businesses acquired as compared to the price we paid for them;  

       an acquisition may involve restructuring operations or reductions in workforce which may result in substantial charges to our operations;  

       an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;  

       an acquisition may involve significant deferred or contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources; and  

       the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax decisions and/or changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.  

Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from combining acquired businesses could harm our business and prospects and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  

If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or other obligations, or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition, and may be dilutive to our stockholders. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.  

Our business may be harmed by the contingent earnout obligations we incurred in connection with our acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.  

In connection with our acquisitions, we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earnout payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period. We also expect that acquisitions we may complete in the future may contain contingent earnout payments, and these payments could be significant. In certain circumstances, such as a change of control, a portion of these obligations may be accelerated. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earnout obligations may include covenants to operate the businesses acquired in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us. These provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the business acquired. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. Our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances giving rise to the payment and our previous estimates, all or a portion of these payments may be required to be expensed by us when accrued. For example, our contingent earnout obligations payable in connection with the TCT and Healthcome acquisitions will be fully expensed as accrued because our obligation to make these payments have been conditioned on the continued employment of certain key employees of TCT and Healthcome. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds to pay our contingent obligations when due, or that such obligations, including the associated covenants relating to the operation of the acquired business, will not otherwise adversely affect our business, liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving growth.  

Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our growth, including:  

       expanding our product offerings;  

       allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;  

       developing new applications for our technologies;  

       strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;  

       acquiring technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services;  

       implementing targeted customer initiatives; and  

       supporting cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings.  

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business.  

Our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could harm our business and prospects.  

Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, acquisitions in foreign countries may be more difficult to complete, integrate and operate and could adversely affect our business.  

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could harm our business and prospects.  

The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition and continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, we are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of the ThinPrep System and our molecular diagnostic products. Due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest United States laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories.

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.  

We have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, and copyrights to protect our products and technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe our intellectual property, copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. In addition, we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. The rights provided by a patent are finite in time. Over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the U.S. and abroad thus allowing third parties to utilize certain of our technologies. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the U.S. Even if we believed our proprietary information is protected by patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. As a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.  

Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.  

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. We have been involved in patent litigation, and may in the future be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. For further information concerning such ongoing litigation, please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  

In connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.  

Our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.  

We are subject to a number of additional risks and expenses due to our international operations, including our acquired businesses in China. Any of these risks or expenses could harm our operating results. These risks and expenses include:  

       difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;  

       protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;  

       difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection;  

       difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;  

       expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;  

       possible adverse tax consequences;  

29  

Table of Contents 

       the inability to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements;  

       the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;  

       governmental currency controls;  

       multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements, international trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);  

       reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  

       political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;  

       the inability to effectively obtain or enforce intellectual property rights and otherwise protect against clone or knock off products, and;  

       the lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in China and other foreign countries.  

We utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.  

We have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products, principally in foreign countries. If these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected.  

Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.  

We maintain sales and service offices outside the United States, have manufacturing facilities in Germany, Costa Rica, Canada and China and conduct business worldwide. The expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies, except at our Costa Rica subsidiary, where the majority of business is conducted in U.S. dollars. Our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the Euro or U.S. dollar. Historically, a majority of our sales of capital equipment to international dealers have been denominated in U.S. dollars; however in the second half of fiscal 2010 we began to invoice more of our European sales in the Euro.  

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency. In the last few years we have not hedged foreign currency exposures, but we may in the future hedge foreign currency denominated sales. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. This reliance could harm our business and prospects.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. Any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales.

We face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.  

A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. Some of our competitors are large companies that may enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including:  

       significantly greater name recognition;  

       established, or larger, distribution networks;  

       additional product lines, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;  

       higher levels of automation and more substantial installed bases of such equipment;  

       more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and financial capabilities; and  

       greater financial resources allowing them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.  

The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Other companies may develop products that are superior to or less expensive, or both, than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introductions of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.  

If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.  

Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.  

The markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. These trends will likely continue into the foreseeable future. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance. If we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.  

Our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation.  

Our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:  

       the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;  

       the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;  

       the development status and demand for our products;  

       the development status and demand for therapies to treat the health concerns addressed by our products and treatments;  

       economic conditions in our markets;  

       foreign exchange rates;  

       the timing of orders;  

       the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;  

       the mix of products we sell and markets we serve;  

31  

Table of Contents 

       regulatory approval of products;  

       the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       pricing and other competitive conditions;  

       unanticipated expenses;  

       complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP);  

       asset impairments; and  

       seasonality of sales of certain of our products.  

Customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.  

Recent changes to reclassify full-field digital mammography to permit 510(k) clearance could increase competition for our digital mammography products.  

The FDA has down-classified 2D digital mammography systems from Class III to Class II. As a result, these systems will require a 510(k) submission rather than a PMA, which will make it easier for other mammography vendors to gain approval in the United States. We anticipate that competition in the digital mammography market will intensify as more companies and products enter this market.  

Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false or fraudulent claims.  

We are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. Similarly, our international operations are subject to the provisions of the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices is ever evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects. Moreover, our failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.  

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.  

In the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business  

32  

Table of Contents 

 partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor, or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any such compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could adversely affect our business.  

We are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products.  

Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that products competitive position in the market.  

The sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, inaccurate test results or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of managements attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, and could harm our business and prospects.  

We use hazardous materials and products.  

Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. We are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.  

We may incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage.   

Our insurance coverage includes product liability, property, fire, terrorism and business interruption policies. Our insurance coverage contains policy limits, specifications and exclusions. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. Nonetheless, we may incur losses of a type for which we are not covered by insurance or which exceed the limits of liability of our insurance policies. In that event, we could experience a significant loss which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition.  

Our future success depends on the continued services of key personnel.  

The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or  

33  

Table of Contents 

 strategic objectives. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel, particularly software engineers and other technical personnel, is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.  

Our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects.  

We have entered into alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships. Alliances with certain partners or companies could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Moreover, we may not be able to:  

       identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures;  

       assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated;  

       successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us; or  

       successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.  

Furthermore, any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture, failing to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively, or failing to comply with obligations in connection therewith, could harm our business and prospects.  

An adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate, including the continuation of the current financial and economic uncertainty, could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.  

At least annually, we review the carrying value of our goodwill, and for other long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. Conditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate an evaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. In addition, the deterioration of a companys market capitalization significantly below its net book value is an indicator of impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. As a result of this assessment, we recorded significant impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal 2009 and 2010. For further information of these charges, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for our reporting units, and no additional impairment charges were required. Although we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. It is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic uncertainty could negatively affect our anticipated future cash flows, or the discount rates used to value the cash flows for each reporting unit, to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test in fiscal 2012. We have ongoing litigation with Conceptus regarding potential patent infringement of a Conceptus patent by our Adiana system. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Conceptus and awarded Conceptus $18.8 million in damages. Post trial motions will be filed addressing certain issues that could impact the ultimate outcome of this case. We also expect that Conceptus will seek to enjoin us from further sales of the Adiana system. A hearing on the post trial motions and injunctions request is scheduled for December 22, 2011. The jury verdict and any such determinations are subject to appeal by either party. If Conceptus is successful in upholding the verdict, we may be required to remove the Adiana system from the market. The jury verdict and subsequent litigation status may be an indicator of impairment for our GYN Surgical reporting unit. A reduction in the anticipated future cash flows of our GYN  

34  

Table of Contents 

 Surgical reporting unit could result in a material impairment charge that would have an adverse impact on our operating results. We will further evaluate this matter in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis and a long-lived asset impairment analysis, if required.  

Our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.  

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We take certain income tax positions on our tax returns that we provide additional taxes if it is more likely than not they will not withstand challenge by tax authorities. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, including the United States, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly evaluate the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and tax reserves. However, we cannot assure that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, our effective tax rate may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. There are several proposals to reform U.S. tax rules being considered by U.S. law makers, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated earnings, potentially requiring those earnings to be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate, reduce or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. Our future reported financial results may be adversely affected by tax rule changes which restrict or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits or deduct expenses attributable to foreign earnings, or otherwise affect the treatment of our unrepatriated earnings.  

Risks Related to our Indebtedness  

We have incurred significant indebtedness that may limit our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.  

On December 10, 2007, we issued $1.725 billion of 2.00% convertible notes due 2037, which are unsecured and subordinated to our secured indebtedness. On November 18, 2010, we entered into separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements under which we retired $450.0 million in aggregate principal of our Original Notes for $450.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% Convertible Exchange Senior Notes due 2037. Following these transactions, $1.275 billion in principal amount of the Original Notes remain outstanding. Our level of indebtedness may:  

       make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;  

       increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;  

       require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;  

       limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  

       place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  

       limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.  

If there were an event of default under our convertible notes or a change of control, the holders of the notes may be permitted to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately  

35  

Table of Contents 

 and may be cross-defaulted to other debt or obligations. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our convertible notes, and related deferred tax liabilities, when due or if accelerated upon an event of default, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on that debt.  

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our obligations.  

Our ability to make payments on our convertible notes, and related deferred tax liabilities, or any other of our obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. At final maturity of our convertible notes or in the event of acceleration of our convertible notes following an event of default, the entire outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes will become due and payable. In addition, each holder of our original convertible notes (aggregate principal amount of $1.275 billion) may require us to repurchase such holders notes on December 13, 2013, and each of December 15, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 or upon a fundamental change, including a change of control, and each holder of our exchange convertible notes (aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million) may require us to repurchase such holders notes on December 15, 2016, and on each of December 15, 2020, December 15, 2025, December 13, 2030 and December 14, 2035 or upon a fundamental change. In each such case, the repurchase price would be equal to 100% of the notes accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to make the required payments or repurchases of any of our convertible notes, it would likely constitute an event of default under all the convertible notes.  

Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or other obligations as such indebtedness or other obligations mature or otherwise become due and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to implement one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.  

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.  

Risks Related to our Common Stock and Convertible Notes  

Future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes.  

Any future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.  

In addition, the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of our convertible notes, or any common stock that note holders receive upon conversion of their notes.  

36  

Table of Contents 

Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.  

Future sales of our common stock, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In addition, we may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options or for other reasons.  

Provisions in our charter, bylaws and stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  

Our charter, bylaws and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.  

Our stock price is volatile.  

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:  

       new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;  

       announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;  

       published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;  

       quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;  

       general conditions in the worldwide economy;  

       announcements of technological innovations;  

       new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;  

       developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;  

       the implementation of healthcare reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future, and;  

       the success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions.  

The price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Notes. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of high-tech companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.
