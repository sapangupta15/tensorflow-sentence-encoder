CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

2009 vs. 2008  

Revenues for the year decreased 4%, or $1.7 billion, to $36.1 billion; net income decreased 25%, or $1.1 billion, to $3.3 billion; and diluted earnings per share decreased 23% to $1.76.  

Net income for the current year included certain items that affected comparability, including restructuring and impairment charges ($0.17 per diluted share), a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and AETN ($0.08 per diluted share) and a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($0.04 per diluted share). Including the impact of rounding, these items collectively resulted in a net adverse impact of $0.06 per diluted share. Fiscal 2008 included an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America and a gain on the sale of movies.com (together $0.01 per diluted share), the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters ($0.03 per diluted share), a bad debt charge for a receivable from Lehman Brothers ($0.03 per diluted share) and an impairment charge ($0.01 per diluted share). These items collectively had no net impact on earnings per share. The current year results also include the benefit from one additional week of operations compared to fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 due to the timing of our fiscal period end. Fiscal 2010 will not include an additional week and will be a fifty-two week fiscal year.  

The decrease in diluted earnings per share reflected lower operating results and the items discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding. The decrease in operating results was primarily due to lower broadcast and cable advertising revenues, a decline in worldwide sales of DVD units, decreased guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts and Disneyland Paris, higher programming costs and production cost amortization at our cable and broadcast businesses, lower performance of our movies in worldwide theatrical and television distribution and lower earned revenue at our licensing business. These decreases were partially offset by contractual rate increases on revenues from MVSPs (Affiliate Fees), principally at ESPN, cost mitigation activities at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris and higher international and domestic sales of ABC Studios productions.  

2008 vs. 2007  

Revenues for the year increased 7%, or $2.3 billion, to $37.8 billion; net income decreased 6%, or $260 million, to $4.4 billion; and diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $2.28.  

As discussed above, net income for fiscal 2008 included certain items which affected comparability. Fiscal 2007 included gains from the sales of E! Entertainment and Us Weekly (together $0.31 per diluted share), the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters ($0.03 per diluted share), income from the discontinued operations of the ABC Radio business ($0.01 per diluted share), an equity-based compensation plan modification charge ($0.01 per diluted share) and an impairment charge ($0.01 per diluted share). These items collectively resulted in a net benefit of $0.33 per diluted share.  

30  

Table of Contents 

The increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008 was the result of an increase in segment operating results and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by the absence of the gains in fiscal 2007 discussed above. Higher segment operating results reflected increases in Affiliate Fees and advertising revenues at our cable businesses, higher guest spending and attendance at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris, and strong sales of licensed products, partially offset by a decline in worldwide DVD sales.  

Restructuring and Impairment Charges  

The Company recorded charges totaling $492 million for the current year which included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213 million. The most significant of the impairment charges were $142 million related to FCC radio licenses and $65 million related to our investment in UTV Software Communications Limited (UTV). The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result of various ongoing organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses. Restructuring and impairment charges for the prior year consisted of an impairment charge of $39 million related to FCC radio licenses.  

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income (expense) is as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  On September 15, 2009, the Company and Hearst both contributed their 50% interest in Lifetime to AETN in exchange for an increased interest in AETN. The transaction resulted in a $228 million non-cash gain. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of this transaction.  

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2009 vs. 2008  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Segment operating income includes equity in the income of investees. In the Business Segment results discussion, equity in the income of investees is included in segment operating income but does not affect segment revenues or costs and expenses.

Table of Contents 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Companys portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The following table reconciles segment operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The fiscal 2008 and 2007 amounts consist of impairment charges for FCC radio licenses which were previously reported in Media Networks operating income in the fiscal 2008 and 2007 financial statements. For the fiscal 2009 financial statements, these amounts have been reclassified to Restructuring and Impairment Charges in the consolidated statements of income to conform to the fiscal 2009 presentation.  

Media Networks  

The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenues  

Media Networks revenues increased 2%, or $352 million, to $16.2 billion, consisting of a 5% increase, or $514 million, at the Cable Networks offset by a 3% decrease, or $162 million, at Broadcasting.  

Increased Cable Networks revenues were primarily due to growth of $614 million from Affiliate Fees, partially offset by a decrease of $149 million from advertising revenues. Affiliate Fees are generally derived from fees charged on a per-subscriber basis, and the increase in the current year was primarily due to contractual rate increases at ESPN and, to a lesser extent, at the domestic Disney Channel and ABC Family, the impact of the additional week of  

32  

Table of Contents 

 operations and subscriber growth at ESPN. Lower advertising revenue reflected a decrease at ESPN, partially offset by an increase at ABC Family. The decrease at ESPN reflected fewer units sold, partially offset by higher rates. The increase at ABC Family reflected increased units sold and higher rates. Higher Affiliate Fees at the domestic Disney Channel were more than offset by lower DVD sales.  

Certain of the Companys contracts with cable and satellite operators include annual live programming commitments. In these cases, recognition of revenues subject to the commitments is deferred until the annual commitments are satisfied, which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year.  

Decreased Broadcasting revenues were primarily due to lower advertising sales at the ABC Television Network and at the owned television stations, partially offset by higher international and domestic sales of ABC Studios productions driven by Greys Anatomy, Private Practice, and Criminal Minds. Lower advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network reflected lower primetime ratings.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses, which consist primarily of programming rights costs, production costs, participation costs, distribution and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs, increased 5%, or $539 million, to $12.0 billion, consisting of a 6% increase, or $367 million, at the Cable Networks and a 3% increase, or $172 million, at Broadcasting. The increase at Cable Networks was driven by higher rights costs at ESPN due to contractual rate increases for key contracts and costs of new and renewed contracts for college and international sports programming and increased programming costs at ABC Family due to more original series. The increase at Broadcasting was driven by higher programming and production costs and a bad debt charge in connection with a bankruptcy of a syndication customer. Higher programming and production costs reflected more hours of original scripted primetime programming at the ABC Television Network and higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC Studios productions.  

Sports Programming Costs  

The Company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of rights for multi-year sports programming packages, including the National Football League, college football (including college bowl games) and basketball conferences, National Basketball Association, NASCAR, Major League Baseball, World Cup and various soccer leagues, and Golf and Tennis Associations. The costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years. We enter into these contractual commitments with the expectation that, over the life of the contracts, revenue from advertising during the programming and Affiliate Fees will exceed the costs of the programming. While contract costs may initially exceed incremental revenues and negatively impact operating income, it is our expectation that the combined value to our networks from all of these contracts will result in long-term benefits. The actual impact of these contracts on the Companys results over the term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income decreased 4%, or $216 million, to $4.8 billion for the year due to a decrease of $337 million at Broadcasting, partially offset by an increase of $121 million at the Cable Networks. The decrease at Broadcasting was primarily due to lower advertising sales, higher programming costs and the syndication customer bad debt charge, partially offset by increased sales of ABC Studios productions. The increase at the Cable Networks was primarily due to growth at ESPN and ABC Family.  

Parks and Resorts  

Revenues  

Parks and Resorts revenues decreased 7%, or $837 million, to $10.7 billion due to decreases of $531 million at our domestic operations and $306 million at our international operations.

Table of Contents 

The following table presents attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics for our domestic properties:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.  

At our domestic operations, decreased revenue reflected a decrease in guest spending, principally at our parks and resorts, and lower gains on securitized sales of ownership interests at Disney Vacation Club. Decreased guest spending at the domestic parks and resorts reflected lower average ticket prices, lower average daily hotel room rates and decreased merchandise spending. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue recognition at Disney Vacation Club in connection with the completion of a vacation club property.  

At our international operations, lower revenues resulted from a decrease at Disneyland Paris due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and decreased guest spending. Decreased guest spending was due to lower average ticket prices, decreased merchandise spending and lower average daily hotel room rates.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses, which consist primarily of labor, depreciation, costs of merchandise, food and beverage sold, marketing and sales expense, repairs and maintenance and entertainment, decreased 4%, or $358 million. The decrease in costs and expenses was driven by decreases at Disneyland Paris and the Walt Disney World Resort, partially offset by an increase at Disney Vacation Club. The decrease at Disneyland Paris was due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and savings from cost mitigation activities partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. The decrease at the Walt Disney World Resort was driven by savings from cost mitigation activities, partially offset by labor and other cost inflation. The increase at Disney Vacation Club was driven by higher per unit cost of sales and expense recognition in connection with the completion of a vacation club property.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income decreased 25%, or $479 million, to $1.4 billion, due to decreases at our domestic operations and at Disneyland Paris.  

Studio Entertainment  

Revenues   

Revenues decreased 16%, or $1.2 billion, to $6.1 billion primarily due to decreases of $978 million in worldwide home entertainment, $129 million in music distribution and $106 million in worldwide television distribution.  

The decrease in worldwide home entertainment revenues was primarily due to lower unit sales and net effective pricing, reflecting the overall decline in the DVD market and the strength of Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End in the prior year. Significant other titles included WALL-E and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian in the current year while the prior year included Ratatouille, National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets and Enchanted.  

34  

Table of Contents 

Lower revenues in music distribution reflected the strong performance of the Hannah Montana concert tour and Miley Cyrus and Jonas Brothers CD titles in the prior year. The decrease in worldwide television distribution was driven by fewer significant titles in the current year.  

Cost and Expenses  

Costs and expenses, which consist primarily of production cost amortization, distribution and marketing expenses, product costs and participation costs decreased 5%, or $305 million, primarily due to decreases in worldwide home entertainment and music distribution, partially offset by an increase in worldwide theatrical distribution.  

The decrease in costs at worldwide home entertainment was primarily due to lower distribution costs and production cost amortization resulting from a decline in DVD unit sales. The decrease in music distribution reflected the absence of costs associated with the Hannah Montana concert tour in the prior year. Increased costs and expenses in worldwide theatrical distribution reflected higher marketing costs for current year releases and higher film cost write-downs.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income decreased 84%, or $911 million, to $175 million primarily due to decreases at worldwide home entertainment, worldwide theatrical distribution and worldwide television distribution.  

Consumer Products  

Revenues  

Revenues were essentially flat at $2.4 billion as an increase of $131 million at our retail business was offset by decreases of $86 million at Merchandise Licensing and $44 million at Publishing. The increase at our retail business was primarily due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 (see discussion of the Disney Stores acquisition below), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation at The Disney Stores Europe as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Euro. The decrease at Merchandise Licensing was primarily due to lower earned royalty revenue across multiple product categories due to the difficult retail environment as well as the strength of Hannah Montana and High School Musical properties in the prior year. The decrease at Publishing reflected lower magazine sales driven by the closure of Wondertime magazine.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses, which consist primarily of cost of sales, salaries and benefits, marketing and occupancy, increased 11%, or $181 million, to $1.8 billion primarily due to an increase at our retail business, partially offset by a decrease at Publishing. The increase at retail was due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency translation at The Disney Stores Europe as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Euro. The decrease at Publishing reflected lower cost of sales and other operating costs.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income decreased 22%, or $169 million, to $609 million due to lower results at Merchandise Licensing and at our retail business, which reflected the adverse impact of a full year of company-owned operations at the Disney Stores North America in fiscal 2009 whereas the prior year included five months of company-owned operations and seven months of licensed operations.  

Disney Stores Acquisition  

On April 30, 2008, the Company acquired certain assets of the Disney Stores North America for approximately $64 million of cash from, and terminated its long-term licensing arrangement for the Disney Stores with, The Childrens Place, the former licensee. The Company acquired the inventory, leasehold improvements, and certain fixed assets of, and assumed the leases on, 229 stores. The Company conducted the wind-down and closure of an additional 88 stores but did not assume the leases on these stores.

Table of Contents 

Interactive Media  

Revenues  

Interactive Media revenues decreased 1%, or $7 million, to $712 million primarily due to a decrease of $58 million at Disney Interactive Studios, driven by lower sales of self-published video games and decreased licensing revenues, partially offset by increases of $39 million at our mobile phone service business in Japan, which was launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and $11 million at Disney Online driven by increased subscription revenues at Club Penguin.  

At Disney Interactive Studios, lower self-published video games sales reflected decreased net effective pricing and unit sales. Significant current year titles included High School Musical 3, Sing It and Bolt as compared to the prior year, which included High School Musical, Turok, Hannah Montana 2 and Pure. The decrease in licensing revenues was primarily due to the performance of WALL-E, Cars and Ratatouille in the prior year.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses, which consist primarily of video game and internet product development costs, cost of sales, distribution and marketing expenses, general and administrative costs, and technology infrastructure costs, increased 4%, or $35 million, to $1.0 billion.  

The increase was primarily due to higher unit cost of sales and distribution costs, which included the costs for bundled accessories and music royalties for certain current-year titles at Disney Interactive Studios, higher expenses at our mobile phone service business in Japan driven by a full year of operations, partially offset by a decrease at Disney Online driven by lower marketing costs.  

Segment Operating Loss  

Segment operating loss increased 14%, or $37 million, to $295 million driven by lower results at Disney Interactive Studio partially offset by improved results at Disney Online.  

NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2009 vs. 2008  

Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses  

Corporate and unallocated shared expense decreased 13%, from $460 million to $398 million, driven by savings from cost mitigation activities and an increase in allocation of costs to the business segments.  

Net Interest Expense  

Net interest expense is detailed below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense and interest and investment income for the year was driven by lower effective interest rates.  

Effective Income Tax Rate  

The effective tax rate was comparable to the prior year at 36.2% as the favorable impact of legislative changes in the current year was offset by the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters in the prior year.  

Minority Interests  

Minority interest expense was flat at $302 million for the current year as the impact of lower financing costs at Hong Kong Disneyland and improved operating results at ESPN were offset by lower performance at Disneyland Paris. The minority interest is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS  

Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all five segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $214 million, $255 million and $278 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.  

We expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $268 million to $482 million in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations and asset returns that were below the assumed return. The decrease in the discount rate and the asset return shortfall versus our expected return in fiscal 2009 also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense which totals $2.8 billion ($1.8 billion after-tax) as of October 3, 2009. If our investment performance does not improve relative to our long-term assumption and/or discount rates do not increase, we expect that pension and post-retirement medical costs will continue to be considerably higher than fiscal 2009 for the next few years as a result of amortizing these unrecognized expenses. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements. During fiscal 2009, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans totaling $473 million, which included discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company expects pension and post-retirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2010 to range from $350 million to $450 million, which is expected to include discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2010 will be determined based on our January 1, 2010 funding actuarial valuation which will be available late fiscal 2010. See Item 1A  Risk Factors for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.  

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2008 vs. 2007  

Media Networks  

Revenues  

Media Networks revenues increased 6%, or $944 million, to $15.9 billion, consisting of a 10% increase, or $874 million, at the Cable Networks and a 1% increase, or $70 million, at Broadcasting.  

Increased Cable Networks revenues were primarily due to growth of $654 million from Affiliate Fees and $206 million from advertising revenues. Increased Affilitate Fees in fiscal 2008 were driven by increases at ESPN and, to a lesser extent, the worldwide Disney Channels and ABC Family. The increase at ESPN was primarily due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth, the increase at the worldwide Disney Channels was driven by subscriber growth and the increase at ABC Family was due to contractual rate increases. Higher advertising revenues at ESPN and ABC Family reflected improved rates and ratings. Higher DVD sales, primarily High School Musical, were partially offset by the favorable settlement of a claim with an international distributor in fiscal 2007.  

Increased Broadcasting revenues reflected higher international sales of ABC Studios productions partially offset by decreased advertising revenues, largely at the owned television stations. Increased international sales of ABC Studios productions were driven by Greys Anatomy, Private Practice and Reaper. Fiscal 2008 revenues at the ABC Television Network were comparable to fiscal 2007 as the impact of lower ratings was offset by higher advertising rates and digital media revenues.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses increased 6%, or $609 million, to $11.5 billion, consisting of an 7% increase, or $448 million, at the Cable Networks and a 3% increase, or $161 million, at Broadcasting. The increase at Cable Networks was primarily due to increased costs at ESPN and to a lesser extent, the worldwide Disney Channels, driven by higher programming, administrative and marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by the absence of Major League Baseball programming costs at ABC Family. The increase at Broadcasting was primarily due to higher production cost amortization related to international sales of our programs.  

37  

Table of Contents 

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 10%, or $447 million, to $5.0 billion due to an increase of $536 million at the Cable Networks partially offset by a decrease of $89 million at Broadcasting. The increase at the Cable Networks was primarily due to growth at ESPN, higher income at our cable equity investments, and increases at ABC Family and the domestic Disney Channels, partially offset by a favorable settlement of a claim with an international distributor in fiscal 2007. The decrease at Broadcasting was due to lower advertising revenues at the owned television stations. The increase in income at our cable equity investments was primarily due to higher affiliate and advertising revenue at Lifetime and a gain on the sale of a European cable channel.  

ABC Radio Transaction  

On June 12, 2007, the Company completed the spin-off of its wholly-owned subsidiary, ABC Radio Holdings, Inc., which was then merged into a subsidiary of Citadel Broadcasting Corporation (Citadel). Prior to the spin-off, the Company consolidated its ABC Radio business, consisting of 22 large-market radio stations and the ABC Radio Network businesses, under ABC Radio Holdings, Inc. The transaction did not include the Companys ESPN Radio or Radio Disney network and station businesses. The results of the ABC Radio business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company now includes the ESPN Radio and Radio Disney network and stations businesses with Cable Networks in the Media Networks segment. Prior to the transaction, the Companys radio businesses were included with Broadcasting in the Media Networks segment. Previously reported results have been reclassified to reflect this presentation.  

Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows (in millions, except per share data):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Parks and Resorts  

Revenues  

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 8%, or $878 million, to $11.5 billion due to increases of $439 million at our domestic operations and $439 million at our international operations.  

The following table presents attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics for our domestic properties:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

38  

Table of Contents 

At our domestic operations, growth in revenues was primarily due to increases at the Walt Disney World Resort and Disney Vacation Club. Revenue growth at Walt Disney World Resort was primarily due to increased guest spending and theme park attendance. Increased guest spending was due to higher average ticket prices, increased food and beverage sales and higher average daily hotel room rates. At Disney Vacation Club, revenue growth reflected higher vacation club ownership sales, including extensions of the term of ownership on existing vacation club properties.  

At our international operations, revenue growth resulted from an increase at Disneyland Paris due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and increased guest spending and theme park attendance. Increased guest spending was due to higher average daily hotel room rates and average ticket prices.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses increased 8%, or $691 million, primarily due to increases at Disneyland Paris, Walt Disney World Resort and Disney Vacation Club. The increase at Disneyland Paris was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, labor cost inflation and higher volume-related costs. The increase at the Walt Disney World Resort was due to labor and other cost inflation, new guest offerings and volume-related costs. The increase at Disney Vacation Club was driven by higher per unit cost of sales.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 11%, or $187 million, to $1.9 billion, primarily due to increases at Disneyland Paris and the Walt Disney World Resort.  

Studio Entertainment  

Revenues  

Revenues decreased 2%, or $143 million, to $7.3 billion primarily due to decreases of $117 million in worldwide television distribution, $112 million in domestic theatrical distribution, and $66 million in domestic home entertainment, partially offset by an increase of $147 million in international home entertainment.  

The decrease in worldwide television distribution revenues was driven by the absence of the multi-season sale of Home Improvement which occurred in fiscal 2007. Lower revenues in domestic theatrical distribution reflected the strong performance of fiscal 2007 titles, including Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Ratatouille, and Wild Hogs, compared to the titles in fiscal 2008, which included National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets and WALL-E. Lower revenues in domestic home entertainment were primarily due to a decline in unit sales reflecting the performance of Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End and Ratatouille in fiscal 2008 compared to Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest and Cars in fiscal 2007.  

Revenue growth in international home entertainment was primarily due to a higher unit sales mix of television series DVD sets, which have higher average unit sales prices.  

Cost and Expenses  

Costs and expenses for fiscal 2008 were comparable to fiscal 2007 as decreases in worldwide television distribution and domestic theatrical distribution were largely offset by an increase in international home entertainment.  

Lower costs and expenses in worldwide television distribution were primarily due to a decrease in amortization and participation costs driven by the absence of the Home Improvement sale. The decrease in domestic theatrical distribution was primarily due to lower amortization expense reflecting decreased revenues for fiscal 2008 releases and lower film cost write-downs. The increase in international home entertainment was primarily due to higher distribution costs driven by extensive marketing campaigns in fiscal 2008.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income decreased 9%, or $109 million, to $1.1 billion primarily due to lower revenues in domestic home entertainment.

Consumer Products  

Revenues  

Revenues increased 21%, or $425 million, to $2.4 billion, due to increases of $196 million at our retail business and $181 million at Merchandise Licensing.  

The increase at our retail business was due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The revenue growth at Merchandise Licensing was primarily due to higher earned royalties across multiple product categories, led by Hannah Montana and High School Musical merchandise, partially offset by lower recognition of minimum guarantee revenues.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses increased 26%, or $336 million, to $1.6 billion primarily due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and higher salary and benefits expenses and increased participation costs at Merchandise Licensing.  

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income increased 13%, or $89 million, to $778 million due to growth at Merchandise Licensing, partially offset by a decrease at our retail business.  

Interactive Media  

Revenues  

Interactive Media revenues increased 47%, or $229 million, to $719 million primarily due to increases of $160 million at Disney Interactive Studios and $71 million at Disney Online.  

The increase at Disney Interactive Studios was primarily due to the performance of new High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Turok self-published video games in fiscal 2008 compared to Pirates of the Caribbean, Spectrobes and Meet the Robinsons games in fiscal 2007. The increase at Disney Online reflected higher virtual world subscription revenue due to a full year of Club Penguin, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  

Costs and Expenses  

Costs and expenses increased 25%, or $193 million, to $974 million driven by increases at Disney Interactive Studios and Disney Online, partially offset by lower costs related to the domestic mobile phone service, which was shut down in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase at Disney Interactive Studios reflected higher product, distribution and marketing costs associated with volume growth and increased investment in video game development. At Disney Online the increase was driven by higher development and marketing costs related to the Disney.com website and virtual worlds, including the impact of a full year of Club Penguin, and the Family.com website.  

Segment Operating Loss  

Segment operating loss decreased 11%, or $33 million, to $258 million driven by reduced costs due to the shutdown of the domestic mobile phone service in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, partially offset by higher marketing costs at Disney Online.

Net Interest Expense  

Net interest expense is detailed below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net interest expense decreased 12% for the year driven by lower effective interest rates and a gain on the sale of an investment, partially offset by higher average debt balances.  

Effective Income Tax Rate  

The effective income tax rate decreased 1.1 percentage points from 37.2% in 2007 to 36.1% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate for the year was primarily due to increased benefits from Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 199 related to qualified domestic production activities.  

Minority Interests  

Minority interest expense increased from $177 million to $302 million reflecting the impact of improved results at Disneyland Paris, ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland. The minority interest is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities  

Cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2009 decreased 7% or $382 million to $5.1 billion as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was driven by lower segment operating results and higher contributions to our pension plans, partially offset by lower income tax payments and a decreased net investment in working capital.  

Cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2008 increased 1% or $48 million to $5.4 billion as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was driven by higher segment operating results and lower pension contributions, partially offset by increased film and television spending and higher net investment in working capital including higher spending on Disney Vacation Club properties.

Depreciation expense from continuing operations is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Companys Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Companys broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.  

The Companys film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

Investing Activities  

Investing activities from continuing operations consist principally of investments in parks, resorts, and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Companys investments in parks, resorts and other property from continuing operations for the last three years are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new rides and attractions, cruise ships, recurring capital and capital improvements. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2009 reflected spending on Disneys California Adventure expansion and construction progress payments on two new cruise ships. The decrease in capital expenditures at international parks and resorts in fiscal 2008 reflected lower expenditures at Disneyland Paris as a result of completion of projects related to a multi-year investment program established with the 2005 Financial Restructuring (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  

Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities. The increase in fiscal 2008 was driven by the construction of new production and television station facilities.  

Other Investing Activities  

During fiscal 2009, acquisitions totaled $517 million and included the purchase of additional interests in Jetix Europe N.V. and UTV (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by proceeds totaling $185 million from the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America.  

During fiscal 2008, acquisitions totaled $660 million which included an additional interest in UTV.  

During fiscal 2007, the Company received $1.5 billion in proceeds from the sales of our interests in E! Entertainment Television and Us Weekly. Acquisitions totaled $608 million driven by Club Penguin Entertainment, Inc. and NASN Limited (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  

Financing Activities  

Cash used in continuing financing activities decreased by $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2009 and consisted of repayments of borrowings, the payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. The decrease from fiscal 2008 was due to lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher repayments of borrowings and decreased proceeds from stock option exercises. Cash used in continuing financing activities during fiscal 2008 and 2007 of $4.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, consisted of share repurchases and dividends, partially offset by borrowings and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Borrowings during fiscal 2007 included $1.35 billion of pre-spin-off borrowings of ABC Radio Holdings, Inc. that were removed from the Companys balance sheet in connection with the spin-off.

During the year ended October 3, 2009, the Companys borrowing activity was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.  

 (2)  The other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.  

 (3)  The other activity is due to the conversion of the HKSARs loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  

The Companys bank facilities are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Companys public debt rating and can range from 0.175% to 0.75%. As of October 3, 2009, the Company had not borrowed under these bank facilities. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in 2011, which if utilized, reduces available borrowing under this facility. As of October 3, 2009, $326 million of letters of credit had been issued of which $237 million was issued under this facility.  

The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities (see above), in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.  

As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2009. The Company paid a $648 million dividend ($0.35 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to fiscal 2008. The Company paid a $664 million dividend ($0.35 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 related to fiscal 2007; and paid a $637 million dividend ($0.31 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 related to fiscal 2006.  

During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of Disney common stock for $138 million. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased 139 million shares of Disney common stock for $4.5 billion. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 202 million shares of Disney common stock for $6.9 billion. As of October 3, 2009, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 179 million additional shares. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

We believe that the Companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See Item 1A  Risk Factors. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of December 2, 2009, Moodys Investors Services long and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard & Poors long and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with CreditWatch negative; and Fitchs long and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 3, 2009, by a significant margin. The Companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, from any representations, covenants or events of default.  

Euro Disney has covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investment and financing activities and require it to meet certain annual financial performance covenants. Subject to final third-party review as provided in its debt agreements, Euro Disney believes that it has complied with its financial performance covenants for fiscal year 2009.  

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

The Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.  

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at October 3, 2009 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $291 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. Amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt, and on current interest rates for variable rate debt.

 (2)  Other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for the construction of two new cruise ships, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports personnel, television and radio personalities and executives.  

 (3)  Contractual commitments include the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees  

The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.  

Legal and Tax Matters  

As disclosed in Notes 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters.  

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Film and Television Revenues and Costs  

We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, we include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.  

With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g. the home video or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a films release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.  

With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the programs rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Companys ability to generate advertising  

46  

Table of Contents 

 revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.  

We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. Rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to Ultimate Revenues (the Projected Revenue Method) or on a straight-line basis over the contract period, as appropriate. Revenues include both advertising revenues and an allocation of Affiliate Fees. If the annual contractual payments related to each season over the term of a multi-year sports programming arrangement approximate each seasons rights cost based on the Projected Revenue Method, we expense the related annual payments during the applicable season. If Ultimate Revenues change significantly from projections, amortization of the rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.  

Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are early morning, daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.  

Revenue Recognition  

The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate for the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.  

We reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.  

Revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.  

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions  

The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.  

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension  

47  

Table of Contents 

 expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 5.75% at the end of fiscal 2009 from 7.80% at the beginning of fiscal 2009 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our October 3, 2009 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense in fiscal 2010. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased total net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense for fiscal 2010 by $169 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 3, 2009 by $1.3 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased these amounts by $149 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.  

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% and 7.50% for the 2009 and 2008 actuarial valuations, respectively. The increase in the rate used for the year end 2009 actuarial valuation was due to changes in the ranges of expected returns on certain plan asset classes. A one percentage point change in the long-term return on pension plan asset assumption would impact fiscal 2010 annual pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately $57 million.  

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.  

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Investments  

The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if current events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill.  

To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.  

In light of recent adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. Because of the way the accounting rules work, a relatively modest reduction in our estimate of the fair value of our Broadcasting reporting unit could result in a significant goodwill impairment charge.  

The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.  

The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing the potential impairment for these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.  

48  

Table of Contents 

During the current year, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $279 million. The impairment charges include $142 million for FCC radio licenses and $65 million for our investment in UTV. During fiscal years 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $39 million and $26 million, respectively, related to FCC radio licenses. The FCC radio license impairment charges reflected overall market declines in certain radio markets in which we operate. These impairment charges, which were estimated using a discounted cash flow model, were recorded in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Allowance for doubtful accounts  

We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In light of the recent turmoil in the domestic and global economy that has affected many companies, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables from these companies have become subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods.  

Contingencies and Litigation  

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.  

Income Tax Audits  

As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Companys decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Companys success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.  

Stock Option Compensation Expense  

Each year during the second quarter, the Company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management and creative personnel (the Annual Grant). The Company uses a binomial valuation model which takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. The binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being cancelled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option. Accordingly, the Company believes that the binomial valuation model should produce a fair value that is representative of the value of an employee option.  

In fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, the weighted average assumptions used in the options-pricing models were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

49  

Table of Contents 

Although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the Companys assumptions may change the value of, and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants. The assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the expected volatility and expected exercise multiple. Increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively.  

The volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the Companys performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. If the expected volatility of 47% used by the Company during 2009 was increased or decreased by five percentage points (i.e. to 52% or to 42%), the weighted average grant date fair value of our 2009 stock option grants would have increased by 9% or decreased by 7%, respectively.  

The expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the Companys future stock performance, stock price volatility, and employee turnover rates. If the exercise multiple assumption of 1.39 used by the Company during 2009 were increased to 1.6 or decreased to 1.2, the weighted average binomial value of our 2009 stock option grants would have increased by 7% or decreased by 8%, respectively.  

ACCOUNTING CHANGES  

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. The guidance revises the criteria for separating, measuring, and allocating arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable, which must be estimated if there is no history of selling the deliverable on a stand-alone basis nor third-party evidence of selling price. The Company is assessing the potential effect of this guidance on its financial statements.  

Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets  

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the requirements for off balance sheet accounting for financial assets including limiting the circumstances where off balance sheet treatment for a portion of a financial asset is allowable, and require additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements.  

Variable Interest Entities  

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated. The new consolidation model for VIEs considers whether the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the entity. The guidance on VIEs requires companies to continually reassess VIEs to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The Company is assessing the potential effect of this guidance on its financial statements.  

Collaborative Arrangements  

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance that defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting and reporting requirements for such arrangements. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity, for example an agreement to co-produce and distribute a motion picture with another studio. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2010 fiscal year. The Company does not expect that the adoption of the guidance on collaborative arrangements will have a material impact on its financial statements.  

Business Combinations  

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance that establishes principles and requirements for determining how a company recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, including noncontrolling interests, contingent consideration, and certain acquired contingencies. The guidance on business combinations also requires acquisition-related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized. This guidance will be applicable prospectively to business combinations beginning in the Companys 2010 fiscal year.  

50  

Table of Contents 

Noncontrolling Interest (Minority Interests)  

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting and reporting for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary. Upon adoption of this guidance, the Company will be required to report its noncontrolling interests as a separate component of shareholders equity. The Company will also be required to present net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company separately in its consolidated statements of income. Currently, noncontrolling interests are reported between liabilities and shareholders equity in the Companys statement of financial position and the related income attributable to non-controlling interests is reflected as an expense in arriving at net income. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2010 fiscal year and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing non-controlling interests. All other requirements are to be applied prospectively.  

Employee Compensation  Retirement Benefits  

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The guidance on retirement benefits also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the end of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the recognition provision in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a $261 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the measurement date provision by remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations at the beginning of fiscal 2009. Adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a reduction of $35 million to retained earnings and a $100 million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income.  

Key assumptions used for the measurement of pension and postretirement medical plans at the beginning of fiscal 2009 were 7.80% for the discount rate, 7.50% for the rate of return on plan assets, and 5.00% for salary increases. Based on this measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations, pension and postretirement medical costs decreased to approximately $214 million for fiscal 2009 compared to $255 million for fiscal 2008. The decrease in pension and postretirement medical expense was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations.  

The Company remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations at October 3, 2009 in accordance with new guidance on accounting for retirement plans. Key assumptions for the measurement at October 3, 2009 were 5.75% for the discount rate, 7.75% for the rate of return on plan assets, and 4.50% for salary increases. Based on the measurement at October 3, 2009, the Company recorded an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense, which totals $2.8 billion ($1.8 billion after-tax) as of October 3, 2009.  

Income Tax  

In July 2006, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company adopted the guidance on income taxes at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. Applying the guidance on income taxes to all tax positions upon adoption resulted in reductions of $148 million and $15 million to opening retained earnings and minority interests, respectively.
