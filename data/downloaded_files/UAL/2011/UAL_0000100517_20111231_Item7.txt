ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview  

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, UAL) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are United Air Lines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, United) and, effective October 1, 2010, Continental Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Continental). Upon closing of the Merger, UAL Corporation changed its name to United Continental Holdings, Inc. We sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the Company in this Form 10-K for disclosures that relate to all of UAL, United and Continental.  

This Annual Report on Form 10-K is a combined report of UAL, United, and Continental including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidated United and Continental beginning October 1, 2010 for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to United or Continental activities also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. When appropriate, UAL, United and Continental are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures.  

2011 Financial Highlights  

       UAL recorded net income of $840 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to net income of $253 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding special items, UAL recorded net income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to net income of $942 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. See Item 6 of this report for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income.  

       UALs unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2011 was $7.8 billion as compared to $8.7 billion at December 31, 2010.  

2011 Operational Highlights  

       For the year ended December 31, 2011, United and Continental achieved solid results in DOT on-time arrival and completion factor, as summarized in the following table:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Consolidated traffic (RPMs) for 2011 decreased 1.4% as compared to 2010, while consolidated capacity (ASMs) remained flat from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 82.2% in 2011 versus a consolidated load factor of 83.2% in 2010, including Continental Predecessor prior to October 1, 2010.  

       The Company announced it will invest $550 million in onboard product improvements, including the addition of flat-bed seating on 62 additional long-haul aircraft, addition of Economy Plus seating to more than 300 aircraft, increase in the overhead storage space on more than 150 aircraft, installation of advanced broadband Wi-Fi on its mainline fleet, introduction of streaming wireless video onboard its Boeing 747-400 aircraft, and completely retrofitting its p.s. (Premium Service) fleet with upgraded interiors including flat-bed seats, Economy Plus and on-demand audio and video.  

Outlook  

Set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical

Table of Contents 

 operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in our forward-looking statements in this report. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.  

Merger Integration. During 2011, the Company received a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA), marking a significant achievement in the integration of United and Continental. The certificate gives the FAA a single point of oversight for our combined operations. It also allows all maintenance and operating activities to be considered as United by the FAA.  

In 2011, the Company announced that MileagePlus will be the loyalty program for the Company beginning in 2012.  

The Company has co-located check-in, ticket counter and gate facilities at 66 airports since closing the Merger and now has a single area for check-in at 291 airports systemwide. More than 800 aircraft are now rebranded in the new United livery.  

Some key initiatives for the Company in 2012 include converting to a single passenger service system, harmonizing other information technology systems, moving to a single website, making substantial fleet reallocations around the system and working to integrate certain employee groups. We currently expect to migrate to a single passenger service system in early March 2012, allowing the Company to operate using a single carrier code, flight schedule, inventory, website and departure control system.  

UAL expects the Merger to deliver $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion in net annual synergies on a run-rate basis in 2013, including between $800 million and $900 million of annual revenue synergies, in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network, fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by the broader network of the Company, and between $200 million and $300 million of net cost synergies. The Company has realized an estimated $400 million of synergies in 2011, comprised of $250 million of revenue synergies and $150 million of net cost synergies.  

The Company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger. The Company incurred approximately $450 million of integration-related cash costs in 2011 and expects to incur a similar amount in 2012 in categories generally consistent with 2011. There are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses, and many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. See Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this report and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information on the Merger.  

Economic Conditions. The severe global economic recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly diminished the demand for air travel, resulting in a difficult financial environment for U.S. network carriers. UALs financial performance improved significantly in 2010 and 2011 as a result of improving global economic conditions, the Merger, increasing passenger unit revenue and industry capacity discipline. Although we continue to see indications that the airline industry is experiencing a recovery, including stronger demand, increasing passenger unit revenue and improving revenue, we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement. Worsening economic conditions, such as continued European sovereign debt uncertainty, political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the Middle East and Africa may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2011 going into 2012.  

Capacity. Over the past year, UAL leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match market demand and added new routes from its hubs on the east and west coasts to international destinations such as Lagos, Nigeria; Guadalajara, Mexico; Montreal, Canada; Port au Prince, Haiti; Providenciales, Turks and Caicos; Shanghai, China; and Stuttgart, Germany, along with new intra-Asia routes between its Tokyo hub and Hong Kong and between its Guam hub and Okinawa, Japan. In addition, for 2012, UAL expects to add new routes from its hubs to Manchester, U.K.; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dublin, Ireland; and Durango, Mexico, subject to government approval. We expect capacity for 2012 to be relatively flat compared to 2011. Should fuel prices increase significantly, we would likely adjust our capacity plans downward.

Additional Revenue-Generating and Cost Saving Measures. We offer, and intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel, a portion of which will come from unbundling our current product and a portion of which will come from goods and services that we do not presently offer. The revenues that we derive from these products and services, which are generally referred to as ancillary revenues, typically have higher margins than that of our core transportation services and are an important element of our strategy to sustain the profitability that we achieved in 2011 and 2010. The unbundling of our current products and services, as well as our additional value-added products, offer customers flexibility and choice in selecting the products and services they are willing to purchase. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest in technology that is designed to both assist customers with self-service efficiently and allow us to make better operational decisions, while lowering our operating costs.  

Fuel Costs. Fuel prices continued to be volatile in 2011. UALs average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $3.06 in 2011 as compared to $2.39 in 2010. If fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels, we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs. In addition, high fuel prices may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2011 and 2010. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2012, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change UALs annual fuel expense by approximately $95 million. To protect against increases in the prices of fuel, the Company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements.  

Labor Costs. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 72% of employees represented by unions. We are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our employee groups. The Company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups, although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the Company.  

Results of Operations  

In this section, we compare UALs results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 with UALs results on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. UALs results of operations for 2010 on a combined basis consist of (1) UALs results of operations for 2010, which includes Continentals results from October 1 to December 31, 2010; and (2) Continentals results from January 1 to September 30, 2010. Given the significant level of integration activity in 2011, we believe this presentation of the 2010 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing UALs financial performance in 2011 and 2010. This presentation differs from the comparison of 2010 and 2009 results, which compares UALs financial performance year-over-year excluding the Merger impact in 2010, represented by Continental Successor results in the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor UALs performance on a consistent basis.

2011 compared to 2010  

Operating Revenue  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in UALs operating revenues for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents UALs passenger revenues and operating data based on geographic region:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) 2010 passenger revenue and operating data prepared from UAL results combined with Continental Predecessor results for the period in 2010 prior to the Merger.  

On a combined basis, consolidated passenger revenue in 2011 increased approximately $2.8 billion, or 9.3%, as compared to 2010. These increases were due to increases of 12.2% and 10.9% in average fare per passenger and yield, respectively, over the same period as a result of improved pricing primarily from industry capacity discipline. The reduced traffic from both business and leisure passengers in 2011 was offset by higher fares, which drove improvements in both average fare per passenger and yield. The average fare per passenger also increased in the 2011 period, as compared to the 2010 period, due to a number of fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices.  

Passenger revenue also increased in 2011 as a result of certain accounting changes, as described in Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report. In conjunction with these changes, the Company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by $107 million in connection with a modification to its Co-Brand Agreement.  

Cargo revenue increased by $7 million, or 0.6%, on a combined basis in 2011 as compared to 2010. Reduced cargo volume in 2011 was offset by higher yields. UALs freight ton miles decreased 13.7% in 2011 as compared to 2010, while mail ton miles improved slightly by 2.2% during the same period, for a composite cargo traffic  

39  

Table of Contents 

 decline of 11.9%. Freight yields in 2011 increased 18% compared to 2010 due to higher fuel surcharges and processing fees. Mail yields decreased nearly 10% in 2011 as compared to 2010 in all geographic regions except for Latin America.  

On a combined basis, other operating revenue was up $111 million, or 3.5%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, which was primarily due to growth in ancillary passenger-related charges.  

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to UALs operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The significant increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased fuel prices, as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions). See Note 13 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled fuel hedge positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the periods.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related costs increased $123 million, or 1.6%, in 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase was due to several factors including a slight increase in the number of average full-time employees year-over-year, higher pay rates primarily driven by new collective bargaining agreements, increase in seniority levels, a one-time signing bonus for certain employee groups and increased accruals in profit sharing and related payroll tax payments in 2011 as compared to 2010.  

Expenses related to aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased by $230 million, or 15.2%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to increased rates on aircraft engine maintenance.  

40  

Table of Contents 

Depreciation and amortization increased by $88 million, or 6%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, due to increased expense associated with the increase in basis from recording Continentals assets at fair value in connection with the Merger, including the frequent flyer database, and the increased capitalization of new projects, including those related to Uniteds international premium travel products, which are the products used on our international service.  

Aircraft rent expense decreased by $180 million, or 15.1%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting.  

The table below presents integration and Merger-related costs and special items incurred by UAL during the years ended December 31 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Integration and Merger-related costs include compensation costs related to systems integration and training, costs to repaint aircraft in the new livery and other branding activities, costs to write-off or accelerate depreciation on systems and facilities that are no longer used or planned to be used for significantly shorter periods, severance primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions and a charge related to the Companys obligation to issue 8% Contingent Senior Unsecured Notes (the 8% Notes). See Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information related to special items.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in interest expense of $137 million, or 12.6%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt.  

In 2011, miscellaneous, net included fuel hedge ineffectiveness of $59 million primarily resulting from a decrease in fuel hedge values in excess of the decrease in aircraft fuel prices. The ineffectiveness is primarily  

41  

Table of Contents 

 related to the Companys portfolio of crude oil derivative contracts. In 2010, miscellaneous, net included a gain of $21 million from the distribution to United of the remaining United Series 2001-1 enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) trust assets upon repayment of the note obligations.  

2010 compared to 2009  

Operating Revenue  

To provide a more meaningful comparison of UALs 2010 financial performance to 2009, we quantified the increases relating to our operating results that are due to Continentals results after the Merger closing date. The increases due to the Merger, presented in the tables below, represent actual Continental Successor results for the fourth quarter of 2010. The discussion of UALs results excludes the impact of Continental Successor results in the fourth quarter of 2010.  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in UALs operating revenues for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table below presents selected UAL passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Excluding the impact of the Merger, consolidated passenger revenue in 2010 increased approximately $2.9 billion, or 20.2%, as compared to 2009. These increases were due to increases of 18.6% and 15.7% in average fare per passenger and yield, respectively, over the same period as a result of strengthening economic conditions and industry capacity discipline. An increase in volume in 2010, as measured by passenger volume also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009. The revenue improvement in 2010 was also driven by the return of business and international premium cabin passengers whose higher ticket prices combined to increase average fare per passenger and yields. The international regions in particular had the largest increases in demand with international passenger unit revenue per ASM increasing 29.4% on a 1.8% increase in capacity. Passenger revenue in 2010 included approximately $250 million of additional revenue due to changes in the Companys estimate and methodology related to loyalty program accounting as noted in Critical Accounting Policies, below.  

42  

Table of Contents 

Excluding the impact of the Merger, cargo revenue increased by $177 million, or 33%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to improved economic conditions resulting in improved traffic and yield. UALs freight ton miles improved by 22.1% in 2010 as compared to 2009, while mail ton miles dropped approximately 8.8% during the same period, for a composite cargo traffic gain of 18.3%. Freight yields in 2010 were 15% better than in 2009 due to stronger freight traffic, reduced industry capacity and numerous tactical rate recovery initiatives, particularly in UALs Pacific markets. On a composite basis, cargo yield in 2010 increased 12.6% as compared to 2009.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, other operating revenue was up 23.5% in 2010 as compared to 2009, which was primarily due to growth in ancillary passenger-related charges such as baggage fees.  

Operating Expense  

The table below includes data related to UALs operating expense for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for fuel, as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2010 amounts presented in the table below exclude the impact of Continental Successor after the closing date of the Merger. See Note 13 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the period.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Excluding the impact of the Merger, salaries and related costs increased $297 million, or 7.6%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased accruals for profit sharing and other annual incentive plans. In 2010, UALs accrual for profit sharing was $166 million. Expense for the plan was not accrued in 2009 as the profit sharing and other incentive plan payouts were not earned based on UALs adjusted pre-tax losses.  

43  

Table of Contents 

Excluding the impact of the Merger, regional capacity purchase expense increased $87 million, or 5.7%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in capacity in the same period.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, distribution expenses increased $86 million, or 12.8%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in passenger revenue on higher traffic and yields driving increases in commissions, credit card fees and GDS fees.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, aircraft rent expense decreased by $20 million, or 5.8%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of Uniteds retirement of its entire fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, some of which were financed through operating leases. This fleet retirement was completed during 2009.  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, UAL recorded $130 million to other operating expenses, $65 million each for United and Continental, due to revenue sharing obligations related to the trans-Atlantic joint venture with Lufthansa and Air Canada. This expense relates to UALs retroactive payments for the first nine months of 2010, prior to execution of the joint venture agreement.  

The table below presents Merger-related costs and special items incurred by UAL during the years ended December 31 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See Note 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information related to special items.  

Merger-related costs include costs related to the planning and execution of the Merger, including costs for items such as financial advisor, legal and other advisory fees. Also included in Merger-related costs are salary and severance related costs that are primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions and compensation costs related to the Merger. Merger-related costs also include integration costs, costs to terminate certain service contracts that will not be used by the Company, costs to write-off system assets that are no longer used or planned to be used by the Company and payments to third-party consultants to assist with integration planning and organization design. See Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.  

The aircraft impairments in 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to a decrease in the estimated market value of UALs nonoperating Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft. In 2010, UAL recorded a $29 million impairment ($18 million, net of taxes) of its indefinite-lived Brazil routes due to an estimated decrease in the value of these routes as a result of the open skies agreement between the United States and Brazil.  

During 2010, UAL determined it overstated its deferred tax liabilities by approximately $64 million when it applied fresh start accounting upon its exit from bankruptcy in 2006. Under applicable standards in 2008, this error would have been corrected with a decrease to goodwill, which would have resulted in a decrease in the amount of UALs 2008 goodwill impairment charge. Therefore, UAL corrected this overstatement in the fourth quarter of 2010 by reducing its deferred tax liabilities and recorded it as a goodwill impairment credit in its statement of consolidated operations. The adjustment was not made to prior periods as UAL does not believe the correction is material to the 2010 or any prior period.  

44  

Table of Contents 

In 2009, UAL recorded a $150 million intangible asset impairment ($95 million, net of taxes) to decrease the value of Uniteds tradename, which was primarily due to a decrease in estimated future revenues resulting from the weak economic environment and Uniteds capacity reductions, among other factors.  

In 2009, UAL recorded special charges of $27 million related to the final settlement of the LAX municipal bond litigation and $104 million primarily related to Boeing 737 aircraft lease terminations.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009, excluding the Merger impact, was primarily due to higher interest rates on average debt outstanding in 2010 as compared to comparable rates on average debt outstanding in 2009, as certain of the Companys financings have terms with higher interest rates as compared to debt that has been repaid. The higher interest rates were due to distressed capital markets and the Companys credit and liquidity outlook at the time of the financings.  

In 2010, miscellaneous, net included a gain of $21 million from the distribution to United of the remaining United Series 2001-1 EETC assets upon repayment of the note obligations. In addition, miscellaneous, net included $10 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains in 2010 on fuel hedge contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges, as compared to $31 million of fuel hedge gains in 2009. The fuel hedge gains in 2009 resulted from hedge contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges.   

United and ContinentalResults of Operations2011 Compared to 2010  

United and Continentals Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been abbreviated pursuant to General Instructions I(2)(a) of Form 10-K.

Table of Contents 

United  

The following table presents information related to Uniteds results of operations (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

United had net income of $281 million in 2011 as compared to net income of $399 million in 2010. As compared to 2010, Uniteds consolidated revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 7%, to $21.2 billion during 2011. These increases were primarily due to year-over-year capacity discipline, which in turn resulted in improved pricing and higher average fares, as discussed in UALs results of operations above. Uniteds traffic and capacity decreased approximately 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively, while passenger revenue per available seat mile increased approximately 8.0%. Average fares were also higher due to fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices.  

Uniteds passenger revenue also increased in 2011 as a result of certain accounting changes as described in Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report. In conjunction with these changes, the Company recorded a special adjustment to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by $88 million in connection with a modification to its Chase Co-Brand Agreement in 2011.  

Uniteds operating expenses increased approximately $1.5 billion, or 8%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, which was primarily due to the following:  

       An increase of approximately $1.4 billion, or 24.2%, in aircraft fuel expense, which was primarily driven by increased prices for aircraft fuel, as highlighted in the fuel table in 2011 compared to 2010Operating Expense, above;  

       A decrease of $49 million, or 4.5%, in landing fees and other rent was primarily due to higher than anticipated credits (refunds) received in 2011 as a result of airports audits of prior period payment; and  

       An increase of $180 million, or 18.4%, in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs primarily due to increased rates and volume on aircraft maintenance.  

Uniteds nonoperating expense decreased $28 million, or 4.4%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, which was primarily due to the pay down of debt obligations in 2011.

Continental  

The table below presents the Continental Successor and Predecessor periods in 2010. The combined presentation for the year ended December 31, 2010 does not represent a GAAP presentation. Management believes that the combined non-GAAP results for 2010 provide a more meaningful comparison to the full year 2011. Continentals operating income and net income in the 2011 period were $950 million and $569 million, respectively, as compared to operating and net income of $698 million and $346 million, respectively, in the combined 2010 period. These improvements were largely due to year-over-year capacity discipline.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total revenues increased 12.7% in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period, primarily due to higher passenger fares driven by improving global economic conditions and an increased demand for air travel. Continentals capacity increased approximately 1.9% while its traffic remained flat. PRASM increased approximately 11.7%. Continentals year-over-year improvement in Yield of approximately 13.1% is driven primarily by increases in its domestic and Latin markets. Additionally, the Company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by $19 million in connection with a modification to its Chase Co-Brand Agreement.  

Aircraft fuel expense increased 37.2% in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period, primarily due to an increase in the prices of aircraft fuel. Continental had fuel hedge gains of $86 million in 2011 as compared to fuel hedge losses of $9 million in 2010. Continentals fuel purchase cost, without hedge impacts, increased approximately 39.8% in 2011 as compared to 2010, which is relatively consistent with UALs unhedged cost of fuel summarized in the tables above.  

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased by $61 million, or 11.4%, in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period, primarily due to increased rates on aircraft engine maintenance and the expiration of warranty coverage on certain aircraft parts.  

Continentals depreciation and amortization expense increased by $69 million, or 12.4%, in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period, primarily due to increased expense associated with recording Continentals assets at fair value as of the Merger closing date.  

47  

Table of Contents 

Aircraft rent decreased $177 million, or 20.5%, in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period, primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of December 31, 2011, UAL had $7.8 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which is $918 million lower than at December 31, 2010. The Company also has a $500 million undrawn Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, UAL also had $569 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for performance bonds, letters of credit, credit card processing agreements and estimated future workers compensation claims. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations that are not currently backed by cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 totaled $387 million. As of December 31, 2011, United had cash collateralized $194 million of letters of credit, most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the Amended Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had all of its commitment capacity under its new $500 million Revolving Credit Facility available for letters of credit or borrowings.  

As is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital. We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. At December 31, 2011, UAL had approximately $12.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.3 billion that are due within the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial non-cancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. The Company reduced debt and capital lease obligations by $2.6 billion in 2011.  

As of December 31, 2011, United had firm commitments to purchase 50 new aircraft (25 Boeing 787 aircraft and 25 Airbus A350XWB aircraft) scheduled for delivery from 2016 through 2019. United also has options to purchase 42 Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft, and purchase rights for 50 Boeing 787 aircraft and 50 Airbus A350XWB aircraft. United has secured considerable backstop financing commitments from its aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. However, United can provide no assurance that backstop financing, or any other financing not already in place, for aircraft and engine deliveries will be available to United on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.  

As of December 31, 2011, Continental had firm commitments to purchase 82 new aircraft (57 Boeing 737 aircraft and 25 Boeing 787 aircraft) scheduled for delivery from 2012 through 2016. Continental expects to place into service 19 Boeing 737 aircraft, of which two have been delivered prior to the filing of this report, and five Boeing 787 aircraft in 2012. Continental also has options to purchase 89 additional Boeing 737 and 787 aircraft. Continental does not have backstop financing or any other financing currently in place for the Boeing aircraft on order. Financing will be necessary to satisfy Continentals capital commitments for its firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. Continental can provide no assurance that backstop financing, or any other financing not already in place, for aircraft and engine deliveries will be available to Continental on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.  

The Company is currently in discussions with Boeing over potential compensation related to delays in the 787 aircraft deliveries. The Company is not able to estimate the ultimate success, amount of, nature or timing of any potential recoveries from Boeing over such delays.  

As of December 31, 2011, a substantial portion of UALs assets, principally aircraft, spare engines, aircraft spare parts, route authorities and certain other intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.  

Although access to the capital markets improved in 2011 and 2010, as evidenced by our financing transactions in both years, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access

 the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines.  

The following is a discussion of UALs sources and uses of cash from 2009 to 2011. As UAL applied the acquisition method of accounting to the Merger, UALs cash activities discussed below include Continentals activities only after October 1, 2010.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

2011 compared to 2010  

UALs cash from operating activities increased by $501 million in 2011, as compared to 2010. Cash from operations improved due to the Companys improved operational performance in 2011. The Companys increased revenues were offset in part by higher cash operating expenses resulting from the Merger, including fuel and aircraft maintenance expense.  

2010 compared to 2009  

UALs cash from operating activities increased by $941 million in 2010, as compared to 2009. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services. Higher cash operating expenses, including fuel, distribution costs and interest expense, partially offset the benefit from increased revenues. Operating cash flows in the 2009 period included the receipt of $160 million related to the relocation of UALs OHare cargo facility.  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

2011 compared to 2010  

UALs capital expenditures were $700 million and $371 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately half of the capital expenditures in 2011 related to aircraft upgrades across the Companys fleet for its international premium travel product as well as various facility and ground equipment projects. Some of these capital expenditures relate to improvements to assets as a result of the Merger. Also, in 2011, the Company had purchased nine aircraft that were operated under leases for $88 million and were immediately sold to third parties upon acquisition for proceeds of $72 million.  

In December 2011, United cash collateralized $194 million of its letters of credit that had previously been issued and collateralized under the Amended Credit Facility, resulting in an increase in restricted cash, as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, above.  

UAL increased its short-term investments, net of proceeds, by $898 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. This was primarily due to the placement of additional funds with outside money managers and movement of liquid assets from cash to short-term investments. Uniteds short-term investments, net of proceeds, increased by $269 million while Continentals short-term investments, net of proceeds, increased by $629 million in 2011 as compared to 2010.  

2010 compared to 2009  

UALs capital expenditures were $371 million and $317 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in UALs 2010 capital expenditures are Continentals capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to cash capital expenditures, UALs asset additions include Continentals acquisition of three Boeing 737 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2010. The proceeds of Continentals EETC financing in the fourth quarter of 2010 (described below) were directly issued to the aircraft manufacturers; therefore, these proceeds are not presented as capital expenditures and financing proceeds in the statements of consolidated cash flows. UAL limited its spending in both 2010 and 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highest-value projects.  

49  

Table of Contents 

In 2009, United received $175 million from three sale-leaseback agreements. These transactions were accounted for as capital leases, resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009.  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

Significant financing events in 2011 were as follows:  

       The Company entered into a new $500 million Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks, led by Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent. The facility was undrawn at December 31, 2011 and has an expiration date of January 30, 2015. It is secured by take-off and landing slots at Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and Washington Reagan and certain other assets of United and Continental. The Company terminated its prior $255 million revolver under the Amended Credit Facility on December 21, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, United had cash collateralized $194 million of letters of credit, most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the Amended Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had all of its commitment capacity under its new $500 million Revolving Credit Facility available for letters of credit or borrowings;  

       During 2011, UAL made debt and capital lease payments of $2.6 billion. These payments include $150 million related to UALs 5% Senior Convertible Notes and $570 million related to UALs 4.5% Senior Limited-Subordination Convertible Notes; and  

       Continental received $239 million in 2011 from its December 2010 pass-through trust financing. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of new aircraft and in the case of the currently owned aircraft, for general corporate purposes.  

Significant financing events in 2010 were as follows:  

       In January 2010, United issued $500 million of the United Senior Secured Notes due 2013 and $200 million of the United Senior Second Lien Notes due 2013, which are secured by Uniteds route authority to operate between the United States and Japan and beyond Japan to points in other countries, certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes;  

       In January 2010, United issued the remaining $1.3 billion in principal amount of the equipment notes relating to the Series 2009-1 and 2009-2 EETCs. Issuance proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion were used to repay the Series 2000-2 and 2001-1 EETCs and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes;  

       In December 2010, Continental issued approximately $427 million of Series 2010-1 Class A and Class B pass-through certificates through two pass-through trusts. In December 2010, Continental issued $188 million in principal amount of equipment notes relating to its December 2010 pass-through trust financing. Continental used $90 million of the proceeds for general corporate purposes and $98 million of the proceeds to purchase three new Boeing 737 aircraft. The proceeds used to purchase the three new Boeing 737 aircraft were accounted for as a noncash investing and financing activity; and  

       In 2010, United acquired six aircraft through the exercise of its lease purchase options. Aircraft lease deposits of $236 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by United to make the final payments due under these capital lease obligations.  

Significant financing events in 2009 for UAL and United were as follows:  

       $322 million from multiple financings by United that are secured by certain aircraft spare parts, aircraft and spare engines;  

       $345 million from UALs issuance of 6% Senior Convertible Notes due 2029;  

50  

Table of Contents 

       $161 million from Uniteds partial issuance of equipment notes related to the Series 2009-1 and Series 2009-2 EETCs described above in 2010 financing activities; and  

       $222 million in net proceeds from the issuance of UAL common stock, consisting of $90 million from the completion of UALs equity offering program that began in 2008 and $132 million, net of fees, from the issuance of 19.0 million shares of UAL common stock in an underwritten, public offering for a price of $7.24 per share.  

The proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by $984 million used for scheduled long-term debt and capital lease payments during 2009, as well as $49 million used for payment of various costs associated with such transactions.  

For additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events, see Notes 5, 14 and 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report.  

Credit Ratings. As of the filing date of this report, UAL, United and Continental had the following corporate credit ratings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability and/or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Below is a summary of additional liquidity matters. See the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Debt Covenants. Certain of the Companys financing agreements have covenants that impose certain operating and financial restrictions, as applicable, on the Company, on United and its material subsidiaries, or on Continental and its subsidiaries. Among other covenants, the Amended Credit Facility requires UAL, United and certain of Uniteds material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the Amended Credit Facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) of $1.0 billion at all times; a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations (that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released); and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.0 for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain at least $3.0 billion of unrestricted liquidity at all times, which includes unrestricted cash, short term investments and any undrawn amounts under any revolving credit facility, and to maintain a minimum ratio of appraised value of collateral to the outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility of 1.67 to 1.0. Among other covenants, the indentures governing the Senior Notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations as of certain reference periods. If the value of the collateral underlying that issuers Senior Notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to  

51  

Table of Contents 

 debt obligations, the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 2% per annum, provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders lien or repay a portion of the Senior Notes. A breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the Amended Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility or the indentures governing the Senior Notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations. The indentures governing the United Senior Notes contain a cross-acceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facility would result in a default under such indentures. The Revolving Credit Facility includes events of default customary for similar financings. In addition, the Amended Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions pursuant to which default and/or acceleration of certain other material indebtedness of the Company could result in a default under the Amended Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, or both.  

Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.  

The table below provides a summary of UALs material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Long-term debt presented in UALs financial statements is net of a $225 million debt discount which is being amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount. Contractual long-term debt includes $93 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a company that leases three aircraft from United. The creditors only recourse to United is repossession of the aircraft.  

 (b) Includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $103 million in 2012, $99 million in 2013, $89 million in 2014, $71 million in 2015, $64 million in 2016 and $373 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.  

 (c) Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our capacity purchase agreements and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. Amounts also exclude a portion of Uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its capacity purchase agreements. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.  

 (d) Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2021. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.  

 (e) Represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for Continental plans only, as the United plans are not material. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies, below, for a discussion of our assumptions regarding UALs pension plans.  

 (f) Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft and spare engines only, net of previously paid purchase deposits, and noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services, primarily information technology support. See Note 17 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.

Contingencies  

Contingent Senior Unsecured Notes 

UAL is obligated under an indenture to issue to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Notes in up to eight equal tranches of $62.5 million if a triggering event occurs (with each tranche issued no later than 45 days following the end of any applicable fiscal year). A triggering event occurs when UALs EBITDAR (as defined in the 8% Notes indenture) exceeds $3.5 billion over the prior 12 months ending June 30 or December 31 of any applicable fiscal year. The 12 month measurement periods began with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and will end with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. If any 8% Notes are issued, the Company will not receive any cash.  

Financial triggering events under the 8% Notes indenture occurred at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011 and, as a result, UAL issued two tranches of $62.5 million of the 8% Notes to the PBGC in January 2012. These tranches will mature 15 years from their respective triggering dates with interest accruing from the triggering date at a rate of 8% per annum. The notes are payable in cash in semi-annual installments starting June 30, 2012 and will be callable, at UALs option, at any time at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

These are the first two such occurrences of UALs obligation to issue the 8% Notes. Since the issuance of subsequent tranches of the 8% Notes is based upon future operating results, UAL cannot predict whether future issuances will occur or the timing of any such issuances. Any future issuances of the 8% Notes could adversely impact the Companys results of operations because of increased charges to earnings for the then fair value of the principal amount of the notes issued and increased interest expense related to the 8% Notes. Issuance of such notes could adversely impact the Companys liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments.  

Legal and Environmental. The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  

Other Contingencies. Many aspects of the Companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local and international laws protecting the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments, such as climate change regulations in the U.S. and abroad, could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. There are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the Company, including the EU ETS (which is subject to international dispute), environmental taxes for certain international flights (including the United Kingdoms Air Passenger Duty and Germanys departure ticket tax), limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements, and the State of Californias cap and trade regulations (which impacts Uniteds San Francisco maintenance center). In addition, there are land-based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects, requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions, and could affect airlines in certain circumstances.  

As of January 1, 2012, the EU ETS required the Company to ensure that by each compliance date, it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to flights to and from EU member states in the preceding calendar year. Such allowances are to be surrendered on an annual basis to the relevant government with an initial compliance date of April 30, 2013 for emissions subject to the EU ETS in 2012. For 2012, the Company estimates it will receive from the United Kingdom allowances equal to approximately 80% of the Companys carbon emissions relative to the 2010 base year, leaving a remaining amount that will need to be purchased by the Company. The amount of such allowances provided by the United Kingdom is expected to decrease in the future, potentially leaving a greater amount of allowances that may be required to be purchased. Additionally, any increase in emissions would require the purchase of additional carbon  

53  

Table of Contents 

 allowances by the Company. As the scheme continues to be the subject of international dispute, it is unclear whether or not the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS will be sustained. Management continues to evaluate what the impact would be for the Company in 2012.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. The Companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had cash collateralized $194 million of letters of credit, most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the Amended Credit Facility, and $163 million of performance bonds. Continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate, customs and aircraft financing obligations at December 31, 2011 in the amount of $71 million. Most of the United and Continental letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the bonds have expiration dates through 2015.  

As of December 31, 2011, United and Continental are the guarantors of approximately $270 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon, excluding the US Airways contingent liability described below. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in Uniteds and Continentals financial statements. The leasing arrangements associated with a minority of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. The annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, above.  

Continental is contingently liable for US Airways obligations under a lease agreement between US Airways and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey related to the East End Terminal at LaGuardia (which lease agreement was assigned by US Airways to Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta)). These obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the Port Authority and the payment of other rentals in respect of the full amounts owed on special facilities revenue bonds issued by the Port Authority having an outstanding par amount of $79 million at December 31, 2011, and a final scheduled maturity in 2015. If both US Airways and Delta default on these obligations, Continental would be obligated to cure the default and would have the right to occupy the terminal after US Airways and Deltas interest in the lease had been terminated.  

Increased Cost Provisions. In the Companys financing transactions that include loans, the Company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on LIBOR, for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders. At December 31, 2011, UAL had $2.9 billion of floating rate debt (consisting of Uniteds $2.1 billion and Continentals $820 million of debt) and $405 million of fixed rate debt (consisting of Uniteds $205 million and Continentals $200 million of debt), with remaining terms of up to ten years, that are subject to these increased cost provisions. In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-U.S. entities, with remaining terms of up to ten years and an aggregate balance of $3.3 billion (consisting of Uniteds $2.3 billion and Continentals $964 million balance), we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.  

Fuel Consortia. The Company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the  

54  

Table of Contents 

 consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $1.4 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which UAL participates, as to which UAL and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December 31, 2011, UALs contingent exposure was approximately $271 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. As of December 31, 2011, Uniteds and Continentals contingent exposure related to these bonds, based on its recent consortia participation, was approximately $214 million and $57 million, respectively. The Companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which range from 2011 to 2041. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.  

United and ContinentalCash Flows Activities2011 Compared to 2010  

United  

Operating Activities  

Uniteds cash from operating activities decreased by $379 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. This year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles. Uniteds net income in 2011 was $118 million lower than 2010.  

Investing Activities  

Uniteds capital expenditures were $464 million and $318 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Consistent with UALs investing activities discussed above, Uniteds capital expenditures in 2011 related to aircraft upgrades across the Companys fleet for its international premium travel product as well as various facility and ground equipment projects.  

In 2011, purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds, was $269 million. United did not have any short-term investments in 2010. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to the placement of additional funds with outside money managers and movement of liquid assets from cash to short-term investments.  

Also, as of December 31, 2011, United had cash collateralized $194 million of letters of credit, most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the Amended Credit Facility, resulting in an increase in restricted cash, as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, above.  

Financing Activities  

Uniteds significant financing activities in 2011 and 2010 are described in the above discussion of UALs financing activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report.  

Continental  

Operating Activities  

Continentals cash from operating activities decreased by $411 million in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period. This year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles, a decrease in receivables and a decrease in advance ticket sales.  

55  

Table of Contents 

Investing Activities  

Continentals capital expenditures were $236 million and $300 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, Continental acquired aircraft in both 2011 and 2010 with proceeds from financings that were delivered directly to the manufacturer. See Note 18 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for information related to these non-cash financing and investing activities.  

In 2011, purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds, was $629 million, as compared to $273 million in 2010. This year-over-year variance was primarily due to investment of higher cash balances and more funds being placed with outside money managers and moving liquid assets from cash to short-term investments.  

Financing Activities  

Continentals significant financing activities in 2011 and 2010 are described in the above discussion of UALs financing activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report.   

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.  

Passenger Revenue Recognition. The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. The Company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United and Continental as passenger revenues when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date. Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected. The fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Companys additional service to modify a previous sale. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets expire after one year. The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results. The Company recognizes cargo and other revenue as service is provided. See separate discussion in Frequent Flyer Accounting, below.  

Frequent Flyer Accounting. United and Continental have frequent flyer programs that are designed to increase customer loyalty. Program participants earn mileage credits (miles) by flying on United, Continental and certain other participating airlines. Program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in the Companys loyalty programs. We sell miles to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. The Company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.

In the case of the sale of air services, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles. The adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13) resulted in the revision of this accounting, effective January 1, 2011.  

Under the Companys prior accounting policy, the Company estimated the weighted average equivalent ticket value by assigning a fair value to the miles that were issued in connection with the sale of air transportation. The equivalent ticket value is a weighted average ticket value of each outstanding mile, based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed. The fair value of the miles was deferred and the residual amount of ticket proceeds was recognized as passenger revenue at the time the air transportation was provided.  

The Company began applying the new guidance in 2011 and determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. The total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis. The estimated selling price of miles is computed using an estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value that is adjusted by a sales discount that considers a number of factors, including ultimate fulfillment expectations associated with miles sold in flight transactions to various customer groups.  

Generally, as compared to the historical accounting policy, the new accounting policy decreases the value of miles that the Company records as deferred revenue and increases the passenger revenue recorded at the time air transportation is provided. The application of the new accounting method to passenger ticket transactions resulted in the following estimated increases to revenue (in millions, except per share amounts):

United and Continental also each had significant contracts to sell frequent flyer miles to their co-branded credit card partner, Chase. In June 2011, these contracts were modified and the Company entered into The Consolidated Amended and Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement dated June 9, 2011, (the Co-Brand Agreement) with Chase.  

The Company historically had two primary revenue elements, marketing and air transportation, in the case of miles sold to non- airline third parties. The Company applied the material modification provisions of ASU 2009-13 to the Co-Brand Agreement in June 2011 when the contract was amended. After the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company identified five revenue elements in the Co-Brand Agreement: the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation); use of the United brand and access to frequent flyer member lists; advertising; baggage services; and airport lounge usage (together, excluding the air transportation element, the marketing-related deliverables).  

The fair value of the elements is determined using managements estimated selling price of each element. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the Co-Brand Agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered.

The estimated selling price of miles calculated is generally consistent with the methodology as described above in Passenger Revenue Recognition.   

Under accounting prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company used an equivalent ticket value to determine the fair value of miles. The new guidance changed the allocation of arrangement consideration to the number of units of accounting; however, the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for those units did not change. The Company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered. The other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned. Pending new or materially modified contracts after January 1, 2011, certain other non-airline partners who participate in the loyalty programs and to which we sell miles remain subject to our historical residual accounting method.  

The application of the new accounting standard decreases the value of the air transportation deliverable related to the Co-Brand Agreement that the Company records as deferred revenue (and ultimately passenger revenue when redeemed awards are flown) and increases the value primarily of the marketing-related deliverables recorded in other revenue at the time these marketing-related deliverables are provided. The annual impact of this accounting change on operating revenue will decrease over time. Our ability to project the annual decline for each year is significantly impacted by credit card sales volumes, frequent flyer redemption patterns and other factors. Excluding the effects disclosed in the Special Revenue Item section below, the impact of adoption of ASU 2009-13 resulted in the following estimated increases to revenue (in millions, except per share amounts):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Effective January 1, 2012, UAL updated its estimated selling price for miles to the rate at which we sell miles to our Star Alliance partners participating in reciprocal frequent flyer programs, as the estimated selling price for miles. Management believes this change is a change in estimate, and as such, the change will be applied as a prospective change effective January 1, 2012. The estimated impact of this change is to reduce 2012 consolidated revenue by approximately $100 million.  

UAL accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we referred to as breakage, using the redemption method. UAL reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. During the first quarter of 2010, UAL obtained additional historical data, previously unavailable, which enabled it to refine its estimate of the amount of breakage in its population of miles, increasing the estimate of miles in the population expected to expire. Both the change in estimate and methodology have been applied prospectively effective, January 1, 2010. UAL and United estimate these changes increased passenger revenue by approximately $250 million, or $1.21 per UAL basic share ($0.99 per UAL diluted share), in the year ended December 31, 2010.  

The Companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.

In 2011, the Company announced that MileagePlus will be the loyalty program for the Company beginning in 2012. Moving to a single loyalty program will be a significant milestone in the integration of the two airlines. Continentals OnePass program will formally end in the first quarter of 2012 at which point United will automatically enroll OnePass members in MileagePlus and deposit into those MileagePlus accounts award miles equal to their OnePass award miles balance. The Company currently does not expect a material impact in redemptions from merging its two loyalty programs.  

Asset Impairments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever an indicator of impairment exists.  

Goodwill as of December 31, 2011 represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of Continentals assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Merger. All goodwill and other purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to Continentals financial statements.  

Goodwill is measured for impairment by initially comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded.  

The Company has one consolidated reporting unit. In 2011, the Company estimated the fair value of the consolidated reporting unit using both an income and a market approach. The income approach computes fair value by discounting future cash flows of the business and is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs (including fuel prices), appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions. The market approach computes fair value by adding a control premium to the Companys market capitalization. The Companys fair value exceeded its carrying value under both approaches and no goodwill impairment was recorded in 2011.  

The Company is also required to assess the goodwill recorded on the separate financial statements of Continental for impairment. The fair value of Continental was determined by allocating a percentage of the fair value of the consolidated Company (as determined and described in the paragraph above). The percentage of the consolidated fair value allocated to Continental was based on a number of measures, including revenue share, operating earnings share, available seat mile share, revenue passenger mile share and passenger share. Based on these criteria, this resulted in a fair value allocation of such assets to Continental and United of 44% and 56%, respectively. The fair value of Continental exceeded its carrying value and no goodwill impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2011.  

The Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain international route authorities, take-off and landing slots at various airports, airline partner alliances, the UAL trade name and logo. The fair values of the assets for purposes of the annual impairment test were determined using the market and income approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. We utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take-off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value the international  

59  

Table of Contents 

 route authorities, airline partner alliances, the UAL logo and trade name, and certain airport take-off and landing slots. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money.  

In most cases, these indefinite-lived assets are separately associated with and directly assignable to each separate subsidiary. In cases where the asset is shared between separate subsidiaries, the fair value was allocated using the same method as described above for the goodwill impairment test. Any impairment charges resulting from the testing of the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets are also assigned to the applicable separate subsidiary.  

UAL recorded impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets of $4 million and $29 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, Continental recorded a $4 million impairment of certain intangible assets related to foreign take-off and landing slots due to a change in our slot allocation times. In 2010, UAL recorded a $29 million impairment of its Brazil routes primarily due to the open skies agreement between the United States and Brazil which may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes. The valuation of the Brazil routes is based on an income methodology using estimated future cash flows from operation of the routes.  

In 2009, using an income methodology which was based on estimated future cash flows, United recorded impairment charges of $150 million to decrease the carrying value of its tradename. The most significant impact on the estimated fair value was a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues due to poor global economic conditions.  

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets. The net book value of operating property and equipment for UAL was $16.4 billion and $16.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.  

The Company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of United and Continental and the practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the Companys fleet plan and other relevant information. A one year increase in the average depreciable life of UALs flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $45 million.  

Uniteds aircraft impairments during 2010 and 2009 were due to aircraft that were grounded or planned to be grounded, or certain aircraft that were not operated by United. The aircraft impairments primarily related to Uniteds Boeing 737 fleet, which United removed from service, and five Boeing 747 aircraft, which it removed from service as part of Uniteds capacity reduction plans that were initiated in 2008. Fair value was estimated using the market approach. Asset appraisals, published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by United in its market value determination. Several impairments of the Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft occurred from 2008 to 2010 due to the weak economy and reduced demand for these particular aircraft, among other factors.  

In addition to the Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft, in 2009, UAL tested five of its owned regional jets, which were leased to a third party, for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of

 approximately one year. As a result of this testing, UAL recorded impairment charges of $19 million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of December 31, 2009.  

Benefit Accounting. UALs pension plans under-funded status was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2011, nearly all of which is attributable to Continentals plans. Funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. We estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the Continental plans during calendar year 2012 is approximately $184 million. The fair value of the plans assets was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2011, of which $1.7 billion is attributed to assets of Continentals plans.  

The following discussion relates only to the Continental plans, as the United plans are not material.  

When calculating pension expense for 2012, Continental assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.  

The combined UAL defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. Return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity and hedge funds). Risk mitigating investments include primarily U.S. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. The allocation of assets was as follows at December 31, 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. When calculating pension expense for 2012, we assume that our plans assets will generate a weighted-average long-term rate of return of 7.75%. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by an additional 50 basis points (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase estimated 2012 pension expense by approximately $8 million.  

Future pension obligations for the Continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 5.13% at December 31, 2011. UAL selected the 2011 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2011 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments.  

UAL selected the 2011 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2011, that would provide the necessary cash flows to match projected benefit payments. Prior to 2011, the discount rate was selected using a cash flow matching technique where projected benefit payments were matched to a yield curve based on high quality bond yields as of the measurement date. This change increased the discount rate which lowered the present value of the liability by approximately $325 million.

This approach can result in different discount rates for different plans, depending on each plans projected benefit payments. The pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 5.13% to 4.63%) would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2011 by approximately $325 million and increase the estimated 2012 pension expense by approximately $41 million.  

Future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.  

Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting. Uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as Other Benefits. Continentals retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and Medicare eligibility. Eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. Plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles, and other limits as described in the plans.  

The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. Other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. The Company has not been required to pre-fund its current and future plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below.  

UALs benefit obligation was $2.54 billion and $2.49 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The year-over-year increase is due to changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for UALs plan, such as the decrease in the discount rate.  

The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. UAL determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. Uniteds weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011 was 4.93%, as compared to 5.15% for December 31, 2010. Continentals weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011 was 4.78%, as compared to 4.97% for December 31, 2010. The health care cost trend rate assumed by United and Continental for 2011 was 8% and 7.5%, respectively, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2012 of 7%. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in assumed health care trend rates would increase (decrease) UALs total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2011 by $21 million and $(18) million, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase UALs postretirement benefit liability by approximately $308 million and increase the estimated 2011 benefits expense by approximately $21 million.  

UAL selected the 2011 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2011 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments. Prior to 2011, the discount rate was selected using a cash flow matching technique where projected benefit payments were matched to a yield curve based on high quality bond yields as of the measurement date. This change increased the discount rate which lowered the present value of the liability by approximately $200 million.  

Detailed information regarding the Companys other postretirement plans, including key assumptions, is included in Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, those gains and  

62  

Table of Contents 

 losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. The Companys accounting policy for postretirement welfare benefit plans is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable GAAP with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the corridor approach, amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is required only if, at the beginning of the year, the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense. The corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in postretirement welfare benefit plan expense each year. Since the Company has elected not to apply the corridor approach, all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, UAL had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $33 million and $24 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  

Income Taxes  

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible. The Companys management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To form a conclusion, management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences, projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies, and negative evidence such as recent history of losses. Prior to 2011, the Company was in a cumulative three-year loss position, which we weighted as a significant source of negative evidence indicating the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. Although the Company was no longer in a three-year cumulative loss position at the end of 2011, management determined that the size and frequency of financial losses in recent years and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still needed on net deferred assets. If UAL achieves significant profitability in 2012, then management will evaluate whether its recent history of profitability constitutes sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of a portion, or all, of the remaining valuation allowance.
