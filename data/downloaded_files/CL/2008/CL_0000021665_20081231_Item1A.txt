ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

Set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities.  

We face risks associated with significant international operations.  

We operate on a global basis with approximately 75% of our net sales coming from markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Companys exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:  

       changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive from non-U.S. markets or increase our labor or supply costs in those markets,  

       exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas, which from time to time result in significant balances in countries such as Venezuela that are at risk for devaluation,  

       political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets,  

       lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where the Company operates,  

       foreign ownership restrictions and nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, and  

       foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions or other government controls.  

These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial condition. We monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign

 currency rate movements through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.  

We face risks associated with the current global credit crisis and economic downturn.  

The continuing volatility in the financial markets and the economic downturn in markets throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets have recently experienced significant disruptions and certain leading financial institutions have either declared bankruptcy or have shown significant deterioration in their financial stability. Further deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive. If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures. In addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, impact our business.  

In addition, although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, retailers may increase levels of promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during the economic downturn. Accordingly, the current economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.   

We face vigorous competition around the world, including from other large, multinational consumer product companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. We face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to:  

       the pricing of products,  

       promotional activities,  

       advertising, and  

       new product introductions.  

We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands, on whether we can attract and retain key talent, and on our ability to protect our patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.  

Changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business.  

Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing an increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and

 some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and other conditions. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices, are a potential source of competition for certain of our product lines.  

The growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products.  

Our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors. In addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can:  

       develop and fund technological innovations,  

       receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection,  

       obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products,  

       comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other governmental regulations, and  

       anticipate consumer needs and preferences successfully.  

The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our Company not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position.  

Rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability.  

Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, our move to global suppliers, for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. While we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials.   

Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.  

Maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our Ethics and Compliance, Sustainability, Brand Protection and Product Safety and Quality initiatives. In particular, adverse publicity about product safety or quality and similar types of concerns, real or imagined, or the allegations of product contamination or tampering, whether or not valid, may result in a product recall or reduced demand for our products. A significant product recall could tarnish the image of the affected brands and cause consumers to choose other products.

In addition, from time to time, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products. To the extent that third parties sell products that are counterfeit versions of our brands, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior, or that pose safety risks, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business.  

Similarly, adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns, our environmental impacts, including packaging, energy and water use and waste management, or other sustainability issues, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.  

Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.  

The manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of consumer products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad. This regulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:  

       in the U.S., our products and the manufacture of our products are subject to regulation and review and/or approval by the Food and Drug Administration as well as by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency;  

       also in the U.S., claims and advertising with respect to our products are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission;  

       we are also subject to regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture and sell our products and by state and local agencies in the U.S. that regulate in parallel to the above agencies; and  

       our selling practices are regulated by competition authorities in the U.S. and abroad.  

A finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. For information regarding our European competition matters, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

We have obtained all necessary regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell our currently marketed products. New or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations, however, could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in Europe, the U.S. and other countries conduct reviews of the use of triclosan in certain consumer products. In 2005, the FDA established an advisory panel to examine the use of certain anti-microbials, including triclosan, in anti-microbial hand soaps, wipes and hand sanitizers. Also, the European Commission (EC) is examining the use of triclosan in consumer products. A finding by the FDA, the EC or another overseas regulatory authority that triclosan should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be regulated could have an adverse impact on our business, as could negative reactions to triclosan from consumers, our trade customers or non-governmental organizations. Currently, Colgate uses triclosan in certain of its oral, personal and home care products, including Colgate Total toothpaste, Softsoap brand liquid hand soap and Protex bar soap.

Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities.  

As a company engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:  

       availability of key raw materials,  

       industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues,  

       environmental events,  

       strikes and other labor disputes,  

       disruptions in logistics,  

       loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,  

       raw material and product quality or safety issues,  

       counterfeit products,  

       licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, and  

       natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.  

While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, if our products, or raw materials contained in our products, are found or perceived to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products; our reputation and brand image could be diminished; and we could lose market share or become subject to liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.  

Our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our future operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business may be materially adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.  

The risks described above are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the above risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.
