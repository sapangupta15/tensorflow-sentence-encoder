PART I  

 ITEM 1.   BUSINESS    

Overview  

FedEx Corporation (FedEx) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four business segments:  

    FedEx Express: Federal Express Corporation (FedEx Express) is the worlds largest express transportation company, offering time-certain delivery within one to three business days and serving markets that comprise more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc., which provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, and FedEx SupplyChain Systems, Inc., which offers a range of supply chain solutions.    

    FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (FedEx Ground) is a leading provider of small-package ground delivery services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to every business address in the United States and Canada, as well as residential delivery to nearly 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. The FedEx Ground segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc., which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages using the U.S. Postal Service or Canada Post Corporation for final delivery to any residential address or PO Box in the United States and Canada.    

    FedEx Freight: FedEx Freight, Inc. (FedEx Freight) is a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services, offering: FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet supply chain needs; and FedEx Freight Economy, for less time-sensitive shipping at a lower cost. The FedEx Freight segment also offers freight delivery service throughout Canada and Mexico and includes FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., North Americas largest time-specific, critical shipment carrier.    

    FedEx Services: FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (FedEx Services) provides our other companies with sales, marketing and information technology support. The FedEx Services segment also includes FedEx TechConnect, Inc., which is responsible for customer service, billings and collections for our U.S. customers and offers technical support services, and FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (FedEx Office), which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services.

Strategy  

FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies. Through our holding company, we provide strategic direction to, and coordination of, the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services.  

We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our Web site, fedex.com, provides a single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment tracking, customer service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup and delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped.  

We manage our business as a portfolio  in the long-term best interest of the enterprise, not a particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively, all our management incentive compensation programs across the enterprise are tied to the performance of FedEx as a whole.  

While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise. Each companys operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment.  

Our compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate. For example, to accommodate recent and anticipated international growth at FedEx Express, we are adding flights, purchasing aircraft and improving services to and from Asia, Europe and Latin America based on the long-term growth prospects of these regions. We have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase a total of 45 Boeing 777 Freighter (B777F) aircraft, a new high-capacity, long-range airplane, 12 of which have already been delivered. We also hold options to purchase an additional 13 B777F aircraft. The B777F enables us to fly between major world markets with lower operating costs, more shipments and in less time than before, allowing later cut-off times for customers in these markets to drop off their shipments. In addition, we continue to expand network capacity at our growing FedEx Ground segment.  

4   
The following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace, and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term:  

    Globalization: As the worlds economy has become more fully integrated, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With customers in more than 220 countries and territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach, delivery services and information capabilities.    

    Supply Chain Acceleration: As global trade has grown, it has also become more fast-paced, and companies of all sizes now depend on the delivery of just-in-time inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward faster, more efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain near real-time information to manage inventory in motion, thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market.    

    Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses: High-tech and high-value-added goods have increased as a percentage of total economic output, and our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and high-value-added industries.    

    Growth of E-Commerce: E-commerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital growth engine for businesses, as the Internet is increasingly being used to purchase goods and services. Through our global transportation and technology networks, we contribute to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce.    

These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access  to goods, services and information. Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability. To this end, we are investing in long-term strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience, such as investments in B777F aircraft. We also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers. For example, in 2011, we:  

    Continued to reduce transit times within FedEx Grounds growing and highly profitable network.    

    Made a strategic acquisition in India and have one pending in Mexico, which will give us more robust domestic transportation and added capabilities in these important global markets.    

    Added more daily scheduled transpacific and transatlantic flights, providing needed capacity between Asia, Europe and the United States.    

    Expanded and enhanced FedEx First Overnight service (which offers next-business-day delivery as early as 8:00 a.m. depending on destination ZIP Code) and introduced FedEx First Overnight Freight (which offers early-morning delivery of critical air freight shipments) and FedEx 2Day A.M. service (which provides a 10:30 a.m. delivery commitment time for shipments with two-day delivery).   

5   
    Continued to execute our aggressive plan to expand the global freight forwarding presence of FedEx Trade Networks  by opening additional facilities (over three dozen new freight forwarding offices have already been opened) and establishing new alliances throughout the world.    

    Introduced an innovative end-to-end service for the shipping of temperature-sensitive healthcare products, such as pharmaceuticals, around the world.    

    Expanded FedEx Freights LTL freight service offerings, launching a new unified LTL network and offering customers the choice of two levels of reliable service from a single company: FedEx Freight Priority, the fast-transit choice for time-sensitive freight delivery; and FedEx Freight Economy, the economical choice for less time-sensitive freight delivery.    

Reputation and Responsibility  

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the worlds most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2011, FedEx ranked 8th in FORTUNE magazines Worlds Most Admired Companies list  the tenth consecutive year we have been ranked in the top 20 on the list.  

FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation, but also in global citizenship. We understand that a sustainable global business is tied to our global citizenship, and we are committed to connecting the world responsibly and resourcefully. Our latest published update to our inaugural global citizenship report is available at http://csr.fedex.com. These reports describe how we think about our responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and include important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities.  

Our People  

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. It is our people  our greatest asset  that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 290,000 team members who are absolutely, positively focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare. For additional information on our people-first philosophy and workplace initiatives, see http://csr.fedex.com.  

Our Community  

FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources and network. We provide financial contributions, in-kind charitable shipping services and volunteer efforts by our team members to help a variety of non-profit organizations achieve their goals and make a measurable impact on the world. We have three core focus areas: disaster preparedness, relief and recovery (American Red Cross, Salvation Army and Direct Relief Worldwide); child pedestrian safety (Safe Kids Worldwide); and environmental sustainability (EMBARQ and National Fish & Wildlife Foundation). We support minority access to higher education by funding scholarships, are a major sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum and also support Teach for America, Junior Achievement and St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. Additionally, we believe that the United Way of America offers one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting community needs and have supported the annual United Way fundraising campaign since 1975. For additional information on our community involvement and disaster relief efforts, see http://csr.fedex.com.  

6   
The Environment  

In furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment, we have set long-term goals to reduce aircraft emissions by 20 percent by 2020 on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis, increase FedEx Express vehicle efficiency by 20 percent by 2020, and expand on-site renewable energy generation and procurement of renewable energy credits. To meet our future operational needs, as discussed above, we are adding to our aircraft fleet the more fuel-efficient B777F and retiring and replacing older Boeing 727s with more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft is reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increasing our jet fuel efficiency. Our hybrid electric delivery fleet has logged more than nine million miles of revenue service. Our solar power generation systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability. In December 2010, the FedEx Express facility in Las Vegas, Nevada became our first FedEx facility to receive certification by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®), the U.S. Green Building Councils system for rating the environmental performance of buildings, and since then, our FedEx Express World Headquarters in Memphis and our enterprise data center in Colorado Springs, Colorado have received the same certification. FedEx Express has made LEED certification the standard for newly built U.S. facilities. We also continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of our packaging and copy and print services, and minimize waste generation through efforts that include recycling, pollution prevention and the use of copy paper with recycled content, among other environmentally-responsible available choices. For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see http://csr.fedex.com.  

Governance  

FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. During the past few years, we added a number of highly qualified, independent directors to the Board. The Board has taken significant steps to enhance its accountability to stockholders in recent years. For example, in 2011, the Board determined to submit to stockholders a proposal to amend FedExs certificate of incorporation in order to allow holders of 20 percent or more of FedExs common stock the right to call special meetings of stockholders, subject to certain customary conditions. Stockholders will vote on the proposed special meeting right at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held on September 26, 2011, and a full description of the proposal will be contained in FedExs definitive proxy statement for the meeting.  

Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site at http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations. We will post in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required.  

7   
Business Segments  

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments:  

FedEx Express Segment  

FedEx Express  

Overview  

FedEx Express invented express distribution in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through one integrated global network. FedEx Express offers time-definite delivery within one to three business days, serving markets that generate more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, with a money-back guarantee. FedEx Expresss unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the worlds largest express transportation company. FedEx Express employs approximately 143,000 employees and has approximately 57,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office centers), 688 aircraft and approximately 50,000 vehicles and trailers in its integrated global network.  

Services  

FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Overnight and deferred package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to nearly the entire United States population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services backed by money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the time-definite freight market.  

International express and deferred package delivery with a money-back guarantee is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, China, India and Mexico. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance.  

For information regarding FedEx Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology.  

International Expansion  

We recently made strategic moves in India and Mexico:  

    In February 2011, we acquired the Indian logistics, distribution and express businesses of AFL Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliate Unifreight India Pvt. Ltd.    

    On December 15, 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire Servicios Nacionales Mupa, S.A. de C.V. (MultiPack), a Mexican domestic express package delivery company, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2012.   

8   
These acquisitions will give us more robust domestic transportation networks and added capabilities in these important global markets, and are expected to provide important contributions to our long-term growth, productivity and profitability.  

We are focused on the long-term expansion of our international presence, especially in key markets such as China, India, Europe and Latin America. We began serving mainland China in 1984, and since that time, we have expanded our service to cover more than 400 cities across the country. Within the past few years, we have taken several important actions that bolster our presence there. As an example, in 2009, we began operations at our new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China. The new hub assumed and expanded the activities of our previous hub in Subic Bay, Philippines and better serves our global customers doing business in and with the China and Asia-Pacific markets.  

To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.  

U.S. Postal Service Agreement  

Under an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service that runs through September 2013, FedEx Express provides domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal Service, including for its First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately 5,000 drop boxes at U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery for the U.S. Postal Services international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed (GXG).  

Pricing  

FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. International rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size, weight, destination and, whenever applicable, whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced.  

FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of a certain spot price for jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2011 was based on the average spot price for jet fuel published for April 2011. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the average spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2011  10%; 2010  6%; and 2009  17%. These percentages include certain fuel surcharge reductions that are associated with our annual base rate increases.  

9   
Operations  

FedEx Expresss primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the companys multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, Fort Worth and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago.  

Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Guangzhou and Cologne/Bonn serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London, and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Guangzhou, Paris and Cologne/Bonn are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami  the Miami Gateway Hub  serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets.  

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the stations service area. In some international areas, independent agents (Global Service Participants) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption FedEx Express Segment.  

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, corporate or industrial parks and outside some U.S. Post Offices.  

Fuel Supplies and Costs  

During 2011, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See FedEx Express  Pricing.  

The following table sets forth FedEx Expresss costs for jet fuel and its percentage of consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Approximately 11% of FedEx Expresss requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The remainder of FedEx Expresss requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.  

Competition  

As described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors), the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings.  

10   
Competitors within the United States include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery concerns, air freight forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service. FedEx Expresss principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, TNT, other foreign postal authorities, freight forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Expresss international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express.  

Employees  

David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2011, FedEx Express employed approximately 95,000 permanent full-time and 48,000 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 15% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Expresss international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 27% of all employees.  

The pilots of FedEx Express, who constitute a small percentage of our total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the pilots ratified a new labor contract that includes safety initiatives, increases in hourly pay rates and travel per diem rates, and provisions for opening a European crew base. The new contract is scheduled to become amendable in March 2013 unless the union exercises its option to shorten the contract, in which case the agreement would be amendable in March 2012 and a portion of the hourly pay increases would be canceled.  

Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees. Certain of FedEx Expresss non-U.S. employees are unionized. FedEx Express believes its relationship with all of its employees is excellent.  

FedEx Trade Networks  

FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding. During 2011, FedEx Trade Networks continued to execute an aggressive plan to expand its global freight forwarding presence  by opening additional facilities (over three dozen new freight forwarding offices have already been opened) and establishing new alliances throughout the world. FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express at its major U.S. hub facilities. Value-added services include Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks publishes customs duty and tax information for over 100 customs areas worldwide. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 4,000 employees and 132 offices in 106 service locations throughout North America and in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. FedEx Trade Networks maintains a network of air and ocean freight-forwarding service providers and strategic alliances to provide services in certain countries in which it does not have owned offices.  

11   
FedEx SupplyChain Systems  

FedEx SupplyChain is an integrated logistics provider offering a range of supply chain solutions that leverage FedEx information technology and transportation networks around the world. The company offers services that include critical inventory logistics, transportation management and temperature-controlled transportation through a network of owned and managed resources  all tightly integrated via advanced information technology systems.  

FedEx Ground Segment  

FedEx Ground  

Overview  

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental United States population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental United States population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers.  

FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. For example, during the most recent two-year period, FedEx Ground has reduced the transit times of over 8,000 of its lanes. FedEx Grounds ongoing network expansion program is substantially increasing the companys daily pickup capacity through the addition of new hubs featuring the latest automated sorting technology, the expansion of existing hubs, and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities.  

The company offers FedEx Home Delivery, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.  

Pricing  

FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Ground contractor or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Office center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter.  

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2011 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April 2011. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.  

12   
Operations  

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 520 facilities, including 32 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 28,100 owner-operated vehicles and 32,600 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Deliverys operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.  

Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx Web site, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see FedEx Services  Technology.  

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.  

As of May 31, 2011, FedEx Ground had approximately 48,000 employees. In addition, FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers. David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS and the U.S. Postal Service.  

Evolution of Independent Contractor Model  

Although FedEx Ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as state tax audits or other administrative challenges) where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue, a number of recent judicial decisions have supported the companys classification of them and the company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors) and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with contractors that, among other things, provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the contractors. For example, FedEx Ground has implemented or is implementing its Independent Service Provider (ISP) model in a number of states. The ISP model requires pickup-and-delivery contractors based in those states to, among other things: (i) assume responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire geographic service area that includes multiple routes, and (ii) negotiate independent agreements with FedEx Ground, rather than agree to a standard contract.  

As of May 31, 2011, FedEx Ground has transitioned to the ISP model in Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, and plans to complete transition to the ISP model in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee during 2012. Based upon the success of this model, FedEx Ground may possibly transition to it in other states as well.  

13   
In addition, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx Ground only contracts with contractors that (i) are organized as corporations registered and in good standing under applicable state law, and (ii) ensure that their personnel who provide services under an operating agreement with FedEx Ground are treated as their employees. FedEx Ground also has an ongoing nationwide program to incentivize contractors who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. During May 2011, approximately 80% of FedEx Grounds package volume was delivered by multiple route owner-operators or independent service providers.

Trademarks  

The FedEx trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx SupplyChain Systems, FedEx TechConnect, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.  

Regulation  

Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.  

The FAAs regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.  

17   
In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for the pilots of FedEx Express, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. It is reasonably possible that these rules, if enacted as currently drafted, or other future flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.  

The DOTs authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOTs jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.  

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA has issued to us a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains many new and enhanced security requirements. These requirements are not static, but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, and to respond to evolving threats. Until these requirements are adopted, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.  

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Expresss wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for such charter flights.  

Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.  

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.  

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.  

18   
International. FedEx Expresss international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOTs approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments.  

Our operations outside of the United States, such as FedEx Expresss growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict, and sometimes prohibit, our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market. As an example, the Chinese government has adopted postal regulations that exclude foreign-owned companies such as FedEx from competing in the mainland China domestic document delivery market.  

Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Expresss activities pertaining to satellite communications.  

Environmental. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Expresss aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Expresss aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Expresss significant markets. Congresss passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Expresss international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.  

Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For example, during 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for GHG emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the European Union will be covered by the ETS requirements beginning in 2012, and each year we will be required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. For a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors).  

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Offices copy machines. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.  

Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.  

19   
Labor. All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the RLA), while labor relations within the United States at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the NLRA). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.  

The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.  

The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Risk Factors).
