ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

To limit our exposure to market risk, we principally finance our operations and growth with permanent equity capital consisting of retained operating cash flow, capital raised through the issuance of common shares and preferred shares. At December 31, 2010, our debt as a percentage of total equity (based on book values) was 6.5%. 

Our preferred shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders. These shares, however, are redeemable, after a set period of time, at our option. At December 31, 2010, our Series W, Series X, Series Y, Series Z, Series A, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F and Series G preferred shares are currently redeemable by us at our option. Under certain conditions relating to the Company’s qualification as a REIT, the preferred shares are not redeemable by the Company pursuant to its redemption option prior to the dates set forth in Note 8 to our December 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements. 

Our market-risk sensitive instruments include notes payable, which totaled $568,417,000 at December 31, 2010. 

We have foreign currency exposures related to our investment in Shurgard Europe, which has a book value of $264.7 million at December 31, 2010. We also have a loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, which is denominated in Euros, totaling €373.7 million ($495.2 million) at December 31, 2010. 

The table below summarizes annual debt maturities and weighted-average interest rates on our outstanding debt at the end of each year and fair values required to evaluate our expected cash-flows under debt agreements and our sensitivity to interest rate changes at December 31, 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands).
