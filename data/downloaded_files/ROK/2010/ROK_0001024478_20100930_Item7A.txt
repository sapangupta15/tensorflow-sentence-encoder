Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of $28.2 million and a liability of $20.4 million at September 30, 2010. We enter into these contracts with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.  

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to U.S. dollars. In 2010, the relative weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations, while in 2009 the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact. While future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to 2010 levels.  

Certain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. For such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts, a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre-tax income by approximately $15 million.  

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value in earnings immediately. The ineffective portion was not significant in 2010 and 2009. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk  

In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.  

Our short-term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. We had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings at September 30, 2010 and 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper borrowings was 0.6 percent during 2009. Due to the low level of variable-rate borrowings in 2010 and 2009, interest rate changes would not have had a material impact on interest expense.  

We had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with carrying values of $904.9 million at September 30, 2010 and $904.7 million at September 30, 2009. The fair value of this debt was $1,073.8 million at September 30, 2010 and $992.0 million at September 30, 2009. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity.
