ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview  

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate two casino resort complexes. In Las Vegas, Nevada, we own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort which opened on April 28, 2005. In December 2008, we expanded Wynn Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas as our Las Vegas Operations. In the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), we own and operate Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006. On April 21, 2010 we opened Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau as our Macau Operations.  

Our Resorts  

The following table sets forth information about our operating resorts as of February 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Wynn Las Vegas  

Wynn Las Vegas, located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. In addition, we own approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue, a portion of which is utilized for employee parking and approximately 5 acres adjacent to the golf course on which an office building is located.  

Wynn Las Vegas features:  

       An approximately 110,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book;  

       Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas;  

       22 food and beverage outlets;  

       A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership;  

       Approximately 74,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta, Vertu and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18-hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and a full service spa and salon; and  

       A showroom, two nightclubs and lounges.  

In July 2010, we commenced a project to refurbish and upgrade the rooms and suites at Wynn Las Vegas. The total project budget is approximately $83 million. The room remodel was completed in January 2011 and the suite remodel is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2011. As a part of this project, we are temporarily removing floors from service which reduces our total number of rooms available during the construction period.

In response to our evaluations and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.  

Future Development  

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this property in the future, we have no immediate plans to do so.  

We have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession on approximately 52 aces of land on Cotai and are awaiting final government approval on the concession. No construction timeline or budget has yet been developed.  

Results of Operations  

Our operating results in Macau were strong during 2010; however, reduced levels of consumer spending, high unemployment and increased hotel supply in the Las Vegas market have and may continue to adversely impact our financial results in Las Vegas. Our results for the years presented are not comparable as the year ended December 31, 2010 includes the operations of Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2009, includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas for a full year, whereas 2008 included only 10 days of operations for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands) are as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reliance on only two resort complexes (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes, many of our customers are high-end gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.  

Operating Measures  

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented. There are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry. In Las Vegas and in the general casino in Macau, customers primarily purchase gaming chips from gaming tables. The cash and net markers used to purchase the gaming chips from gaming tables are deposited in the gaming tables drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our Las Vegas Operations and in the general casino at our Macau Operations for calculating win percentage.  

In our VIP casino in Macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable rolling chips from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage. Non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the non-negotiable rolling  

38  

Table of Contents 

 chips in the VIP casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Because of this difference in chip purchase activity, the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the VIP casino. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP casino play using this Rolling Chip method.  

The measurement method in Las Vegas and in the general casino in Macau effectively tracks the initial purchase of chips while the measurement method in the VIP casino at Wynn Macau effectively tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement in the VIP casino is much larger than the general casino. As a result, the expected win percent with the same amount of gaming win (numerator) is smaller in the VIP casino in Macau when compared to the general casino in Las Vegas and Macau.  

Even though both use the same measurement method, we experience different win percentages in the general casino activity in Las Vegas versus Macau. This difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games between the two casinos. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. The life to date table games win percentage for our Las Vegas Operations is 22.0% whereas the life to date table games win percentage for the general casino at our Macau Operations is 20.8%.  

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:  

       Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.  

       Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box.  

       Turnover is the sum of all losing Rolling Chip wagers within our Macau VIP program.  

       Rolling Chips are identifiable chips that are used to track VIP wagering volume (turnover) for purposes of calculating incentives.  

       Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.  

       Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.  

       Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.  

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 are comprised of $3,245.1 million in casino revenues (77.5% of total net revenues) and $939.6 million of net non-casino revenues (22.5% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were comprised of $2,206.8 million in casino revenues (72.5% of total net revenues) and $838.8 million of net non-casino revenues (27.5% of total net revenues).  

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $3,245.1 million represents a $1,038.3 million (or 47%) increase from casino revenues of $2,206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  

Our Las Vegas Operations experienced a $28.5 million increase in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a 3.4% increase in drop and an increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 22.2% which was within the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 20.2% for the prior year. Slot handle at our Las Vegas Operations decreased 18.3% compared to the prior year; however slot win decreased only 6.9% as more play shifted to higher hold machines.

Table of Contents 

Casino revenues at our Macau Operations increased $1,009.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the prior year. We experienced a 77.8% increase in the VIP revenue segment due to a 68.0% increase in turnover. Our win as a percent of turnover was 3.0%, which is at the high end of the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%, and compares to 2.9% in the prior year. In November 2009 we added two new private gaming salons with 29 VIP tables and on April 21, 2010 we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau, which helped drive some of the growth in our VIP segment during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play. In our general casino, drop increased 17.4% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 23.6%, which is above the expected range of 19% to 21%. The average table game win percentage for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 21.9%. Slot handle increased 23.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau and slot win increased by 29.8%.  

For the year ended December 31, 2010, room revenues were approximately $400.3 million, an increase of $22.8 million compared to prior year room revenue of $377.5 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations decreased approximately $12.7 million compared to the prior year. In Las Vegas, we continued to experience a decrease in room rates during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. We believe this is due to the current economic conditions in which we operate in the U.S. and the increased capacity in the Las Vegas market including the opening of a new large scale casino hotel in Las Vegas in December 2009. In addition, in July 2010, we commenced a project to remodel all of the rooms at Wynn Las Vegas. Accordingly, we had 3.8% fewer room nights available during the year ended December 31, 2010 which had a negative impact on our room revenues in Las Vegas. This room remodel is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2011. Room revenue at our Macau Operations increased approximately $35.5 million due to the 414 additional suites added with Encore at Wynn Macau and an increase in the average daily room rate compared to the prior year.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $488.1 million, retail revenues of approximately $214.6 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $72 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $67.7 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $436.4 million, retail revenues of approximately $165.1 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $57.1 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $66.2 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased approximately $31.4 million, while our Macau Operations increased $20.3 million, as compared to the prior year. The increase in Las Vegas is due primarily to business in our nightclubs including the opening of the Encore Beach Club and Surrender nightclub in May 2010. The increase in Macau is primarily due to the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau and increased visitation to our resort. Retail revenues at our Macau Operations increased $52.2 million, offset by a  

40  

Table of Contents 

 decrease of $2.7 million in Las Vegas. The increase in Macau is due primarily to increased sales at several outlets, the opening of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry in November 2009, which sells Cartier and Jaeger Le Coultre products, and new outlets at Encore at Wynn Macau including Chanel, Piaget and Cartier. Entertainment revenues increased over the prior year primarily due to performances by Garth Brooks in the Encore Theater in Las Vegas which commenced in December 2009, as well as increased revenue from our Le Rêve show.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $2,100.1 million, room expenses of $122.3 million, food and beverage expenses of $272.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $204.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $391.3 million and approximately $28.3 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2009, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,460.1 million, room expenses of $111.6 million, food and beverage expenses of $252.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $166.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $365.1 million and approximately $13.7 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to an increase in casino revenues especially at our Macau Operations where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. Room expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased customer acquisition and marketing costs and the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau in April 2010. Food and beverage expenses increased commensurate with the increase in revenue.  

Entertainment, retail and other expense increased primarily as a result of performances by Garth Brooks in the Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas and increased retail sales in Macau as noted above. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher spending associated with corporate activities. The provision for doubtful accounts receivable increased $14.6 million due to an increase in credit issuances commensurate with the increase in business volume.  

Pre-opening costs  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $9.5 million of pre-opening costs compared to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily related to Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010 and the Encore Beach Club which opened in Las Vegas on May 28, 2010.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $405.6 million compared to $410.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This decrease is primarily due to assets with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of April 2010 at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by depreciation of the assets of Encore at Wynn Macau which were placed in to service in April 2010 and the assets of the Encore Beach Club which were placed in to service in May 2010.  

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at our Macau Operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to our Macau Operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $25.2 million compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010 include a contract termination payment of $14.9 million related to a management contract for certain of the nightclubs at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and gain/loss on sale of equipment at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009, include a $16.7 million charge for the abandonment of the front porte-cochere at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to make way for the Encore Beach Club, the write-off of $6.8 million of aircraft purchase deposits and $5 million related to miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and loss on sale of equipment.  

In response to our evaluation of our resorts and the reactions of our guests, we continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010 and 2009, our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments include primarily money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and time deposits with a purchase maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $222.9 million, net of capitalized interest of $7.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $211.4 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our interest expense increased approximately $11.5 million primarily due to (i) an increase of $33.2 million related to the Wynn Las Vegas $500 million 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes issued in October 2009, (ii) an increase of $8.9 million related to the increase in rate for the Wynn Las Vegas First Mortgage Notes as discussed below, and (iii) a decrease in interest capitalized of $3.5 million. These increases were offset partially by (i) a decrease of $16 million due to the payoff of the Wynn Resorts term loan in June 2009 and (ii) a decrease of $19.2 million related to reduced amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau bank revolving credit facilities compared to the prior year.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each year. We recorded an expense of approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we recorded an expense of $2.3 million resulting from the decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

In April 2010, we completed an exchange offer for a portion of the Wynn Las Vegas 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Notes). In connection with that exchange offer, the direct costs incurred with third parties of $4.6 million were expensed. Also, in connection with our July 2010 tender offer for the then outstanding 2014 Notes and subsequent call of all the remaining amounts once the tender was completed, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 63.3 million. This included the tender offer consideration, the call premium and the related write off of the unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount. These transactions are described in more detail in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

As a result of several debt retirements, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we purchased and retired outstanding loans of $375 million under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan Facility at a discounted price of 97.25%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue cost. During this same period, we purchased $65.8 million face amount of the  

42  

Table of Contents 

 2014 Notes through open market purchases at a discount. This transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.7 million, net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs. We participated in the April 2010 tender offer noted above with respect to $35.8 million of these notes and accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, Wynn Resorts holds $30 million of this debt which has not been contributed to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. For accounting purposes these notes were treated as having been extinguished by Wynn Resorts in 2009. In October 2009, we purchased loans through an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement, with a face-value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $2.1 million on early retirement of debt. Offsetting these gains was the write off of debt issue costs of approximately $5.9 million related to permanent reductions in our bank credit facility as described under Financing Activities below.  

Income Taxes  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a tax expense of $20.4 million. Our provision for income taxes is primarily comprised of increases in our foreign and domestic valuation allowances relating to foreign tax loss carryforwards, other foreign deferred tax assets and U.S. foreign tax credits not considered more likely than not realizable in the future. The tax provision recorded for the valuation allowance increases was reduced by an income tax benefit recorded for the loss from our U.S. operations. As of June 30, 2010, we no longer consider our portion of the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited to be permanently reinvested. No additional U.S. tax provision has been made with respect to this amount as we anticipate that U.S. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any U.S. tax provision relating to such repatriation. Prior to this change, our earnings attributable to periods after September 2009, were considered permanently reinvested abroad. The decrease in our current deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the repatriation of $1.14 billion of Wynn Macau, Limited IPO proceeds not considered permanently reinvested. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized income tax benefits related to excess tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation costs of $10.5 million.  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of $64.4 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau S.A. received an additional 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits to December 31, 2015.  

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Macau Finance Bureau commenced an examination of the 2006 and 2007 Macau income tax returns of Wynn Macau S.A. We believe that the examination of the 2006 Macau income tax return will likely conclude within the next 12 months; however, we are unable to provide a summary of the likely examination issues or the impact on unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2010, no significant issues have been brought to our attention and we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions recorded at Wynn Macau S.A. is adequate with respect to these years.  

During 2010, we reached an agreement with the Appellate division of the IRS regarding issues raised during the examination of our 2004 and 2005 U.S. income tax returns. The issues for consideration by the Appellate division were temporary differences and related to the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets. As a result of this settlement with the Appellate division, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $78.4 million. This reduction in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions of $55 million. The settlement of the 2004 and 2005 examination issues did not result in a cash tax payment but rather utilized $88.5 million and $2.5 million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards. The statute of limitations for the 2004 and 2005 U.S. income tax returns has been extended to September 30, 2011.

Table of Contents 

During 2010, we received the results of an IRS examination of our 2006 through 2008 U.S. income tax returns and filed an appeal of the examinations findings with the Appellate division of the IRS. In connection with that appeal, we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our 2006 and 2007 U.S. income tax returns to December 31, 2011. We believe that we will likely reach an agreement with the IRS with respect to the examination of these U.S. income tax returns within the next 12 months. The issues under examination in these years are temporary differences and relate to the treatment of discounts extended to Las Vegas casino customers gambling on credit, the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets. Upon the settlement of these issues, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $0 to $54 million. The resolution of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward.  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the IRS commenced an examination of our 2009 U.S. income tax return. Since the examination is in its initial stages, we are unable to determine if it will conclude within the next twelve months. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions related to the period covered by the examination is adequate. The resolution of the 2009 IRS examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of our 2009 foreign tax credit carryforward.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock through an initial public offering. We recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.5 million for the period October 9, 2009, the date of the initial public offering, to December 31, 2009.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008  

As noted earlier, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2008, as the year ended December 31, 2009 includes the operations of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened on December 22, 2008, whereas the prior year includes only 10 days of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 are comprised of $2,206.8 million in casino revenues (72.5% of total net revenues) and $838.8 million of net non-casino revenues (27.5% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were comprised of $2,261.9 million in casino revenues (75.7% of total net revenues) and $725.4 million of net non-casino revenues (24.3% of total net revenues).  

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $2,206.8 million represents a $55.1 million (or 2.4 %) decrease from casino revenues of $2,261.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expanded Wynn Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. Encore added approximately 90 table games and approximately 800 slot machines to our Las Vegas casino operations. Even with these additions in capacity, our Las Vegas Operations experienced only a 5.4% increase in casino revenues, from $479.7 million in 2008 to $505.8 million in 2009, due to an increase in drop of 1.2% and a slight increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 20.2%, which was below the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 20.0% for the prior year. Slot handle at our Las Vegas Operations decreased 2.5% during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%.

Casino revenues at Wynn Macau decreased $81.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the prior year. At Wynn Macau, we experienced an 8% decrease in the VIP revenue segment primarily due to a 2% decrease in turnover and a decrease in our win as a percent of turnover. Our win as a percent of turnover was 2.9%, which was within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%, and compares to 3.0% in 2008. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play in that segment. In our general casino at Wynn Macau, drop decreased 12.2% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 21.9%, which was above the expected range of 19% to 21%. The average table games win percentage in the general casino at Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 19.6%. Slot handle at Wynn Macau increased 12.7% compared to the prior year and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. The increase in slot handle was primarily due to the play of several high-end slot customers.  

For the year ended December 31, 2009, room revenues were approximately $377.5 million, an increase of $50.8 million compared to prior year room revenue of $326.7 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations increased approximately $52.6 million compared to the prior year due to the addition of 2,034 suites at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened December 22, 2008. In Las Vegas, we continued to experience a significant decrease in occupancy and room rates during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Room revenue at Wynn Macau decreased approximately $1.8 million due to a decrease in room rates compared to the prior year.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 include food and beverage revenues of approximately $436.4 million, retail revenues of approximately $165.1 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $57.1 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $66.2 million. Other non-gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 include food and beverage revenues of approximately $358.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $147.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.2 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $56 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, including a new night club, which opened in December 2008, offset by a decrease of $2.4 million at Wynn Macau, as compared to the prior year. Although we added new retail outlets at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, overall retail revenues in Las Vegas were flat. Retail revenues at Wynn Macau increased approximately $16.9 million due primarily to increased sales at several retail outlets and the opening of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry, which sells Cartier, Jaeger Le Coultre, and Kwiat products. Entertainment revenues decreased over the prior year primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show at Wynn Las Vegas in July 2008. This decrease was offset in part by revenue from headliner acts that performed during 2009, including Garth Brooks, who began performing in the Encore Theater in December 2009.

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, departmental expenses include casino expense of $1,460.1 million, rooms expense of $111.6 million, food and beverage expense of $252.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expense of $166.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $365.1 million and approximately $13.7 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2008, departmental expenses include casino expenses of $1,490.9 million, room expenses of $78.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $207.3 million, and entertainment and retail and other expenses of $161.9 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $319.3 million and approximately $49.4 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a decrease in casino revenues especially at Wynn Macau where a gaming tax of 39% is the significant driver of expense in that department. Room, food and beverage and general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. Entertainment, retail and other expense increased primarily in the entertainment department due to headliner performances during the year. Our provision for doubtful accounts receivable declined during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the prior year due to recent strong collection trends on our casino accounts receivable. This strength has allowed us to reduce the additional reserves we recorded in the third quarter of 2008.  

Pre-opening costs  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred pre-opening costs of $1.8 million compared to $72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 were related to Encore at Wynn Macau. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 were related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened in December 2008.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009, of $410.5 million increased by $147.3 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to depreciation of the assets of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which were placed into service in December 2008.  

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations are capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $28.5 million compared to approximately $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $16.7 million charge for the abandonment of the front porte-cochere at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to make way for the Encore Beach Club, a $6.8 million charge for the write-off of 2 aircraft deposits and a $5 million charge related to miscellaneous remodels, abandonments and loss on sale of equipment.

Table of Contents 

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 include $17.8 million of costs associated with Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas which closed in July 2008. The costs included the production rights that were included in intangible assets, show production costs that were included in other assets and certain other property and equipment. In 2008, we also incurred a $3.6 million charge at Wynn Macau related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space to begin construction of a new restaurant. The remaining property charges during 2008 were related to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.  

We expect to continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest income decreased $19.8 million primarily due to a significant decrease in the average interest rates earned on invested cash balances compared to the prior year. During 2009, our short-term investment strategy was primarily to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments were primarily in investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $211.4 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $172.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $87.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our interest expense increased due to (i) $76.7 million less of capitalized interest related to our construction activities with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008, (ii) approximately $8.4 million of interest related to the 7 7/8% $500 million First Mortgage Notes issued in October 2009, (iii) approximately $3.9 million of interest related to additional borrowings on our Wynn Macau credit facilities during the year and (iv) approximately $0.6 million of interest associated with increased interest rates on the Wynn Las Vegas revolver. These increases were offset by (i) approximately $38.6 million less interest due to the November 2008 paydown of the Wynn Resorts term loan, as well as the subsequent $375 million payoff of such term loan in June 2009, (ii) approximately $3 million less interest related to the purchase of $65.8 million of 2014 Notes and (iii) approximately $9.3 million less interest due to lower average interest rates on the remainder of our debt including the expiration of the Wynn Las Vegas interest rate swap in December 2008.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each year. We recorded an expense of approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we recorded an expense of $31.5 million resulting from the net decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

As a result of several debt retirements, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, we purchased and retired outstanding loans of $375 million under the Wynn Resorts term loan at a discounted price of 97.25%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue cost. We purchased $65.8 million face amount of the 2014 Notes through open market purchases at a discount. This transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.7 million, net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs. As of December 31, 2009, Wynn Resorts holds this debt and has not contributed it to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. However, for accounting purposes this transaction has been treated as an extinguishment of debt by Wynn Resorts. In October 2009, we purchased loans through an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement, with a face-value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.1 million on early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Income Taxes  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a tax expense of $3.0 million. Our provision for income taxes primarily relates to an increase in a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits resulting from the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds. As discussed in our footnote on income taxes (Note 15), we currently do not consider forecasted future operating results when scheduling the realization of deferred tax assets and the required valuation allowance but instead rely solely on the reversal of net taxable temporary differences. The ultimate realization of our recorded foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is dependent upon the incurrence of sufficient U.S. income tax liabilities attributable to foreign source income during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.  

As of December 31, 2009, we have provided deferred income taxes net of foreign tax credits on the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds (Note 13) planned for repatriation. No deferred income taxes have been provided for earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a tax benefit of $61.6 million primarily associated with foreign tax credits applicable to earnings not considered permanently invested abroad. As of December 31, 2008, none of our foreign earnings were considered permanently invested abroad.  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of $31.7 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. In June 2009, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into an agreement with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provides for an annual payment of MOP $7.2 million (approximately $900,000 US dollars) to the Macau Special Administrative Region as complementary tax due by shareholders of Wynn Macau S.A. on dividend distributions. This agreement is effective as of 2006. Therefore, included in the tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009, are the amounts related to the years 2006 through 2009 totaling $3.6 million. This agreement on dividends is effective through 2010.  

In February 2010, we entered into a Pre-Filing Agreement (PFA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) providing that the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax and can be claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit. In January 2010, the IRS commenced an examination of the companys 2006, 2007, and 2008 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received the results of an IRS examination of our 2004 and 2005 tax returns and we filed an appeal of the examinations findings. In connection with that appeal, we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our 2004 and 2005 tax returns to March 15, 2011. We do not expect resolution of the findings within 12 months. We believe that our liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to the examinations findings are adequate. The resolution of the 2004 and 2005 IRS examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of our 2008 foreign tax credit carryforward.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, had its ordinary shares of common stock listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 (27.7%) shares of its common stock through an initial public offering. The $18.5 million represents the noncontrolling interests share of our net income for the period from October 9, 2009, the date of the IPO, through December 31, 2009.

Adjusted Property EBITDA  

Adjusted property EBITDA is used by us to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. We use adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors. We also present adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA. Also, our calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  

The following table summarizes adjusted property EBITDA for our domestic (Wynn Las Vegas) and foreign (Wynn Macau) operations as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementNote 17 Segment Information. That footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property EBITDA to net income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During the past three years we have experienced disparity between our domestic (Las Vegas) and our foreign (Macau) operations. Adjusted property EBITDA has grown at our Macau operations, while we have experienced little variance in Las Vegas. This disparity is a direct result of the factors that have impacted the global economy, especially the United States. Demand in Las Vegas has been flat while demand in Macau has steadily increased. During 2010, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in Las Vegas continued to experience depressed levels of gaming revenue, visitation and hotel room demand. While certain gaming and hotel statistics have increased from 2009 levels, improvement has not been significant. The average daily room rate increased 2%, visitation increased 2.7% to 37.3 million visitors, and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenues increased 4.5%, all as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in Las Vegas experienced declines including among other things, a 3% decrease in visitation, a 9.4% decrease in Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue and a 22% decrease in average daily room rates, all as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. While our customers in the United States have greatly reduced their spending levels due to weakness in the overall economy, increases in unemployment and weak consumer confidence, our customer base in Macau has not been impacted as much by such economic factors.  

49  

Table of Contents 

Also contributing to this decrease in the Wynn Las Vegas adjusted property EBITDA from 2008 to 2009 was the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. While we added significant capacity to our Las Vegas operations, we experienced a relatively small increase in revenues due to the factors noted herein, but we also incurred significant additional operating expenses. Our Macau adjusted property EBITDA has increased as that market continues to grow and as we have expanded our resort. Revenues in 2009 declined slightly, however our operating expenses decreased at a greater rate due primarily to cost savings initiatives implemented during 2009. Refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flow from Operations  

Our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our Las Vegas and Macau resorts (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. Our table games play both in Macau and Las Vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. A significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of high-end international customers that gamble on credit. The ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. Our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. Accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables.  

Net cash provided from operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.1 billion compared to $594 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase is primarily due to the increase in operating income as a result of increased casino, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other department profitability especially from our Macau casino operations as discussed above. Cash flow from operations also benefited from a reduction in cash paid for interest and an increase from ordinary working capital changes.  

Capital Resources  

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $1.26 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations, debt service and retirement, development activities, general corporate purposes and enhancements to our resorts. Approximately $662.6 million of our cash balance is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. and Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $327.2 million of availability under our Wynn Las Vegas Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $900 million of availability under our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Debt maturities in 2011 are $2.7 million, excluding $74.1 million of the Wynn Macau Term Loan that we have presented as a long-term liability as we have both the intent and ability to refinance this maturity with borrowings under the Wynn Macau Revolver. We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2011. If any additional financing became necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.  

Cash and cash equivalents include investments in money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and bank time deposits, all with maturities of less than 90 days.  

Investing Activities  

Capital expenditures were approximately $283.8 million, $540.9 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to the construction cost associated with Encore at Wynn Macau, which opened in April 2010, the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub, which opened in May 2010 and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened in December 2008.

Financing Activities  

Wynn Las Vegas First Mortgage Notes  

In October 2009, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (the Issuers), our wholly-owned subsidiaries, issued in a private offering, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due November 1, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) at a price of 97.823% of the principal amount. The Issuers pay interest on the 2017 Notes on May 1st and November 1st of each year. Commencing November 1, 2013, the 2017 Notes are redeemable at our option at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on November 1st of each year thereafter to zero on or after November 1, 2015. The 2017 Notes rank pari passu with the borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities and the outstanding first mortgage notes previously issued by the Issuers. The notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, are guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries (subject to some exceptions), and are secured on an equal and ratable basis by a first priority lien on substantially all the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors. In accordance with the fifth amendment to the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement described below, we used the proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan.  

On March 26, 2010, the Issuers commenced an offer to exchange all outstanding 2014 Notes for 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an offering memorandum and a related letter of transmittal (the exchange offer). The exchange offer was conditioned upon, among other things, the tender of at least $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes. The 2020 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers and outside the United States in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S, respectively, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The exchange offer closed on April 28, 2010 with approximately $352 million of the 2014 Notes being validly tendered for exchange to the 2020 Notes.  

The Issuers pay interest on the 2020 Notes on May 1st and November 1st of each year. Commencing May 1, 2015, the 2020 Notes are redeemable at our option at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on May 1st of each year thereafter to zero on or after May 1, 2018. The 2020 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities and 2017 Notes. The 2020 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by certain of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries and secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors and, subject to approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, a first priority lien on the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities and the 2017 Notes.  

The noteholders who validly tendered 2014 Notes prior to the early delivery time received an early delivery payment on April 28, 2010 of 1% of the amount tendered in cash, which totaled approximately $3.5 million. In accordance with accounting standards, this has been included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the life of the 2020 Notes. The direct costs of the exchange offer incurred with third parties of $4.6 million were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  

On August 4, 2010, the Issuers issued $1.32 billion aggregate principal amount of 7 3/4% First Mortgage Notes due August 15, 2020 (the New 2020 Notes). The New 2020 Notes were issued at par. The New 2020 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers and outside the United States in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S, respectively, under the Securities Act. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC used the net proceeds of the offering along with the proceeds of a $50 million capital contribution from Wynn Resorts, Limited to purchase, and, as applicable, make consent payments for, any and all of the Issuers 2014 Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs concurrent offer to purchase and consent solicitation with respect to the 2014 Notes, and to redeem all of the 2014 Notes not tendered. On or prior to August 3, 2010, valid tenders had been received with respect to approximately $951.3 million of the $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes outstanding. On August 4, 2010, tendering holders received the tender  

51  

Table of Contents 

 offer consideration in the amount of $1,004.38, plus a consent payment of $30 for each $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes, which totaled $32.7 million. The consent solicitation expired on August 3, 2010 and the tender offer expired on August 18, 2010. In accordance with accounting standards the consideration and consent fees were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  

On August 4, 2010, the Trustee, at the request of the Issuers, gave notice of redemption of any and all of the remaining 2014 Notes. The redemption price was equal to 103.313% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to September 3, 2010. The total redemption fees paid were $10.9 million. In accordance with accounting standards, the redemption fees were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Also in connection with this transaction, unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount related to the 2014 Notes totaling $18.4 million were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  

The Issuers pay interest on the New 2020 Notes on February 15th and August 15th of each year. Commencing August 15, 2015, the New 2020 Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at a price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on August 15th of each year thereafter to zero on or after August 15, 2018. The New 2020 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes. The New 2020 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by certain of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries and secured on an equal and ratable basis (with certain exceptions) by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors, and, subject to prior approval from the Nevada gaming authorities, a first priority lien on the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes.  

Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities  

Concurrently with the issuance of the New 2020 Notes, Wynn Las Vegas entered into a seventh amendment, dated August 4, 2010, to the Wynn Las Vegas Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). After giving effect to this amendment, the maturity date with respect to a portion of the revolving credit facility and the term facility was extended to July 2015 and August 2015, respectively, and the interest margin in respect of the extended portion will increase after June 30, 2013. In addition, lenders made incremental term loans of $248.5 million having a maturity date of August 2015. The amendment made certain other changes including eliminating the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and reducing the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio to 1:00 to 1 through June 2013.  

As of December 31, 2010, our Credit Agreement consisted of a $108.5 million revolving credit facility, due July 2013 and a $258.4 million revolving credit facility due July 2015 (together the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver), and a fully drawn $44.3 million term loan facility due August 2013 and a fully drawn $330.6 million term loan facility due August 2015 (together the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan). As of December 31, 2010, the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was fully drawn and we had borrowed $20.1 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We also had $19.7 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We have availability of approximately $327.2 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver as of December 31, 2010.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan and Revolver are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the 2017 Notes, the 2020 Notes and the New 2020 Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

As described below, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we (a) extended the maturity of the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver to July 2013, (b) received relief from certain financial covenants, (c) increased the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver by $65 million, (d) repurchased $87.6 million of Wynn Las Vegas Revolver loans at a discount, and (e) used the net proceeds received from our $500 million 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes issuance to repay amounts outstanding, including a permanent reduction of $360 million.  

In April 2009, we entered into a fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment, among other things, (i) provides a waiver of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, until the quarter ending June 30, 2011, and increases such thresholds thereafter; (ii) provides additional flexibility with our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, by reducing such ratio from 1.75 : 1 to 1.25 : 1 beginning June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2011; and (iii) removes the dollar limit on the equity cure provisions for the purpose of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio over the life of the loan. In exchange for the amendments, we (i) repaid 30% of the outstanding revolver loans of lenders consenting to the extension of their commitment (approximately $238 million) and permanently reduced such lender commitments by 25%; and (ii) agreed to an increase in the interest rate spread on the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver from LIBOR plus 1.625% to LIBOR plus 3.0%.  

In August 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we expanded the availability of the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver by $65 million.  

In September 2009, we entered into a fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment, among other things, (i) permitted Wynn Las Vegas to issue, on or before March 31, 2010, up to $500 million of new senior secured notes and (ii) requires that 75% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance of new senior secured notes be applied to prepay loans and reduce commitments under the Credit Agreement.  

In October 2009, pursuant to an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we purchased loans with a face value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. As a result of this transaction, the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver was permanently reduced by $43.8 million and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was permanently reduced by $44.8 million.  

For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 3.0% on the outstanding balance. We also incur a fee of 1.0% on the daily average of unborrowed amounts. For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.875% on the term loan due 2013 and 3% on the term loan due 2015.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement contains a requirement that we must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If our Wynn Las Vegas subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of greater than 3.5 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 3.5 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on the current economic conditions in which we are operating, we do not believe that Wynn Las Vegas will have excess cash flow for mandatory repayment pursuant to this provision of the Credit Agreement during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, and therefore we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2011.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the ability to sell assets, make capital expenditures, enter into capital leases, make loans or other investments and incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we are required by the financial covenants to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 1.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2010. Management believes that we are in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010.

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities  

As of December 31, 2010, our Wynn Macau credit facilities, as amended, consisted of a $550 million equivalent fully-funded senior term loan facility (the Wynn Macau Term Loan), and a $1 billion equivalent senior revolving credit facility (the Wynn Macau Revolver) in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars (together the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement. As of December 31, 2010, the Wynn Macau Term Loan was fully drawn and we had borrowed $100.2 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver. Consequently, we have approximately $900 million of availability as of December 31, 2010.  

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) plus a margin which was 1.75% through September 30, 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on Wynn Macaus leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. At December 31, 2010 the margin was 1.25% to 1.75%.  

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that Wynn Macau must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If our Wynn Macau subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 4.0 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on current estimates we do not believe that our Consolidated Leverage Ratio during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 will exceed 4.0 to 1, and therefore we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2011.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, we are required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of not greater than 4.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2010, and Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, of not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that we are in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010. Both the Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio requirements remain at not greater than 4.00 to 1 and not less than 2.00 to 1, respectively, for each reporting period during 2011.  

Wynn Resorts, Limited  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock. We received proceeds, net of related costs, of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of this transaction.  

In March 2009, we completed a secondary common stock offering of approximately 11 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $202.3 million. In November 2008, we completed a secondary common stock offering of 8 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $344.3 million.

In June 2009, we purchased and retired the remaining $375 million of outstanding loans from the $1 billion term loan we borrowed in June 2007, for the primary purpose of funding our equity repurchase program. The purchase price was $364.7 million reflecting a discounted price of 97.25%. In November 2008, we purchased and retired $625 million of this term loan. The purchase price was $596.1 million, reflecting a discounted price of 95.375%.  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we purchased $65.8 million face amount of the 2014 Notes through open market purchases for $50 million, reflecting a discounted price of 76.1%. As of December 31, 2009, we held this debt and had not contributed it to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. For accounting purposes, this transaction was treated as an extinguishment of debt by Wynn Resorts in 2009. As part of the March 2010 exchange offer discussed above, Wynn Resorts exchanged $30 million of its 2014 Notes for the 2020 Notes. The remaining $35.8 million were redeemed as part of the tender offer and redemption of all of the 2014 Notes in August 2010 as described above. As of December 31, 2010, Wynn Resorts holds $30 million of the 2020 Notes which have not been contributed to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas.  

On December 7, 2010, we paid a cash dividend of $8 per share.  

On each of May 26, 2010 and August 26, 2010, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share.  

On December 3, 2009, we paid a cash dividend of $4.00 per share.  

Our Board of Directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. No share repurchases were made during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 10,915,633 shares at a net cost of $940.1 million and during the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 1,889,321 shares at a net cost of $179.2 million. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, we had repurchased a total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $19.7 million.  

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2010 (amounts in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2010. Such rates are at historical lows as of December 31, 2010. Actual rates will vary.  

 [2] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for an aircraft purchase, fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 15 Income Taxes, of this report, we had $83.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2010.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau debt instruments significantly restrict our ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing the 2017 Notes, the 2020 Notes and the New 2020 Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indentures. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The Wynn Las Vegas, LLC Credit Facilities contain similar restrictions. While the Wynn Macau Credit Facility contains similar restrictions, Wynn Macau is currently in compliance with all requirements, namely satisfaction of its leverage ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.  

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We cannot assure you; however, that our Las Vegas operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Macau Revolver. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.  

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.  

Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self-insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.  

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates  

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.  

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our resorts, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets.  

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.  

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the land concession or the gaming concession which currently expires in June 2022, as applicable. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income.  

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our Las Vegas Operations. While offered, the issuance of credit at our Macau Operations is less significant when compared to Las Vegas. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.  

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.  

As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, approximately 82% and 76% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries.  

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply industry standard reserve percentages to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customers financial condition, collection history and any other known information. The standard reserve percentages applied are based on our historical experience and take into consideration current industry and economic conditions.  

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 35% and 27% respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.  

At December 31, 2010, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.6 million.  

58  

Table of Contents 

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a regions economy or legal system.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. As of December 31, 2010, changes in our interest rate swap fair values are being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.  

We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. Accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. We categorize our interest rate swap contracts as Level 2. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

Accounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments we issue. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.  

The expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. We estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. For example, a 10% change in the volatility assumption for 2010 would have resulted in an approximate $0.6 million change in fair value. Expected term represents the estimated average time between the options grant date and its exercise date. Because of our limited trading history as a public company we have elected to use the simplified method prescribed by applicable accounting standards, for companies with a limited trading history to estimate the expected term. Once we have sufficient trading history, we will estimate the expected term using historical experience for options that have been granted to employees within our stock option plan. A 10% change in the expected term assumption for 2010 would have resulted in an approximate $0.2 million change in fair value. These assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.  

59  

Table of Contents 

Accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).  

Self-Insurance Reserves  

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs of employee health coverage, workers compensation and general liability claims. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. In estimating these accruals, we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected level of costs per claim. Management believes the estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon its methodology; however, changes in health care costs, accident frequency and severity could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities.  

Customer Loyalty Program  

Our customer loyalty program relates to a slot club program whereby customers may earn points based on their level of play that may be redeemed for free credit that must be replayed in the slot machine. We accrue a liability based on the points earned times the redemption value, less an estimate for breakage, and record a related reduction in casino revenue.  

Slot Machine Jackpots  

With respect to base and progressive jackpots, we do not accrue a liability in jurisdictions in which we have the ability to avoid payment of the base jackpot because the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Conversely, if we are unable to avoid payment of the jackpot (i.e. the incremental amount on a progressive machine) due to legal requirements, the jackpot is accrued as the obligation becomes unavoidable. This liability is accrued over the time period in which the incremental progressive jackpot amount is generated with a related reduction in casino revenue. No liability is accrued with respect to the base jackpot.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.  

As of December 31, 2010, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $1,307 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $1,246 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. The U.S. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of net foreign source income. Due to our current operating history of U.S. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the utilization of the foreign tax credits. The estimated future foreign tax credit realization was based upon the estimated future taxable income from the reversal of net U.S. taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. The amount of the valuation allowance is subject to change based upon the actual reversal of temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  

Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in accounting for income taxes (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).  

Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.  

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2010 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $64.4 million in such taxes. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau received an additional 5 year exemption to December 31, 2015 related to this tax. Wynn Macaus non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.
