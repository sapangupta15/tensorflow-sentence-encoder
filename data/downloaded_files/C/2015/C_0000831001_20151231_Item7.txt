MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Citi’s full year 2015 results of operations reflected a solid overall performance. As described in more detail throughout this Executive Summary, Citi’s full year 2015 net income of $17.1 billion was its highest since pre-financial crisis, when Citi was a very different company in terms of footprint, mix of businesses and assets. During the year, Citi was able to grow revenues by 3% and make investments in its core Citicorp businesses while reducing its overall expenses, thus improving its overall efficiency ratio. Loan and deposit growth in Citicorp each grew by 5% while Citi’s overall balance sheet decreased by 3% (each excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation)). Citi also ended 2015 with a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, on a fully implemented basis, of 12.1%.

In addition to these accomplishments, Citi made significant progress on its execution priorities during 2015, including:

•Efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management: As described above, Citi maintained disciplined expense management during 2015, even as it continued to absorb increased regulatory and compliance costs in Citicorp and made ongoing business investments. Citi’s expense management during 2015 was further aided by lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning expenses in Citicorp as compared to the prior year, as discussed further below. 

•Continued wind down of Citi Holdings, while maintaining profitability: Citi significantly reduced the assets in Citi Holdings during the year. Citi Holdings’ assets decreased $55 billion, or 43%, from 2014, ending the year at $74 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Citi had executed agreements to further reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by approximately $7 billion in 2016 (for additional information, see “Citi Holdings” below). As discussed further below, Citi Holdings also maintained profitability in 2015.

•Utilization of deferred tax assets (DTAs): Citi utilized approximately $1.5 billion in DTAs during 2015 (for additional information, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Citi was able to achieve these results and make ongoing progress on its execution priorities during a year with market volatility and uncertainties, including macroeconomic uncertainties, slower global growth and market volatility resulting from, among other things, lower commodity prices as well as uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of U.S. interest rate changes. 

As the year-to-date has shown, Citi expects the operating environment in 2016 to remain challenging, with many of the uncertainties impacting its results of operations during 2015 

continuing into 2016. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2016, see each respective business’ results of operations, “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk” below. While Citi may not be able to control all aspects of its operating environment in 2016, it intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2015 by remaining focused on its execution priorities and target client strategy.

2015 Summary Results

Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $17.2 billion or $5.40 per share, compared to $7.3 billion or $2.20 per share in the prior year. Results in 2015 included $254 million ($162 million after-tax) of CVA/DVA, compared to negative $390 million (negative $240 million after-tax) in 2014. Citigroup full year 2014 results also included a charge of $3.8 billion ($3.7 billion after-tax) to settle RMBS and CDO-related claims recorded in Citi Holdings and a tax charge of $210 million related to corporate tax reforms recorded in Corporate/Other. 

Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA in both periods as well as the impact of the mortgage settlement and the tax item in 2014, Citigroup reported net income of $17.1 billion in 2015, or $5.35 per share, compared to $11.5 billion, or $3.55 per share, in the prior year. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of CVA/DVA as well as the impact of the mortgage settlement and the tax item in 2014 are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results

of operations excluding these impacts provides a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) The 49% increase from the prior year was primarily driven by lower expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by lower revenues and a reduced net loan loss reserve release. 

Citi’s revenues were $76.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of 1% from the prior year. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues were $76.1 billion, down 2% from the prior year, as Citicorp revenues decreased by 2% and Citi Holdings revenues decreased 1%. Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of FX translation, Citigroup revenues increased 3% from the prior year, driven by an increase of 3% in both Citicorp and Citi Holdings’ revenues. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation provides a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)

Expenses

Citigroup expenses decreased 21% versus the prior year to $43.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, Citigroup expenses declined 15% driven by significantly lower legal and related expenses ($1.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion in the prior year) and 

5

repositioning costs ($472 million compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year), as well as the impact of FX translation (which lowered expenses by approximately $2.6 billion in 2015 compared to the prior year). Excluding the impact of both the mortgage settlement in the prior year and FX translation, Citigroup’s expenses declined 10%, mainly driven by the lower legal and related expenses and repositioning costs.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, which lowered reported expenses by approximately $2.4 billion in 2015 compared to the prior year, Citicorp expenses decreased 9% also driven by significantly lower legal and related expenses and repositioning costs. Citicorp expenses in 2015 included legal and related expenses of $1.1 billion, compared to $4.8 billion in the prior year, and $278 million of repositioning costs, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year.

Citi Holdings’ expenses were $4.6 billion, down 52% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, Citi Holdings’ expenses decreased 22%, primarily driven by the ongoing decline in Citi Holdings assets as well as lower legal and related expenses. 

Credit Costs 

Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.9 billion increased 6% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased 7% as a lower net loan loss reserve release was partially offset by lower net credit losses. 

Net credit losses of $7.3 billion declined 19% versus the prior year. Consumer net credit losses declined 19% to $7.1 billion, mostly reflecting continued improvements in North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services in Citicorp as well as the North America mortgage portfolio within Citi Holdings. Corporate net credit losses declined 19% to $234 million. As previously disclosed, corporate net credit losses in 2014 included approximately $165 million of net credit losses related to the Pemex supplier program in Mexico (for additional information, see “Institutional Clients Group” below). Excluding these net credit losses in the prior year, net credit losses increased by approximately $111 million, primarily related to a limited number of energy and energy-related corporate loans, predominantly incurred during the latter part of 2015 (for additional information, see “Institutional Clients Group” and “Credit Risk—Corporate Credit” below). 

The net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $120 million in 2015, compared to a $2.4 billion release in 2014, excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year. Citicorp’s net reserve build was $409 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve release of $1.4 billion in 2014. The build in 2015 was primarily driven by net loan loss reserve builds in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) during the latter part of 2015, including approximately $530 million for energy and energy-related exposures. Overall, Citi expects its credit costs in Citicorp will likely be higher in 2016 as compared to 2015 given that it believes the vast majority of its net loan loss reserve releases have occurred as credit quality has largely stabilized.

Citi Holdings’ net reserve release, excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, decreased $443 million from the prior year to $529 million, primarily reflecting lower net releases related to the North America mortgage portfolio.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see “Credit Risk” below. 

Capital

Citi continued to grow its regulatory capital during 2015, even as it returned approximately $5.9 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends. Citigroup’s Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 13.5% and 12.1% as of December 31, 2015, respectively, compared to 11.5% and 10.6% as of December 31, 2014 (all based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2015, on a fully implemented basis, was 7.1%, compared to 5.9% as of December 31, 2014. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, including the impact of Citi’s DTAs on its capital ratios, see “Capital Resources” below.

Citicorp

Citicorp net income increased 50% from the prior year to $16.2 billion. CVA/DVA, recorded in ICG, was $269 million ($172 million after-tax) in 2015, compared to negative $343 million (negative $211 million after-tax) in the prior year (for a summary of CVA/DVA by business within ICG, see “Institutional Clients Group” below). Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the tax item in 2014, Citicorp’s net income was $16.0 billion, up 43% from the prior year, primarily driven by the lower expenses and net credit losses, partially offset by lower revenues and the net loan loss reserve builds.

Citicorp revenues decreased 1% from the prior year to $68.5 billion. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $68.2 billion in 2015, down 2% from the prior year, reflecting largely unchanged revenues in ICG and a 6% decrease in Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues. As referenced above, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of FX translation, Citicorp’s revenues grew 3%.

GCB revenues of $33.9 billion decreased 6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, GCB revenues decreased 1%, as decreases in North America GCB and Asia GCB were partially offset by an increase in Latin America GCB. North America GCB revenues decreased 1% to $19.4 billion, as lower revenues in Citi-branded cards were partially offset by higher retail banking revenues. Citi-branded cards revenues of $7.8 billion were down 6% versus the prior year, reflecting the continued impact of lower average loans as well as an increase in acquisition and rewards costs related to new account acquisitions, particularly during the second half of 2015. Citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments was offset by modest growth in average loans. Retail banking revenues increased 6% from the prior 

6

year to $5.2 billion, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads. North America GCB average deposits of $172 billion increased 1% year-over-year and average retail loans of $50 billion grew 7%. Average card loans of $107 billion decreased 2%, while purchase sales of $263 billion increased 4% versus the prior year. For additional information on the results of operations of North America GCB for 2015, see “Global Consumer Banking— North America GCB” below. 

International GCB revenues (consisting of EMEA GCB, Latin America GCB and Asia GCB) decreased 12% versus the prior year to $14.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB revenues were unchanged versus the prior year. Latin America GCB revenues increased 3% versus the prior year, as increases in loan and deposit balances as well as the impact of business divestitures were partially offset by the continued impact of spread compression in cards. Asia GCB revenues declined 3% versus the prior year, reflecting lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in cards, partially offset by growth in lending, deposit and insurance products. For additional information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations of EMEA GCB for reporting purposes) for 2015, including the impact of FX translation, see “Global Consumer Banking” below. Year-over-year, international GCB average deposits of $129 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $99 billion increased 3%, investment sales of $78 billion decreased 8%, average card loans of $26 billion increased 2% and card purchase sales of $101 billion increased 6%, all excluding the impact of FX translation. 

ICG revenues were $33.7 billion in 2015, up 2% from the prior year. Excluding CVA/DVA, ICG revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year at $33.5 billion. 

Banking revenues of $16.9 billion, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of mark-to-market gains on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending (see below), were largely unchanged compared to the prior year, as lower equity underwriting activity within investment banking as well as the impact of FX translation was offset by higher advisory revenues and continued growth in the private bank. Investment banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 3% versus the prior year. Advisory revenues increased 16% to $1.1 billion with sustained wallet share gains for the year. Debt underwriting revenues increased 1% to $2.5 billion, driven by wallet share gains in investment grade debt and strong performance in investment grade loans in the second half of 2015, while equity underwriting revenues decreased 28% to $902 million, largely reflecting lower industry-wide underwriting activity during the year. 

Private bank revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 8% to $2.9 billion from the prior year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances as well as growth in managed investments revenue. Corporate lending revenues rose 8% to $2.0 billion, including $323 million of mark-to-market gains on hedges related to accrual loans compared to a $116 million gain in the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation and the mark-to-market impact of loan hedges, corporate 

lending revenues increased 3% versus the prior year, as growth in average loans was partially offset by the impact of lower spreads. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $7.8 billion were relatively unchanged versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 6%, as continued growth in deposit balances and spreads was partially offset by lower trade revenues. 

Markets and securities services revenues of $16.3 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, decreased 1% from the prior year. Fixed income markets revenues of $11.3 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, decreased 7% from the prior year, as growth in rates and currencies was more than offset by a slowdown in spread products, reflecting the volatile trading environment during the year. Equity markets revenues of $3.1 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 13% versus the prior year driven by growth across all products. Securities services revenues of $2.1 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, and increased 15% excluding the impact of FX translation, reflecting increased client activity and higher client balances. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for 2015, see “Institutional Clients Group” below.

Corporate/Other revenues increased to $907 million from $301 million in the prior year, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks during the course of 2015. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other in 2015, see “Corporate/Other” below.

Citicorp end-of-period loans increased 1% to $573 billion from the prior year, as a 5% increase in corporate loans was partially offset by a 2% decrease in consumer loans. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citicorp loans grew 5%, with 8% growth in corporate loans and 2% growth in consumer loans.

Citi Holdings

Citi Holdings’ net income was $1.0 billion in 2015, compared to a net loss of $3.5 billion in the prior year. CVA/DVA was negative $15 million (negative $10 million after-tax) in 2015, compared to negative $47 million (negative $29 million after-tax) in the prior year. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA in both periods and the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, Citi Holdings’ net income was $1.1 billion, compared to $275 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower expenses and lower credit costs.

Citi Holdings’ revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year at $7.8 billion. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings’ revenues decreased 1% to $7.9 billion from the prior year, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio and the impact of redemptions of high cost debt, mostly offset by the impact of higher gains on asset sales. For additional information on the results of operations of Citi Holdings in 2015, see “Citi Holdings” below.

At the end of 2015, Citi Holdings’ assets were $74 billion, 43% below the prior year, and represented approximately 4% of Citi’s total GAAP assets. Citi Holdings’ risk-weighted assets were $133 billion as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of 30% from the prior year, and represented 11% of Citi’s risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

CITICORP

Citicorp is Citigroup’s global bank for consumers and businesses and represents Citi’s core franchises. Citicorp is focused on providing best-in-class products and services to customers and leveraging Citigroup’s unparalleled global network, including many of the world’s emerging economies. Citicorp is physically present in approximately 100 countries, many for over 100 years, and offers services in over 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi believes this global network provides a strong foundation for servicing the broad financial services needs of its large multinational clients and for meeting the needs of retail, private banking, commercial, public sector and institutional clients around the world.

Citicorp consists of the following operating businesses: Global Consumer Banking (which consists of consumer banking businesses in North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia) and Institutional Clients Group (which includes Banking and Markets and securities services). Citicorp also includes Corporate/Other. At December 31, 2015, Citicorp had approximately $1.7 trillion of assets and $901 billion of deposits, representing approximately 96% of Citi’s total assets and 99% of Citi’s total deposits.

Consistent with its strategy to continue to efficiently allocate its resources and further simplify its Global Consumer Bank, in February 2016, Citi announced that it intends to exit its consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. These consumer businesses, consisting of approximately $6 billion of assets, $5 billion of consumer loans and $3 billion of deposits as of December 31, 2015, contributed approximately $1.1 billion of revenues, $900 million of expenses and a net loss of $34 million in 2015. These businesses, which previously have been reported as part of Latin America GCB, will be reported as part of Citi Holdings beginning in the first quarter of 2016. See also “Citigroup Segments” above and “Citi Holdings” below. While Citi does not intend to exit its consumer businesses in Venezuela, these businesses are not significant, lending predominantly to support ICG activities, and will be reported as part of ICG beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Similarly, Citi’s remaining indirect investment in Banco de Chile will be reported as part of ICG beginning in the first quarter of 2016.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING

Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consists of Citigroup’s four geographical consumer banking businesses that provide traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, including commercial banking, and Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above). GCB is a globally diversified business with 2,994 branches in 24 countries around the world as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, GCB had approximately $394 billion of assets and $301 billion of deposits.

 GCB’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and seek to be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies. Consistent with its strategy, since 2012, Citi has exited, or is in the process of exiting, 20 consumer markets and has reduced its branch footprint by 25% to focus its global presence.

NORTH AMERICA GCB

North America GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the U.S. North America GCB’s U.S. cards product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the Citi Double Cash, Thank You and Value cards) and co-branded cards (including, among others, American Airlines and Hilton Worldwide) within Citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label relationships within Citi retail services. 

As of December 31, 2015, North America GCB’s 780 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also as of December 31, 2015, North America GCB had approximately 10.9 million retail banking customer accounts, $51.8 billion of retail banking loans and $172.8 billion of deposits. In addition, North America GCB had approximately 113.4 million Citi-branded and Citi retail services credit card accounts, with $113.3 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income decreased by 4% due to lower loan loss reserve releases and lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower net credit losses.

Revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by higher revenues in retail banking. 

Retail banking revenues increased 6%. The increase was primarily driven by 7% growth in average loans, 9% growth in average checking deposits, improved deposit spreads and slightly higher mortgage origination revenues, partially offset by lower net gains on branch sales (approximately $40 million) and mortgage portfolio sales (approximately $80 million) as well as a lower mortgage repurchase reserve release (approximately $50 million) compared to 2014. This growth in retail banking revenues occurred despite the fact that, consistent with GCB’s strategy, during 2015, North America GCB closed or sold 69 branches (a 9% decline from the prior year), with announced plans to sell or close an additional 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016. With these actions, over 90% of North America GCB’s retail banking footprint will be concentrated in its six key metropolitan areas.

Cards revenues decreased 3% due to a 2% decline in average loans, partially offset by a 4% increase in purchase sales. In Citi-branded cards, revenues decreased 6%, primarily reflecting an increase in acquisition and rewards costs, particularly during the second half of 2015 as North America GCB deployed its investment spending (as discussed below) to grow its new account acquisitions in its core products. North America GCB expects the increased acquisition and rewards costs within Citi-branded cards to continue to negatively impact revenues in 2016. The decrease in Citi-branded cards revenues was also due to the continued impact of lower average loans (down 4%), driven primarily by continued high customer payment rates during the year, partially offset by a 6% increase in purchase sales. 

Citi retail services revenues were largely unchanged as the continued impact of lower fuel prices, which negatively impacts purchase sales in the fuel portfolios, and higher contractual partner payments was offset by the impact of higher spreads and volumes (1% increase in average loans). The higher contractual partner payments resulted from the business sharing the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with its retail partners. Purchase sales were unchanged as the continued impact of lower fuel prices was offset by volume growth. North America GCB expects the negative impact of lower fuel prices on Citi retail services revenues to continue in the near term. 

Expenses decreased 5%, primarily due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including as a result of the branch rationalization strategy, and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by increased investment spending (including marketing, among other areas) in Citi-branded cards, which is expected to continue into 2016. 

Provisions increased 15% largely due to lower net loan loss reserve releases (73%), partially offset by lower net credit losses (11%). Net credit losses declined in Citi-branded cards (down 14% to $1.9 billion) and in Citi retail services (down 8% to $1.7 billion). The lower loan loss reserve release 

reflected overall credit stabilization in the cards portfolios during 2015. As a result of this stabilization, North America GCB expects to experience modest loan loss reserve builds during 2016.

In addition to the trends discussed above expected to impact North America GCB’s results of operations in 2016, North America GCB expects to make additional investments in its U.S. cards businesses during 2016, including investments in connection with Citi’s planned acquisition of the Costco portfolio, the closing of which is currently expected to occur mid-2016, as well as the expected impact of renewing certain important partnership programs in a competitive environment (see also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” below). While North America GCB believes these investments are necessary for the growth of its U.S. cards businesses, they will reduce the pretax earnings of the businesses during 2016. 

2014 vs. 2013

Net income increased by 13% due to lower net credit losses, higher loan loss reserve releases and lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 1%, with lower revenues in retail banking, partially offset by higher revenues in Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services. Retail banking revenues of $4.9 billion decreased 9% due to lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposit portfolios, partially offset by continued volume-related growth (average loans increased 9% and average deposits increased 3%) and gains from branch sales. 

Cards revenues increased 2% as average loans increased 3% versus 2013. In Citi-branded cards, revenues increased 1% as a 4% increase in purchase sales and higher net interest spreads, driven by the continued reduction of promotional balances in the portfolio, mostly offset lower average loans. The decline in average loans was driven primarily by the reduction in promotional balances, and to a lesser extent, increased customer payment rates during the year. 

Citi retail services revenues increased 4%, primarily due to a 12% increase in average loans driven by the Best Buy acquisition in September 2013, partially offset by continued declines in fee revenues primarily reflecting higher yields and improving credit and the resulting increase in contractual partner payments. Citi retail services revenues also benefited from lower funding costs, partially offset by a decline in net interest spreads due to a higher percentage of promotional balances within the portfolio. 

Expenses decreased 1% as ongoing cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by higher repositioning charges, increased investment spending and an increase in Citi retail services expenses due to the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. 

Provisions decreased 18% due to lower net credit losses (9%) and higher loan loss reserve releases (21%). Net credit losses declined in Citi-branded cards (down 14% to $2.2 billion) and in Citi retail services (down 2% to $1.9 billion). The loan loss reserve release increased due to the continued improvement in Citi-branded cards, partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve release in Citi retail services due to reserve builds for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio.

LATIN AMERICA GCB

Latin America GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, with the largest presence in Mexico. As of December 31, 2015, Latin America GCB includes branch networks in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela as well as Banco Nacional de Mexico, or Banamex, Mexico’s second-largest bank. 

At December 31, 2015, Latin America GCB had 1,694 retail branches (1,492 through Banamex in Mexico), with approximately 31.9 million retail banking customer accounts, $24.0 billion in retail banking loans and $40.8 billion in deposits. In addition, the business had approximately 7.8 million Citi-branded card accounts with $7.5 billion in outstanding loan balances. As announced in February 2016, Citi intends to exit its consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. For additional information, see “Citigroup Segments” and “Citicorp” above.

For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income decreased 5% as higher expenses were partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the approximately $180 million gain on sale in the third quarter of 2015 related to the Mexico merchant acquiring business. Excluding this gain, revenues increased 1% as the impact of modest volume growth was mostly offset by the absence of gains and revenues from businesses divested in 2014, including as a result of the sale of the Honduras consumer business in the second quarter and the partial sale of Citi’s indirect investment in Banco de Chile in the first quarter, as well as continued spread compression in cards. Revenues were also impacted by continued slow economic growth in the region during 2015. 

Retail banking revenues increased 6%, excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business and the business divestitures in 2014. This increase in retail banking revenues reflected volume growth, including an increase in average loans (4%) and average deposits (5%), partially offset by a decline in investment sales (15%). Cards revenues decreased 2%, primarily due to higher payment rates in Mexico resulting from the business’ focus on higher credit quality customers, consistent with GCB’s strategy, as well as muted volumes (low purchase sales growth and unchanged average loans). Cards revenues were also negatively impacted by ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, including due to the previously-disclosed regulatory reforms enacted in 2013 in Mexico. Latin America GCB expects the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated in 2016.

Expenses increased 5%, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance costs, higher technology spending and mandatory salary increases in certain countries, partially offset by lower repositioning charges, lower legal and related costs and ongoing efficiency savings.

Provisions were unchanged as higher net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve build. Net credit losses increased 1%, largely reflecting portfolio growth as well as net credit losses incurred in the commercial banking portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015 associated with a wind-down portfolio in Brazil, most of which was offset by the release of previously-established loan loss reserves. The higher net credit losses were partially offset by the absence of a $71 million charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to Citi’s homebuilder exposure in Mexico. The net loan loss reserve build declined 13%, primarily due to lower builds related to Mexico cards, partially offset by higher builds related to Brazil in the second half of 2015, as well as the absence of the releases related to the Mexico homebuilder exposure in 2014. 

Argentina/Venezuela

For additional information on Citi’s exposures and risks in Argentina and Venezuela, see “Managing Global Risk—Country Risk” below.

2014 vs. 2013 

Net income increased 7% as higher revenues were partially offset by higher expenses and credit costs.

Revenues increased 4%, primarily due to volume growth and spread and fee growth in Mexico, partially offset by continued spread compression in the region and slower overall economic growth in certain Latin America markets, including Mexico and Brazil during 2014. Retail banking revenues increased 3% as average loans increased 6%, investment sales increased 25% and average deposits increased 6%, partially offset by lower spreads in Brazil and Colombia. Cards revenues increased 8% as average loans increased 5% and purchase sales increased 1%, excluding the impact of Credicard’s results in the prior-year period (for additional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in cards revenues was partially offset by lower economic growth and slowing cards purchase sales in Mexico due to the regulatory reforms enacted during 2013, as referenced above. 

Expenses increased 5%, primarily due to mandatory salary increases in certain countries, higher legal and related costs, increased repositioning charges and higher technology spending, partially offset by productivity and repositioning savings.

Provisions increased 5%, primarily due to higher net credit losses, which were partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve build. Net credit losses increased 22%, driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the Mexico cards portfolio. Net credit losses were also impacted by both the slower economic growth and regulatory reforms in Mexico as well as the $71 million charge-off related to Citi’s homebuilder exposure in Mexico.

ASIA GCB

Asia GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s most significant revenues in the region were from Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, India, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. In addition, for reporting purposes, Asia GCB includes the results of operations of EMEA GCB, which provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, and Citi-branded card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, primarily in Poland, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

At December 31, 2015, on a combined basis, the businesses had 520 retail branches, approximately 17.5 million retail banking customer accounts, $71.0 billion in retail banking loans and $87.8 billion in deposits. In addition, the business had approximately 16.9 million Citi-branded card accounts with $17.7 billion in outstanding loan balances.

Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income decreased 2%, primarily due to lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses.

Revenues decreased 3%, primarily due to an industry-wide slowdown in investment sales, particularly in the second half of 2015, as well as spread compression and higher payment rates and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in cards, partially offset by volume growth. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a decline in investment sales revenue, particularly in Taiwan, Singapore, India, Korea and Indonesia, reflecting weaker customer confidence due to slowing economic growth and volatility in the capital markets, as well as spread compression, particularly in Poland. This decline in revenues was partially offset by higher volumes, driven by lending (2% increase in average loans), deposit products (5% increase in average deposits) and higher insurance fee revenues. Citi expects investment sales revenues could continue to be challenged in 2016, depending upon overall consumer sentiment, economic growth and the capital markets environment in the region. 

Cards revenues decreased 5%, primarily due to spread compression, including continued high payment rates, and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia and Poland, partially offset by modest volume growth (a 3% increase in average loans and a 5% increase in purchase sales). Cards revenues were also impacted by the weaker customer confidence, primarily in the second half of 2015. Spread compression and regulatory changes will likely continue to have a negative impact on cards revenues in the near term.

Expenses decreased 4%, primarily due to the absence of repositioning charges in Korea in 2014 and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, 

investment spending, volume-related growth and compensation expense.

Provisions decreased 1%, primarily due to higher loan loss reserve releases, largely offset by an increase in net credit losses related to the consumer business in Russia due to a deterioration in the economic environment. Overall credit quality remained stable across the region during 2015.

21

2014 vs. 2013 

Net income decreased 8%, primarily due to higher expenses, partially offset by lower credit costs and higher revenues.

Revenues increased 2%, reflecting higher retail banking revenues, partially offset by lower cards revenues. Retail banking revenues increased 4%, due to higher insurance fee revenues and volume growth (average retail loans increased 8% and average retail deposits increased 2%), partially offset by the ongoing impact of regulatory changes and continued spread compression. 

Cards revenues decreased 1%, due to the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Korea, Indonesia and Singapore, spread compression and customer deleveraging, largely offset by a 2% increase in average loans and a 3% increase in purchase sales driven by growth in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong.

Expenses increased 7%, primarily due to higher repositioning charges in Korea, investment spending and volume-related growth, partially offset by higher efficiency savings.

Provisions decreased 9%, primarily due to higher overall loan loss reserve releases, partially offset by a loan loss reserve build related to the consumer business in Russia.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees and Investment banking. In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on inventory and loans held less interest paid to customers on deposits is recorded as Net interest revenue. Revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. 

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in over 95 countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2015, ICG had approximately $1.2 trillion of assets and $587 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses, securities services and issuer services, managed approximately $15.1 trillion of assets under custody compared to $16.1 trillion at the end of 2014. The decline in assets under custody from 2014 was primarily due to the impact of FX translation and a decline in market volumes.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes the impact of CVA/DVA for all periods presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2015 vs. 2014

Net income decreased 4%, primarily driven by higher credit costs, partially offset by lower expenses. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Within Banking:

•Investment banking revenues decreased 3%, largely reflecting an industry-wide activity decline in underwriting activity. Advisory revenues increased 16%, reflecting increased target client activity and strength in the overall M&A market. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 28% driven by the lower market activity and a decline in wallet share resulting from continued share fragmentation. Debt underwriting revenues increased 1%, driven by increased wallet share in investment grade debt and strong performance in investment grade loans in the second half of 2015, partially offset by the lower market activity and decreased wallet share in high-yield and leveraged loans.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Corporate lending revenues increased 8%. Excluding the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues decreased 3%. Excluding the impact of FX translation and gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues increased 3% as continued growth in average loan balances, lower hedge premium costs and an improvement in mark-to-market adjustments were partially offset by lower spreads, particularly in EMEA. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Within Markets and securities services: 

•Fixed income markets revenues decreased 7%, driven by North America, primarily due to a volatile trading environment during 2015 due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The decrease in fixed income markets revenues resulted from a decline in spread products revenues (credit markets, securitized markets and municipals), partially offset by strength in rates and currencies. Rates and currencies revenues increased 4% due to higher revenues in local markets and overall G10 products, partially offset by G10 foreign exchange. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Securities services revenues increased 4%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 15%, reflecting increased client activity and higher client balances.

Expenses decreased 2% as efficiency savings, the impact of FX translation and lower repositioning charges were partially offset by increased regulatory and compliance costs and compensation expense. 

 Provisions increased $872 million to $929 million, primarily reflecting a net loan loss reserve build ($722 million), compared to a net loan loss reserve release ($219 million) in 2014. The net loan loss reserve build included approximately $530 million for energy and energy-related exposures, including $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to the significant decline in commodity prices during the second half of 2015. (For additional information on Citi’s energy and energy-related exposures, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Corporate Credit” below.) The remainder of the build during 2015 was primarily due to volume growth and overall macroeconomic conditions. 

The higher net loan loss reserve build during 2015 was partially offset by lower net credit losses. Net credit losses decreased 25%, primarily due to the absence of net credit losses of approximately $165 million related to the Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) supplier program, which were incurred during 2014 (for additional information, see Citi’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2014), partially offset by increased net credit losses related to a limited number of energy and energy-related exposures, including approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Looking to 2016, cost of credit in ICG will largely depend on the price of oil and other commodity prices as well as macroeconomic conditions. To the extent commodity prices remain at year-end 2015 levels, or deteriorate further, ICG expects to incur additional loan loss reserve builds in its energy and energy-related portfolios, which could be significant, and Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans could be negatively impacted. Such events as well as macroeconomic conditions could also negatively impact Citi’s other corporate credit portfolios.

25

2014 vs. 2013

Net income increased 1%, primarily driven by lower expenses, largely offset by lower revenues. Excluding the impact of the net fraud loss of $360 million in Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2013, net income decreased 1%, primarily driven by the lower revenues and higher expenses, largely offset by lower credit costs.

•Revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in Markets and securities services (decrease of 8%), partially offset by higher revenues in Banking (increase of 7%, or 5% excluding the gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans). 

Within Banking:

•Investment banking revenues increased 7%, reflecting a stronger overall market environment and improved wallet share with ICG’s target clients, partially offset by a modest decline in overall wallet share. The decline in overall wallet share was primarily driven by equity and debt underwriting and reflected market fragmentation. Advisory revenues increased 12%, reflecting the increased target client activity and an expansion of the overall M&A market. Equity underwriting revenues increased 18% largely in line with overall growth in market fees. Debt underwriting revenues were largely unchanged.

•Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 1%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 3% as continued higher deposit balances, fee growth and trade activity were partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally. End-of-period deposit balances were unchanged, but increased 3% excluding the impact of FX translation, largely driven by North America. Average trade loans decreased 9% (7% excluding the impact of FX translation).

•Corporate lending revenues increased 52%. Excluding the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues increased 15%, primarily due to continued growth in average loan balances and lower funding costs. 

•Private bank revenues increased 7% due to growth in client business volumes and improved spreads in banking, higher capital markets activity and an increase in assets under management in managed investments, partially offset by continued spread compression in lending.

Within Markets and securities services:

•Fixed income markets revenues decreased 11%, driven by a decrease in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues. Rates and currencies revenues declined due to historically muted levels of volatility, uncertainties around Russia and Greece and lower client activity in the first half of 2014. In addition, the first half of 2013 included a strong performance in rates and currencies, driven in part by the impact of quantitative easing globally. Municipals and credit markets revenues declined due to challenging trading conditions resulting from macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2014. These declines were partially offset by increased 

securitized products and commodities revenues, largely in North America.

•Equity markets revenues decreased 1%, primarily reflecting weakness in EMEA, particularly cash equities, driven by volatility in Europe, largely offset by improved performance in prime finance due to increased customer flows.

•Securities services revenues increased 4%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues increased 5% due to increased volumes, assets under custody and overall client activity.

Expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings, the absence of the net fraud loss and lower performance-based compensation were partially offset by higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs. Excluding the impact of the net fraud loss, expenses increased 1%, as higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings and lower performance-based compensation.

 Provisions decreased 27%, primarily reflecting a release for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, compared to a build in 2013, partially offset by higher net credit losses and a lower loan loss reserve release driven by the overall economic environment. Net credit losses increased 52%, largely related to the Pemex supplier program during 2014 as well as write-offs related to a specific counterparty.

CORPORATE/OTHER

Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, Corporate Treasury and discontinued operations. At December 31, 2015, Corporate/Other had $52 billion of assets, or 3% of Citigroup’s total assets. For additional information, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM Not meaningful

2015 vs. 2014 

Net income was $423 million, compared to a net loss of $5.4 billion in 2014, largely reflecting significantly lower expenses, an increased tax benefit due to legal entity restructurings and resolution of certain state and local audits in the second quarter of 2015, as well as higher revenues.

Revenues increased $606 million to $907 million, primarily due to gains on debt buybacks during the course of 2015 and real estate sales in the second quarter of 2015 as well as higher revenues from sales of AFS securities, partially offset by hedging activities.

Expenses decreased $4.3 billion to $1.8 billion, largely driven by lower legal and related expenses ($796 million compared to $4.4 billion in 2014), a benefit from FX translation and lower repositioning charges.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, a change was enacted to the dividend rate Citi is entitled to receive on the shares of capital stock it is required to hold in the Federal Reserve System. Pursuant to current requirements, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is required to purchase stock equal to 3% of its capital stock and surplus (with an additional 3% subject to call by the Federal Reserve Board). As a result of the recent change, effective January 1, 2016, the statutory dividend Citi is to receive on these shares will decrease from a fixed 6% to the lesser of (i) the high-yield rate paid on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note based on the auction immediately preceding the dividend payment, and (ii) 6%. While the actual impact to Corporate/Other revenues (where Citi records this dividend) will be based on the number of shares of Federal Reserve System capital stock it holds at any given time as well as the quarter-to-quarter operational activities impacting the result of operations of Corporate/Other, based on year-end amounts, Citi estimates this change could negatively impact revenues in 

Corporate/Other by approximately $160 million annually going forward.

2014 vs. 2013 

The net loss increased $5.1 billion to $5.4 billion, primarily due to higher legal and related expenses.

Revenues decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower revenues from sales of AFS securities as well as hedging activities.

Expenses increased $5.0 billion to $6.0 billion, largely driven by the higher legal and related expenses ($4.4 billion compared to $172 million in 2013) as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs and higher repositioning charges.

CITI HOLDINGS

Citi Holdings contains the remaining businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses. Consistent with this determination, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, Citi’s consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia will be reported as part of Citi Holdings (for additional information, see “Citigroup Segments” and “Citicorp” above).

As of December 31, 2015, Citi Holdings assets were approximately $74 billion, a decrease of 43% year-over-year and 33% from September 30, 2015. The decline in assets of $36 billion from September 30, 2015 primarily consisted of divestitures and run-off, including, among others, completion of the sales of Citi’s retail banking and credit cards businesses in Japan and OneMain Financial. As of December 31, 2015, Citi had signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 

Also as of December 31, 2015, consumer assets in Citi Holdings were approximately $64 billion, or approximately 86% of Citi Holdings assets. Of the consumer assets, approximately $38 billion, or 59%, consisted of North America mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans). As of December 31, 2015, Citi Holdings represented approximately 4% of Citi’s GAAP assets and 11% of its risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

The discussion of the results of operations for Citi Holdings below excludes the impact of CVA/DVA for all periods presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes the presentation of Citi Holdings’ results excluding the impact of CVA/DVA is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2015 vs. 2014 

Net income was $1.1 billion, an improvement from a net loss of $3.5 billion in 2014, largely due to the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014 (see “Executive Summary” above). Excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased $782 million, primarily due to lower expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. While Citi Holdings expects to have positive net income during 2016, given the significant asset sales and declines in overall Citi Holdings’ assets during 2015, it does not expect to generate the same level of net income in 2016 as in 2015.

Revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio, the impact of redemptions of high cost debt and the impact of recording OneMain Financial net credit losses as a reduction of revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2015, mostly offset by higher gains on asset sales, including in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the sales of OneMain Financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in Japan.

Expenses declined 52%. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 22%, primarily due to the ongoing decline in assets and lower legal and related costs ($420 million compared to $986 million in 2014). 

Provisions decreased 26%. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions decreased 24%, driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loss reserve release. Net credit losses declined 42%, primarily due to the impact of the recording of OneMain Financial net credit losses as a reduction in revenue, continued improvements in North America mortgages and overall lower asset levels. The net reserve release decreased 42%. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 46% to $529 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the North America mortgage portfolio as the portfolio has been reduced and credit has improved. 

2014 vs. 2013 

The net loss increased by $1.6 billion to $3.5 billion, largely due to the impact of the mortgage settlement, partially offset by higher revenues and lower cost of credit. Excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased by $2.2 billion to $275 million, primarily due to lower expenses, lower net credit losses and higher revenues, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.

Revenues increased 17%, primarily driven by gains on asset sales, including the sales of the consumer operations in Greece and Spain in the third quarter of 2014, lower funding costs and the absence of residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims as compared to 2013, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt associated with funding Citi Holdings assets.

Expenses increased 22%. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 25%, primarily driven 

by lower legal and related costs ($986 million compared to $2.6 billion in 2013) as well as the ongoing decline in assets.

Provisions decreased 16%. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions declined 19%, driven by a 44% decline in net credit losses primarily due to continued improvements in North America mortgages and overall lower 

asset levels. The net reserve release decreased 55%. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 53%, primarily due to lower net releases related to the North America mortgage portfolio, partially offset by lower losses on asset sales. 

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)

The selling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has been the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. regulators and, more recently, the U.K. Supreme Court. For additional information on PPI, see “Citi Holdings” in Citi’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 filed with the SEC on March 3, 2014. 

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI being unsuitable for the customer. Redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest together with compensatory interest of 8%. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.K. Supreme Court issued a ruling in a case (Plevin) involving PPI pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the PPI contract, the PPI contract at issue in the case was “unfair” due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the FCA issued a consultation paper that proposed (1) a deadline for PPI complaints (both non-Plevin and Plevin complaints) of two years after the effective date of the final rules; (2) an FCA-led customer communications campaign in advance of the deadline, with bank funding of the campaign; and (3) a failure to disclose a sales commission of 50% or more would be deemed unfair when assessing a new PPI complaint and require a customer refund of the difference between the commission paid and 50%, plus interest. Final rules are expected from the FCA in spring 2016.

During 2015, Citi increased its PPI reserves by approximately $153 million ($65 million of which was recorded in Citi Holdings and $88 million of which was recorded in discontinued operations), including a $106 million reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($39 million of which was recorded in Citi Holdings and $67 million of which was recorded in discontinued operations). The increase for full year 2015 compared to an increase of $118 million during 2014. While the overall level of claims generally remained 

29

unchanged in 2015, the increase in the reserves during 2015, including in the fourth quarter of 2015, was due in part to the Plevin case and the guidelines set forth in the FCA’s consultation paper, including the proposed customer communications campaign. 

Citi’s year-end 2015 PPI reserve was $262 million (compared to $225 million as of December 31, 2014).

Additional reserving actions, if any, in 2016 will largely depend on the timing of and response to the FCA’s final rules, including the level of customer response to any communications campaign.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:

•purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;

•holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities; 

•providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and

•entering into operating leases for property and equipment.

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements also assist Citi and Citi’s customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.

The table below shows where a discussion of Citi’s various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Notes 1, 22 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table includes information on Citigroup’s contractual obligations, as specified and aggregated pursuant to SEC requirements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)For additional information about long-term debt obligations, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)Contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2016–2020 are calculated by applying the December 31, 2015 weighted-average interest rate (3.32%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. The “Thereafter” interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2021–2098) are calculated by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.

(3)Purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable.

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview

Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s businesses and to absorb credit, market, and operational losses. Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, among other issuances. During 2015, Citi continued to raise capital through noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances amounting to approximately $6.3 billion, resulting in a total of approximately $16.7 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In addition, during 2015, Citi returned a total of approximately $5.9 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases (approximately 101 million common shares) and dividends.

Further, Citi’s capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting and regulatory standards as well as the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions. 

Capital Management

Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, management targets, and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed economic environments. Underlying these internal quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, centered on preserving and building financial strength. The Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, including the capital assessment and planning process, which is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and Liability Committee. For additional information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing exercises, see “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards

Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board which, commencing with 2014, constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory capital (including the application of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which are primarily models based, include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets. Conversely, the Standardized Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets and generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are derived on a generally consistent basis under both approaches. 

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these rules provide for both a fixed Capital Conservation Buffer and a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer, which would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at the current level of 0%, and issued a proposed framework for implementing the Countercyclical Capital Buffer in the future. For additional information regarding the Federal Reserve Board’s proposed policy statement on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, see “Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” below.

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches 

banking organizations, such as Citi and Citibank, to calculate each of the three risk-based capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital) under both the Standardized Approach starting on January 1, 2015 (or, for 2014, prior to the effective date of the Standardized Approach, the Basel I credit risk and Basel II.5 market risk capital rules) and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report (as well as measure compliance against) the lower of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.

33

GSIB Surcharge

In August 2015, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule which imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, and would result in restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary executive bonuses) should the expanded buffer be breached to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, with the degree of such restrictions based upon the extent to which the expanded buffer is breached.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule, identification of a GSIB would be based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other categories are comprised of multiple indicators also of equal weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total. 

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB under the established methodology will be required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and will be subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad categories of systemic importance used to identify a GSIB. Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Moreover, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. Generally, the surcharge derived under method 2 will result in a higher surcharge than derived under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2016 would not become effective until January 1, 2018). However, if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 31, 2016 would become effective January 1, 2017).

GSIB surcharges under the final rule, which are required to be composed entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, initially range from 1.0% to 4.5% of total risk-weighted assets. Citi’s initial GSIB surcharge effective January 1, 2016, which is based primarily on 2014 quantitative measures of systemic importance (other than the short-term wholesale funding measure under method 2, based on 2015 data), is 3.5%. However, Citi’s ongoing efforts during 2015 in managing balance sheet efficiency has resulted in lower scores for substantially all of the quantitative measures of systemic importance, and consequently has reduced Citi’s estimated GSIB surcharge to 3%, also derived under method 2, which would become effective January 1, 2017. 

Transition Provisions

The U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-outs”) with respect to the stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratio requirements, substantially all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, and non-qualifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities and certain subordinated debt issuances). Moreover, the GSIB surcharge will be introduced in parallel with the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if applicable, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer, commencing phase-in on January 1, 2016 and becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. With the exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities which do not fully phase-out until January 1, 2022 and the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge which do not fully phase-in until January 1, 2019, all other transition provisions will be entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios by January 1, 2018. Citi considers all of these transition provisions as being fully implemented on January 1, 2019 (full implementation), with the inclusion of the capital buffers and GSIB surcharge. 

The following chart sets forth the transitional progression to full implementation by January 1, 2019 of the regulatory capital components (i.e., inclusive of the mandatory 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as well as an estimated 3% GSIB surcharge) comprising the effective minimum risk-based capital ratios.

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios

The following chart presents the transition arrangements (phase-in and phase-out) under the U.S. Basel III rules for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions relative to Citi. 

Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions for all intangible assets other than goodwill and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); and excess over 10%/15% limitations for deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs. Goodwill (including goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions) is fully deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital commencing January 1, 2014. The amount of other intangible assets, aside from MSRs, not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 100%, as are the excess over the 10%/15% limitations for DTAs arising from temporary differences, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs prior to full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules. Upon full implementation, the amount of temporary difference DTAs, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs not deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 250%. 

(2)Includes the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital deductions related to DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards and defined benefit pension plan net assets; and the phase-in of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital adjustment for cumulative unrealized net gains (losses) related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to Citi’s own creditworthiness.

(3)To the extent Additional Tier 1 Capital is not sufficient to absorb regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, such excess is to be applied against Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 

(4)Includes the phase-out from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of adjustments related to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities; unrealized gains on AFS equity securities; unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI); and defined benefit plans liability adjustment. 

35

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi, as with principally all U.S. banking organizations, is also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Advanced Approaches banking organizations are additionally required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches banking organizations will be required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3% commencing on January 1, 2018, but commenced publicly disclosing this ratio on January 1, 2015. 

Further, U.S. GSIBs, and their subsidiary insured depository institutions, including Citi and Citibank, are subject to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 2% leverage buffer for U.S. GSIBs in addition to the stated 3% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement in the U.S. Basel III rules. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 2% leverage buffer, it will be subject to increasingly onerous restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. Accordingly, U.S. GSIBs are effectively subject to a 5% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement. Additionally, insured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, are required to maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6% to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi and Citibank are required to be compliant with these higher effective minimum ratio requirements on January 1, 2018.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework

The U.S. Basel III rules revised the PCA regulations applicable to insured depository institutions in certain respects. 

In general, the PCA regulations direct the U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized”; (ii) “adequately capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized”; 

(iv) “significantly undercapitalized”; and (v) “critically undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2015, an insured depository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8%, 10% and 5%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, Advanced Approaches insured depository institutions, such as Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6%, effective January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Capital Planning and Stress Testing

Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether Citi has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: 

•The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process, and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to Citi’s annual capital plan based on either quantitative or qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates in writing that it does not object to the distribution. 

•Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Federal Reserve Board, the financial companies, and the general public, how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same three supervisory scenarios as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under company-developed scenarios.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, certain pro forma regulatory capital ratios (i.e., Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios), and any other additional capital measures deemed 

36

relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under baseline conditions and under a range of stressed scenarios. All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework only and the transition arrangements under the U.S. Basel III rules. 

In November 2015, the Federal Reserve Board released a final rule, which for purposes of CCAR, adopted targeted amendments to its capital plan and stress test rules. Effective January 1, 2016, the final rule removed all requirements related to the Tier 1 Common Capital ratio (originally defined in conjunction with the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program), as it has effectively been replaced by the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio requirement subsequent to the implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules. Moreover, the final rule delayed the use of the Supplementary Leverage ratio until the 2017 capital planning cycle, and deferred the use of the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely. For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk 

Factors—Regulatory Risks” below. 

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory Standards 

During 2015 and thereafter, Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The stated minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratio requirements in 2014 were 4% and 5.5%, respectively, while the stated minimum Total Capital ratio requirement of 8% remained unchanged. 

 Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding

company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels. 

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements) for Citi as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

(3)In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on HTM securities. This amount relates to securities that were previously transferred from AFS to HTM, and non-credit related factors such as changes in interest rates and liquidity spreads for HTM securities with other-than-temporary impairment. 

(4)The transition arrangements for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions impacting Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and/or Additional Tier 1 Capital are set forth above in the chart entitled “Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions.”

(5)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(6)The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules. 

(7)Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

(8)Of Citi’s approximately $47.8 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2015, approximately $22.9 billion of such assets were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while approximately $24.9 billion of such assets were excluded in arriving at regulatory capital. Comprising the excluded net DTAs was an aggregate of approximately $26.3 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences, of which $12.1 billion were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and $14.2 billion were deducted from Additional Tier 1 Capital. In addition, approximately $1.4 billion of net DTLs, primarily consisting of DTLs associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets, partially offset by DTAs related to cash flow hedges, are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net DTAs subject to deduction under these rules. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, while Citi’s current cash flow hedges and the related deferred tax effects are not required to be reflected in regulatory capital. 

(9)Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. 

(10)Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, as well as non-grandfathered trust preferred securities which are eligible for inclusion in an amount up to 25% and 50%, respectively, during 2015 and 2014, of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014. The remaining 75% and 50% of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital during 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accordance with the transition arrangements for non-qualifying capital instruments under the U.S. Basel III rules. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, however, the entire amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities was included within Tier 1 Capital, as the amounts outstanding did not exceed the respective threshold for exclusion from Tier 1 Capital.

(11)50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(12)Effective July 2015, banking entities are required to be in compliance with the so-called “Volcker Rule” of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the “Volcker Rule” to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013. 

(13)Under the transition arrangements of the U.S. Basel III rules, non-qualifying subordinated debt issuances which consist of those with a fixed-to-floating rate step-up feature where the call/step-up date has not passed are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital during 2015 and 2014 up to 25% and 50%, respectively, of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014. 

(14)Advanced Approaches banking organizations are permitted to include in Tier 2 Capital eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. 

(15)Under the U.S. Basel III rules, credit risk-weighted assets during the transition period reflect the effects of transitional arrangements related to regulatory capital adjustments and deductions and, as a result, will differ from credit risk-weighted assets derived under full implementation of the rules.

(2)Retail exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to reductions in loans, divestitures within the Citi Holdings portfolio, and the impact of FX translation. Retail exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to reductions in loans and commitments, divestitures within the Citi Holdings portfolio and the impact of FX translation, partially offset by the reclassification from other exposures of certain non-material portfolios.

(3)Wholesale exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in commitments, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. Wholesale exposures increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in investments and commitments and the reclassification from other exposures of certain non-material portfolios, largely offset by the impact of FX translation.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(5)Derivatives CVA decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by exposure reduction and parameter and model updates. Derivatives CVA decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 driven by exposure reduction, credit spread changes and model updates.

(6)Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. Other exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreased cleared transaction exposures, reduction of retail non-material exposures and decreases in other assets. Other exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the reclassification to retail exposures and wholesale exposures of certain non-material portfolios, reduction in retail non-material exposures, and decreases in other assets.

(7)Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA. 

(8)Risk levels decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a reduction in positions subject to securitization charges, the ongoing assessment regarding the applicability of the market risk capital rules to certain securitization positions, and a decrease in assets subject to standard specific risk charges. In addition, further contributing to the decline in risk levels during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were reductions in exposure levels subject to comprehensive risk, Value at Risk, and Stressed Value at Risk.

(9)Risk-weighted assets declined during the three months ended December 31, 2015 due to model volatility inputs. Risk-weighted assets declined during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 due to the implementation of the “Volcker Rule.” 

(10)Operational risk-weighted assets increased by $12.5 billion during the first quarter of 2015, reflecting an evaluation of ongoing events in the banking industry as well as continued enhancements to Citi’s operational risk model.

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2015 were in excess of the stated minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2015 under the revised PCA regulations which became effective January 1, 2015. 

Further, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This 

program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank’s capital planning process.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios Under Current Regulatory Capital Standards 

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), under current regulatory capital standards (reflecting Basel III Transition Arrangements), as of December 31, 2015. This 

information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets, or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2015, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of approximately $7.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by approximately $6.1 billion. 

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $17.4 billion at December 31, 2015, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer 

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain 

specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with 

their capital requirements at December 31, 2015.

Basel III (Full Implementation)

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Basel III 

(Full Implementation)

Citi currently estimates that its effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules, on a fully implemented basis and assuming a 3% GSIB surcharge, may be 10%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively. 

Further, under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must also comply with a 4% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio requirement and an effective 5% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, risk-based capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for Citi as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 

Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.07% at December 31, 2015, compared to 11.67% at September 30, 2015 and 10.57% at December 31, 2014 (all based on application of the Advanced Approaches for determining total risk-weighted assets). The quarter-over-quarter increase in the ratio was largely attributable to quarterly net income of $3.3 billion and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in AOCI as well as a $1.8 billion return of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. The increase in Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio from year-end 2014 reflected continued growth in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital resulting from net income of $17.2 billion and the favorable effects attributable to DTA utilization of approximately $1.5 billion, offset in part by the return of $5.9 billion of capital to common shareholders and movements in AOCI.

(3)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(4)The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and own-credit valuation adjustments on derivatives are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules. 

(5)Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

(6)Of Citi’s approximately $47.8 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2015, approximately $16.8 billion of such assets were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while approximately $31.0 billion of such assets were excluded in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Comprising the excluded net DTAs was an aggregate of approximately $32.4 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards as well as temporary differences that were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. In addition, approximately $1.4 billion of net DTLs, primarily consisting of DTLs associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets, partially offset by DTAs related to cash flow hedges, are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net DTAs subject to deduction under these rules. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, while Citi’s current cash flow hedges and the related deferred tax effects are not required to be reflected in regulatory capital.

(7)Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At December 31, 2015, the deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation, while at December 31, 2014, the deduction related to all three assets which exceeded both the 10% and 15% limitations. 

(8)Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 

(9)50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

(10)Effective July 2015, banking entities are required to be in compliance with the “Volcker Rule” of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the “Volcker Rule” to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013. 

(11)Non-qualifying subordinated debt issuances which consist of those with a fixed-to-floating rate step-up feature where the call/step-up date has not passed are excluded from Tier 2 Capital. 

(12)Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased-out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022. 

(13)Advanced Approaches banking organizations are permitted to include in Tier 2 Capital eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets.

(1)Restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-01 for LIHTC investments, consistent with current period presentation. 

Total risk-weighted assets under both the Basel III Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach declined from year-end 2014 primarily due to a decrease in credit risk-weighted assets resulting from the impact of FX translation and the ongoing decline in Citi Holdings assets, as well as a decline in market risk-weighted assets. In addition, partially offsetting the decrease in total risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches was an increase in operational risk-weighted assets reflecting an evaluation of ongoing events in the banking industry, as well as continued enhancements to Citi’s operational risk model.

(2)Retail exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to reductions in loans, divestitures within the Citi Holdings portfolio, and the impact of FX translation. Retail exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to reductions in loans and commitments, divestitures within the Citi Holdings portfolio and the impact of FX translation, partially offset by the reclassification from other exposures of certain non-material portfolios.

(3)Wholesale exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in commitments, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. Wholesale exposures increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in investments and commitments and the reclassification from other exposures of certain non-material portfolios, largely offset by the impact of FX translation.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(5)Derivatives CVA decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by exposure reduction and parameter and model updates. Derivatives CVA decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 driven by exposure reduction, credit spread changes and model updates. 

(6)Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. Other exposures decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreased cleared transaction exposures, reduction of retail non-material exposures and decreases in other assets. Other exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the reclassification to retail exposures and wholesale exposures of certain non-material portfolios, reduction in retail non-material exposures, and decreases in other assets.

(7)Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA. 

(8)Risk levels decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a reduction in positions subject to securitization charges, the ongoing assessment regarding the applicability of the market risk capital rules to certain securitization positions, and a decrease in assets subject to standard specific risk charges. In addition, further contributing to the decline in risk levels during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were reductions in exposure levels subject to comprehensive risk, Value at Risk, and Stressed Value at Risk.

(9)Risk-weighted assets declined during the three months ended December 31, 2015 due to model volatility inputs. Risk-weighted assets declined during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 due to the implementation of the “Volcker Rule.” 

(10)Operational risk-weighted assets increased by $12.5 billion during the first quarter of 2015, reflecting an evaluation of ongoing events in the banking industry as well as continued enhancements to Citi’s operational risk model.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.08% for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 6.85% for the third quarter of 2015 and 5.94% for the fourth quarter of 2014. The growth in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was principally driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital attributable largely to net income of $3.3 billion and a $1.5 billion noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issuance, as well as an overall reduction in Total Leverage Exposure resulting from reduced on-balance sheet assets and derivative exposures, partially offset by a $1.8 billion return of capital to common shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. The growth in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2014 was also principally driven by an 

increase in Tier 1 Capital attributable largely to net income of $17.2 billion and approximately $6.2 billion (net of issuance costs) of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances, offset in part by the return of capital to common shareholders. Further, a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure also contributed to the growth in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2014.

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

(5)Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions. 

Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio, assuming full implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, was 6.65% for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 6.67% for the third quarter of 2015 and 6.20% for the fourth quarter of 2014. The ratio remained substantially unchanged from the third quarter of 2015 as the growth in Tier 1 Capital resulting primarily from quarterly net income and a $2.1 billion noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issuance was offset by cash dividends paid by Citibank to its parent, Citicorp, and which were subsequently remitted to Citigroup. The increase in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2014 was principally driven by net income and DTA utilization, as well as an overall reduction in Total Leverage Exposure, partially offset by cash dividends paid by Citibank to its parent, Citicorp, and which were subsequently remitted to Citigroup.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments

Countercyclical Capital Buffer

In December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board released a proposed policy statement on the framework that would be followed in setting the amount of the U.S. Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Advanced Approaches banking organizations. In accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules, the amount of the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer is equal to the weighted average of Countercyclical Capital Buffer amounts established by the Federal Reserve Board for the national jurisdictions where the Advanced Approaches banking organization has private sector credit exposures. As a result, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer may differ for each Advanced Approaches banking organization. 

The Federal Reserve Board’s proposed framework for setting the U.S. Countercyclical Capital Buffer encompasses a number of financial-system vulnerabilities, as well as a wide range of financial and macroeconomic quantitative indicators. However, given that no single indicator or fixed set of indicators can adequately capture all the key vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy and financial system, the types of indicators and models considered in assessments of the appropriate level of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer are likely to change over time. 

The Federal Reserve Board expects to consider the applicable level of the U.S. Countercyclical Capital Buffer at least once per year. An increase in the amount of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer for U.S.-based credit exposures would generally have an effective date 12 months after such determination, while a decrease in the amount of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer would generally become effective the day after such determination. 

Revisions to the Standardized Approach for Credit Risk 

In December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued a second consultative document which proposes various revisions to the Standardized Approach in deriving credit risk-weighted assets. As proposed, the revised Standardized Approach seeks to balance risk sensitivity and complexity, and to promote comparability of credit risk-weighted assets across banking organizations and jurisdictions. 

The proposal would, in part, revise the Standardized Approach in measuring credit risk-weighted assets with respect to certain on-balance sheet assets, such as in relation to the risk-weighting methodologies employed with respect to bank, corporate, and real estate (both residential and commercial) exposures; the treatment of off-balance sheet commitments; and aspects of the credit risk mitigation framework. Moreover, the proposal would permit the use of external credit ratings combined with due diligence requirements in the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks and corporates, while also providing alternative approaches for jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external credit ratings for risk-based capital purposes, such as the U.S. Prior to finalizing the 

proposal, the Basel Committee will be conducting a comprehensive quantitative impact study so as to assist with assessing the risk-weighting calibration for each of the affected exposure classes, as well as will evaluate the appropriate implementation and transitional arrangements. The U.S. banking agencies have indicated that any changes to the U.S. Basel III rules as a result of the Basel Committee’s proposed revisions to the Standardized Approach would apply primarily to large, internationally active banking organizations. 

Revised Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk 

In January 2016, the Basel Committee issued a final rule which sets forth a revised market risk capital framework, resulting from the so-called “fundamental review of the trading book” and four quantitative impact studies over several years. 

The final rule establishes a revised boundary between the trading book and banking book which, in part, provides more prescriptive guidance as to qualifying trading book positions as well as imposes heightened restrictions and, in certain instances, additional capital charges, on the transfer of positions between the trading book and banking book. Moreover, the final rule also revises both the internal models approach and the standardized approach in certain respects. With regard to the internal models approach, the final rule introduces a more comprehensive model to measure market risk, provides for a more granular model approval process, and reduces the regulatory capital benefits of hedging activities and portfolio diversification. The final rule revises the standardized approach, in part, by calibrating it more closely to the internal models approach by increasing reliance on risk sensitivity inputs in the calculation of market risk capital requirements. The deadline for national jurisdictions to implement the revised market risk capital framework is January 1, 2019, with the effective date for banking organizations to begin reporting under the revised framework, subject to any required supervisory approvals, being December 31, 2019. 

If the U.S. banking agencies were to adopt the Basel Committee’s final rule unchanged, Citi believes its market risk-weighted assets could increase significantly. However, as set forth in the tables above, as of December 31, 2015, Citi’s market risk-weighted assets constituted approximately 6% of its total risk-weighted assets. Accordingly, Citi currently believes that the overall impact to its total risk-weighted assets and thus its risk-based capital ratios would not be material. Nevertheless, the ultimate impact to Citi’s market risk-weighted assets and potentially its risk-based capital ratios is uncertain and is subject to several factors including, but not limited to, the U.S. banking agencies’ implementation of a final rule, potential changes in the scale and scope of future market risk model approvals as well as potential risk mitigation actions. 

52

Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Book Value Per Share

Tangible common equity (TCE), as currently defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a different manner. TCE and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these capital metrics provide useful information, as they are used by investors and industry analysts.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion sets forth what management currently believes could be the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to Citi or its management, could also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties Citi may face.

REGULATORY RISKS

Citi’s Inability to Enhance Its 2015 Resolution Plan Submission Could Subject It to More Stringent Capital, Leverage or Liquidity Requirements, or Restrictions on Its Growth, Activities or Operations, and Could Eventually Require Citi to Divest Assets or Operations.

Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to annually prepare and submit a plan to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC for the orderly resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding company), and its significant legal entities, under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other applicable insolvency law in the event of future material financial distress or failure (Title I Resolution Plan). The Title I Resolution Plan requires significant effort, time and cost across all of Citi’s businesses and geographies, and is subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. 

Under Title I, if the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly determine that Citi’s 2015 Title I Resolution Plan is not “credible” (which, although not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow the regulators to resolve Citi in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption), or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of Citi under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and Citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified deficiencies, Citi could be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on its growth, activities or operations. If within two years from the imposition of any requirements or restrictions Citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies, then Citi could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. Any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact Citi’s reputation, market and investor perception, operations and strategy.

In August 2014, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC announced the completion of reviews of the 2013 Title I Resolution Plans submitted by Citi and 10 other financial institutions. The agencies identified shortcomings with the firms’ 2013 Title I Resolution Plans, including Citi’s. These shortcomings generally included (i) assumptions that the agencies regarded as unrealistic or inadequately supported, such as assumptions about the likely behavior of customers, counterparties, investors, central clearing facilities and regulators; and (ii) the failure to make, or identify, the kinds of changes in firm structure and practices that would be necessary to enhance the prospects for orderly resolution. 

Significantly, the FDIC determined that the 2013 Title I Resolution Plans submitted by the 11 institutions, including Citi, were “not credible” and did not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Federal Reserve Board determined that the plans of the 11 institutions were required to take immediate action to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC indicated that if the identified shortcomings were not addressed in the 2015 Title I Resolution Plan submissions, the agencies expected to use their authority under Title I, as discussed above. Like other similarly-situated institutions, Citi submitted its 2015 Title I Resolution Plan on July 1, 2015 and the industry has not yet received a formal response from the regulators.

Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Shareholders Substantially Depends on the CCAR Process and the Results of Regulatory Stress Tests. 

In addition to Board of Directors’ approval, any decision by Citi to return capital to shareholders, whether through an increase in its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program, substantially depends on regulatory approval, including through the CCAR process required by the Federal Reserve Board and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act. In March 2014, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it objected to the capital plan submitted by Citi as part of the 2014 CCAR process, meaning Citi was not able to increase its return of capital to shareholders as it had requested. Restrictions on Citi’s ability to return capital to shareholders as a result of the 2014 CCAR process negatively impacted market and investor perceptions of Citi, and continued restrictions could do so in the future.

Citi’s ability to accurately predict or explain to stakeholders the outcome of the CCAR process, and thus address any such market or investor perceptions, is difficult as the Federal Reserve Board’s assessment of Citi is conducted not only by using the Board’s proprietary stress test models, but also a number of qualitative factors, including a detailed assessment of Citi’s “capital adequacy process,” as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. These qualitative factors were cited by the Federal Reserve Board in its objection to Citi’s 2014 capital plan, and the Board has stated that it expects leading capital adequacy practices will continue to evolve and will likely be determined by the Board each year as a result of its cross-firm review of capital plan submissions.

Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing requirements, several parameters of the annual stress testing process may be altered from time to time, including the severity of the stress test scenario, Federal Reserve Board modeling of Citi’s balance sheet and the addition of components deemed important by the Federal Reserve Board (e.g., a counterparty failure). In addition, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that it may consider that some or all of Citi’s GSIB surcharge be integrated into its post-stress test minimum capital requirements. These parameter and other alterations could further increase the level of capital Citi must meet as 

54

part of the stress tests, thus potentially impacting the level of capital returns to shareholders.

Further, because it is not clear how the Federal Reserve Board’s proprietary stress test models may differ from the modeling techniques employed by Citi, it is possible that Citi’s stress test results (using its own models, estimation methodologies and processes) may not be consistent with those disclosed by the Federal Reserve Board, thus potentially leading to additional confusion and impacts to Citi’s perception in the market.

Citi, Its Management and Businesses Must Continually Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing Regulatory Changes and Uncertainties in the U.S. and Globally. 

Despite the adoption of final regulations in numerous areas impacting Citi and its businesses over the past several years, including final U.S. Basel III capital rules, certain derivatives reforms and restrictions on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule, Citi, its management and businesses continually face ongoing regulatory changes and uncertainties, both in the U.S. and globally. 

While the areas of ongoing regulatory changes and uncertainties facing Citi are too numerous to list completely, various examples include, but are not limited to: (i) limits on the level of credit risk Citi may have against certain counterparties; (ii) potential changes to various aspects of the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi (see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” above); (iii) financial transaction taxes and/or other types of increased fees on financial institutions; (iv) international versions of the Volcker Rule and bank structural reforms; (v) whether and to what extent the European Union and CFTC will render any “equivalency” determinations or regulatory acknowledgment of the equivalency of derivatives regimes; (vi) U.S. and international requirements relating to sanctions against Russia, Iran and other countries; and (vii) the U.S. banking agencies’ rules relating to the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR (see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below). There may also be regulatory changes not yet contemplated, or changes that have been proposed which could take a dramatically different form upon finalization. 

Moreover, certain recent regulatory changes, while final, remain in the implementation period, and it remains uncertain what ultimate impact such changes will have on Citi’s businesses, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in October and December 2015, the U.S. banking regulators and CFTC, respectively, adopted final rules relating to margin requirements for uncleared swaps. The final rules, which have a three-year phase-in period beginning on September 1, 2016, will require Citi to both collect and post margin to counterparties, as well as collect and post margin to certain of its affiliates, in connection with any uncleared swap, with the initial margin required to be held by unaffiliated third-party custodians. While Citi continues to work through the implications of the final rules, it is likely these requirements will significantly increase the cost to Citi and its counterparties of conducting uncleared swaps and impact its current inter-affiliate swap practices (e.g., require clearing of 

more inter-affiliate swaps and/or enter into risk management swaps with third parties). 

Ongoing regulatory changes and uncertainties make Citi’s and its management’s long-term business, balance sheet and budget planning difficult or subject to change, and can negatively impact Citi’s results of operations, financial condition and, potentially, its strategy or organizational structure. In addition, in many cases, business planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules, requirements or outcomes and is further complicated by management’s continual need to review and evaluate the impact on Citi’s businesses of ongoing rule proposals, final rules and implementation guidance from numerous regulatory bodies worldwide, which such guidance can change. Moreover, in many instances U.S. and international regulatory initiatives have not been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis, and areas of divergence have developed with respect to the scope, interpretation, timing, structure or approach, leading to inconsistent or even conflicting regulations, including within a single jurisdiction. Regulatory changes have also significantly increased Citi’s compliance risks and costs (see “Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risks” below).

CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS

Citi’s Results of Operations Could Be Negatively Impacted as Its Revolving Home Equity Lines of Credit Continue to “Reset.”

As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s home equity loan portfolio included approximately $12.3 billion of home equity lines of credit that were still within their revolving period and had not commenced amortization, or “reset” (Revolving HELOCs). Of these Revolving HELOCs, approximately 66% will commence amortization during 2016 and 2017 (for additional information, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below).

Before commencing amortization, Revolving HELOC borrowers are required to pay only interest on their loans. Upon amortization, these borrowers are required to pay both interest, usually at a variable rate, and principal that typically amortizes over 20 years, rather than the typical 30-year amortization. As a result, Citi’s customers with Revolving HELOCs that reset could experience “payment shock” due to the higher required payments on the loans. Increases in interest rates could further increase these payments, given the variable nature of the interest rates on these loans post-reset.

Citi has experienced a higher 30+ days past due delinquency rate on its amortizing home equity loans as compared to its total outstanding home equity loan portfolio (amortizing and non-amortizing). Moreover, resets to date have generally occurred during a period of historically low interest rates, which Citi believes has likely reduced the overall payment shock to borrowers. While Citi continues to monitor this reset risk closely and will continue to consider any potential impact in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves, as well as review and take additional actions to offset potential reset risk, increasing interest rates, stricter lending criteria and high borrower loan-to-value positions could limit 

55

Citi’s ability to reduce or mitigate this reset risk going forward. Accordingly, as these loans further reset during 2016 and 2017, Citi could continue to experience higher delinquency rates as well as increased loan loss reserves and net credit losses in future periods, which could negatively impact its results of operations.

Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Challenges Globally Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Businesses and Results of Operations.

Citi has experienced, and could experience in the future, negative impacts to its businesses and results of operations as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, uncertainties and volatility. 

Energy and other commodity prices significantly deteriorated during the second half of 2015 and into 2016, which has impacted various financial markets, countries and industries. Global economic growth remains uneven and uncertain. Various regions or countries, including certain emerging markets, have experienced slower or no growth and volatility, whether due to macroeconomic conditions or geopolitical tensions, governmental or regulatory policies or economic conditions within the particular region or country. For example, the economic and fiscal situations of several European countries remain fragile, and geopolitical tensions throughout the region, including in Russia and the Middle East, have added to the uncertainties. While concerns relating to sovereign defaults or a partial or complete break-up of the European Monetary Union (EMU), including potential accompanying redenomination risks and uncertainties, seemed to have abated somewhat in recent years, concerns and uncertainties have surfaced in Europe over the potential exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union in 2016. In addition, governmental fiscal and monetary actions, or expected actions, have impacted the volatilities of global financial markets and foreign exchange rates. 

These and other global macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, uncertainties and volatilities have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, Citi’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including its credit costs, revenues in its Markets and securities services and other businesses, and AOCI (which can in turn negatively impact Citi’s book and tangible book value). Further, if the economic situation in a non-U.S. jurisdiction where Citi operates were to deteriorate below a certain level, U.S. regulators can and have imposed mandatory loan loss and other reserve requirements on Citi, which could negatively impact its cost of credit and earnings, perhaps significantly.

Citi’s Significant Presence in the Emerging Markets Subjects It to Various Risks as well as Increased Compliance and Regulatory Risks and Costs.

During 2015, emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately 41% of Citi’s total revenues (for additional information on how Citi defines the emerging markets as well as its exposures in certain of these markets, see “Managing Global Risk—Country Risk” below).

Citi’s significant presence in the emerging markets subjects it to a number of risks, including sovereign volatility, 

political events, foreign exchange controls, limitations on foreign investment, sociopolitical instability (including from hyper-inflation), fraud, nationalization or loss of licenses, business restrictions, sanctions or asset freezes, potential criminal charges, closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation of assets. For example, Citi operates in several countries that have, or have had in the recent past, strict foreign exchange controls, such as Argentina and Venezuela, that limit its ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and/or transfer funds outside the country. Citi has also previously discovered fraud in certain emerging markets in which it operates in prior years. Political turmoil and other instability have occurred in certain countries, such as in Russia, Ukraine and the Middle East, which have required management time and attention (e.g., monitoring the impact of sanctions on the Russian economy as well as Citi’s businesses and results of operations). 

Citi’s emerging markets presence also increases its compliance and regulatory risks and costs. For example, Citi’s operations in emerging markets, including facilitating cross-border transactions on behalf of its clients, subject it to higher compliance risks under U.S. regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, such as anti-money-laundering regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These risks can be more acute in less developed markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of Citi’s business activities. Any failure by Citi to comply with applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which it operates as a result of its global footprint, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations and its reputation.

Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses. 

Concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market risk, can increase Citi’s risk of significant losses. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies (for additional information, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Citi also routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign exchange transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment banks, government and central banks and other financial institutions. To the extent regulatory or market developments lead to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, this could also increase Citi’s concentration of risk in this industry. Concentrations of risk can limit, and have limited, the effectiveness of Citi’s hedging strategies and have caused Citi to incur significant losses, and they may do so again in the future.

LIQUIDITY RISKS

The Federal Reserve Board’s Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Proposal Includes Uncertainties and Potential Operational Difficulties That Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Funding and Liquidity, Costs of Funds and Results of Operations. 

Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act grants the FDIC the authority, under certain circumstances, to resolve systemically important financial institutions, including Citi. The FDIC has released a notice describing its preferred “single point of entry strategy” for such resolution, pursuant to which, generally, a bank holding company would be placed in receivership, the unsecured long-term debt of the holding company would bear losses and the operating subsidiaries would be recapitalized. 

Consistent with this strategy, in November 2015, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to require GSIBs, including Citi, to (i) issue and maintain minimum levels of external “total loss-absorbing capacity” (TLAC) and long-term debt (LTD), and (ii) adhere to various “clean holding company” requirements at the bank holding company level, including a prohibition on third-party short-term borrowings, derivatives and other qualified financial contracts and certain guarantees, as well as a limit on other non-TLAC eligible liabilities, such as structured notes and other operating liabilities. While not included in its proposed requirements, the Federal Reserve Board also indicated it was considering additional domestic internal TLAC requirements for U.S. GSIBs which could require, among other things, the “pre-positioning” of specified amounts of TLAC to certain material subsidiaries of the bank holding company (for a summary of the TLAC proposal, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below). 

There are significant uncertainties and interpretive issues arising from the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal. With respect to the minimum external LTD and TLAC requirements, the proposal would disqualify from eligible LTD securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or non-payment of principal or interest as well as securities not governed by U.S. law. Consistent with industry standards, the vast majority of Citi’s otherwise eligible outstanding LTD provides for acceleration in circumstances other than those permitted by the proposal. Additionally, Citi has outstanding a significant amount of LTD not governed by U.S. law but which would otherwise be eligible to count towards the minimum external LTD requirement. Accordingly, if the requirements are adopted as proposed, and no “grandfathering” of existing outstanding LTD is provided, Citi could be required to refinance or issue significant amounts of additional debt, simultaneously with other GSIBs impacted by the requirements. Further, such ineligible debt securities would count against the limit imposed on non-TLAC liabilities imposed under the clean holding company requirements of the proposal, likely resulting in the need to repurchase significant amounts of Citi’s outstanding debt in order not to be in breach of such limitations. Any of these actions could negatively and significantly impact Citi’s funding and liquidity management and planning, operations and costs of funds. 

The clean holding company requirements pose additional operational challenges and uncertainties. Citi, like many bank holding companies, often guarantees the obligations of its subsidiaries, which guarantees include a default right linked to the insolvency of Citi (i.e., downstream guarantees with cross-default provisions). With no grandfathering of such guarantees contemplated by the proposal, restructuring, revising or replacing the extensive number of guarantees outstanding in order to meet the clean holding company requirements could be costly and expose Citi to legal risk. Further, the potential consequences of breaching the proposed clean holding company requirements, as well as the consequences of not meeting many of the other requirements in the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal, are not clear, including what would be required to cure and the timeframe to do so. 

In addition, any requirement to pre-position TLAC-eligible instruments with material subsidiaries could result in additional funding inefficiencies, increase Citi’s overall minimum TLAC requirements by reducing the fungibility of its funding sources and require certain of Citi’s subsidiaries to replace lower cost funding with other higher cost funding, which would further impede Citi’s funding and liquidity management and planning, costs of funds and results of operations.

The Maintenance of Adequate Liquidity and Funding Depends on Numerous Factors, Including Those Outside of Citi’s Control, Such as Market Disruptions and Increases in Citi’s Credit Spreads.

As a global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s liquidity and sources of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets, governmental fiscal and monetary policies, regulatory changes or negative investor perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness.

In addition, Citi’s cost and ability to obtain deposits, secured funding and long-term unsecured funding are directly related to its credit spreads. Changes in credit spreads constantly occur and are market driven, including both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, and can be highly volatile. Citi’s credit spreads may also be influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to Citi’s long-term debt, which are also impacted by these external and Citi-specific factors. Moreover, Citi’s ability to obtain funding may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time, or if market appetite is reduced, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis. In addition, clearing organizations, regulators, clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may exercise the right to require additional collateral based on these market perceptions or market conditions, which could further impair Citi’s access to and cost of funding.

As a holding company, Citi relies on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be 

57

subject to capital adequacy or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements or potential domestic internal TLAC requirements (as discussed above). Limitations on the payments that Citi receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity.

The Credit Rating Agencies Continuously Review the Credit Ratings of Citi and Certain of Its Subsidiaries, and Ratings Downgrades Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Funding and Liquidity Due to Reduced Funding Capacity and Increased Funding Costs, Including Derivatives Triggers That Could Require Cash Obligations or Collateral Requirements. 

The credit rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citi and its more significant subsidiaries’ long-term/senior debt and short-term/commercial paper, as applicable, are based on a number of factors, including standalone financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies’ proprietary rating agency methodologies and assumptions and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally.

Citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades could negatively impact Citi’s ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as the costs of those funds, and its ability to maintain certain deposits. A ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on other funding sources, such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there are no explicit triggers, as well as on contractual provisions, which contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for Citi to hold third-party funds.

Moreover, credit ratings downgrades can have impacts, which may not be currently known to Citi or which are not possible to quantify. For example, some entities may have ratings limitations as to their permissible counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be aware. In addition, certain of Citi’s corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of certain contracts or market instruments with Citi in response to ratings downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only Citi’s funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citi’s or Citibank, N.A.’s credit ratings, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Citi Has Co-Branding and Private Label Credit Card Relationships with Various Retailers and Merchants and the Failure to Maintain These Relationships or the Renewal of These Relationships on Less Favorable Terms Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s Results of Operations or Financial Condition.

Through its Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services credit card businesses, Citi has co-branding and private label relationships with various retailers and merchants globally in the ordinary course of business whereby Citi issues credit cards to customers of the retailers or merchants. Citi’s co-branding and private label agreements provide for shared economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term. The five largest relationships constituted an aggregate of approximately 10% of Citi’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Competition among card issuers, including Citi, for these relationships is significant. As a result, Citi may not be able to renew these relationships, or the relationships may be renewed on terms substantially less favorable to Citi’s credit card businesses. These relationships could also be negatively impacted due to, among other things, operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant, termination due to a breach by Citi, the retailer or merchant of its responsibilities, or external factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. While various mitigating factors could be available to Citi if any of these events were to occur - such as by replacing the retailer or merchant or offering new card products - such events could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations or financial condition. 

Citi’s Operational Systems and Networks Have Been, and Will Continue to Be, Subject to an Increasing Risk of Continually Evolving Cybersecurity or Other Technological Risks Which Could Result in the Theft, Loss, Misuse or Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer Information, Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs to Citi, Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.

A significant portion of Citi’s operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information as well as the monitoring of a large number of complex transactions on a minute-by-minute basis. For example, through its Global Consumer Banking, credit card and securities services businesses, Citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and client-specific information for its retail, corporate and governmental customers and clients and must accurately record and reflect their extensive account transactions. With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet and mobile devices to conduct financial transactions, large, global financial institutions such as Citi have been, and will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities.

Citi’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to ongoing cyber incidents such as unauthorized access; loss or destruction of data (including confidential 

58

client information); account takeovers; unavailability of service; computer viruses or other malicious code; cyber attacks; and other events. These threats arise from numerous sources, not all of which are in Citi’s control, including among others human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to Citi’s property or assets, natural disasters or severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. 

Additional challenges are posed by external parties, including extremist parties and certain foreign state actors that engage in cyber activities as a means to promote political ends. As further evidence of the increasing and potentially significant impact of cyber incidents, during 2015, the U.S. government as well as several multinational companies reported cyber incidents affecting their computer systems that resulted in the data of millions of customers and employees being compromised. In addition, in recent years several U.S. retailers and financial institutions and other multinational companies reported cyber incidents that compromised customer data.

While Citi has not been materially impacted by these reported or other cyber incidents, Citi has been subject to other intentional cyber incidents from external sources over the last several years, including (i) denial of service attacks, which attempted to interrupt service to clients and customers; (ii) data breaches, which obtained unauthorized access to customer account data; and (iii) malicious software attacks on client systems, which attempted to allow unauthorized entrance to Citi’s systems under the guise of a client and the extraction of client data. While Citi’s monitoring and protection services were able to detect and respond to the incidents targeting its systems before they became significant, they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale.

Although Citi devotes significant resources to implement, maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with measures such as intrusion detection and prevention and firewalls to safeguard critical business applications, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. In addition, because the methods used to cause cyber attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched, Citi may be unable to implement effective preventive measures or proactively address these methods until they are discovered.

If Citi were to be subject to a cyber incident, it could result in the disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary client information, damage to Citi’s reputation with its clients and the market, customer dissatisfaction, additional costs to Citi (such as repairing systems, replacing customer payment cards or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties, exposure to litigation and other financial losses to both Citi and its clients and customers. Such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in the 

operations of Citi (such as the lack of availability of Citi’s online banking system or mobile banking platform), as well as the operations of its clients, customers or other third parties. Given Citi’s global footprint and the high volume of transactions processed by Citi, certain errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified, which would further increase these costs and consequences.

Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which Citi’s customers do business, may also be sources of cybersecurity or other operational and technological risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s security and control systems. Citi outsources certain functions, such as processing customer credit card transactions, uploading content on customer-facing websites, and developing software for new products and services. These relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by third-party hosting of or access to Citi websites, which could result in service disruptions or website defacements, a risk the confidentiality, privacy and security of data held by third parties may be compromised and the potential to introduce vulnerable code, resulting in security breaches impacting Citi customers. While Citi engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing, such as performing onsite security control assessments and limiting third-party access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job functions, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data or other cyber incidents with increased costs and consequences to Citi such as those discussed above. Furthermore, because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, including as a result of the derivatives reforms over the last few years, Citi has increased exposure to operational failure or cyber attacks through third parties.

While Citi maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.

Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the Negative Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital, Will Be Driven by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable Income.

At December 31, 2015, Citi’s net DTAs were approximately $47.8 billion, of which approximately $31.0 billion was excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, on a fully implemented basis, under the U.S. Basel III rules (for additional information, see “Capital Resources—Components of Citigroup Capital Under Basel III (Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)” above). In addition, of the net DTAs as of year-end 2015, approximately $15.9 billion related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards (FTCs). The carry-forward utilization period for FTCs is 10 years and represents the most time-sensitive component of Citi’s DTAs. Of the FTCs at year-end 2015, approximately $4.8 billion expire in 2018 and the remaining $11.1 billion expire over the period of 

59

2019-2025. Citi must utilize any FTCs generated in the then-current year tax return prior to utilizing any carry-forward FTCs.

The accounting treatment for realization of DTAs, including FTCs, is complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax planning strategies. Citi’s ability to utilize its DTAs, including the FTC components, and thus use the capital supporting the DTAs for more productive purposes, will be dependent upon Citi’s ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant tax carry-forward periods. Failure to realize any portion of the DTAs would also have a corresponding negative impact on Citi’s net income.

In addition, with regard to FTCs, utilization will be influenced by actions to optimize U.S. taxable earnings for the purpose of consuming the FTC carry-forward component of the DTAs prior to expiration. These FTC actions, however, may serve to increase the DTAs for other less time sensitive components. Moreover, tax return limitations on FTCs and general business credits that cause Citi to incur current tax expense, notwithstanding its tax carry-forward position, could impact the rate of overall DTA utilization. DTA utilization will also continue to be driven by movements in Citi’s AOCI, which can be impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

For additional information on Citi’s DTAs, including the FTCs, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” below and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Extensive Tax Laws to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of the Relevant Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in the Payment of Additional Taxes, Penalties or Interest.

Citi is subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as the numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are inherently complex and Citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to its entities, operations and businesses. Citi’s interpretations and application of the tax laws, including with respect to withholding tax obligations and stamp and other transactional taxes, could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, which could be material.

The Value of Citi’s DTAs Could Be Significantly Reduced if Corporate Tax Rates in the U.S. or Certain State, Local or Foreign Jurisdictions Decline or as a Result of Other Changes in the U.S. Corporate Tax System.

There have been discussions regarding decreasing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. Similar discussions have taken place in certain local, state and foreign jurisdictions. While Citi may benefit in some respects from any decrease in corporate tax rates, a reduction in the U.S. federal, or state, local or foreign corporate tax rates could result in a decrease, perhaps significant, in the value of Citi’s DTAs, which would result in 

a reduction to Citi’s net income during the period in which the change is enacted. There have also been recent discussions of more sweeping changes to the U.S. tax system. It is uncertain whether or when any such tax reform proposals will be enacted into law, and whether or how they will affect Citi’s DTAs.

If Citi’s Risk Models Are Ineffective or Require Modification or Enhancement, Citi Could Incur Significant Losses or Its Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios Could Be Negatively Impacted. 

Citi utilizes models extensively as part of its risk management and mitigation strategies, including in analyzing and monitoring the various risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For example, Citi uses models as part of its various stress testing initiatives across the firm. Management of these risks is made even more challenging within a global financial institution such as Citi, particularly given the complex, diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which Citi operates.

These models and strategies are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in many circumstances, and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Citi could incur significant losses if its risk management models or strategies are ineffective in properly anticipating or managing these risks.

Moreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, including its credit, market and operational risk models, continue to be subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking agencies regarding the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk-weighted assets, total leverage exposure or other components of Citi’s capital ratios. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s capital ratios and its ability to achieve its regulatory capital requirements as it projects or as required. 

Citi Must Continually Pursue Expense Management and Its Investments in Its Businesses May Not Be as Successful as Citi Projects or Expects. 

Citi continues to pursue its disciplined expense management strategy, including ongoing repositioning and efficiency targets. However, there is no guarantee that Citi will be able to maintain or reduce its level of expenses as a result of its repositioning actions, efficiency initiatives or otherwise. Moreover, Citi’s ability to maintain or reduce its expenses in part depends on factors which it cannot control, such as ongoing regulatory changes, continued higher regulatory and compliance costs, legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and macroeconomic conditions, among others. In addition, investments Citi has made, or may make, in its businesses or operations, such as those in technology systems 

60

or in its U.S. credit card businesses, may not be as productive or effective as Citi expects or at all. 

Citi’s Ability to Continue to Wind-Down Citi Holdings Largely Depends on Factors Outside Its Control.  

While Citi made significant progress in continuing to wind-down Citi Holdings in 2015, and Citi expects to maintain Citi Holdings at or above “break even” in 2016, as of December 31, 2015, the remaining assets in Citi Holdings largely consisted of North America legacy consumer mortgages, of which approximately 50% consisted of home equity loans for which a market for sales has not yet developed. Accordingly, sales of the remaining mortgage assets will largely continue to be subject to ongoing run-off, market appetite and/or opportunistic sales. As a result, the remaining assets in Citi Holdings will not likely decrease as significantly as in prior years and could continue to have a negative impact on Citi’s risk-weighted assets. 

Citi’s Performance and the Performance of Its Individual Businesses Could Be Negatively Impacted if Citi Is Not Able to Hire and Retain Highly Qualified Employees for Any Reason.

Citi’s performance and the performance of its individual businesses is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled employees. Specifically, Citi’s continued ability to compete in its businesses, to manage its businesses effectively and to continue to execute its overall global strategy depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. If Citi is unable to continue to attract and retain the most highly qualified employees for any reason, Citi’s performance, including its competitive position, the successful execution of its overall strategy and its results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees depends on numerous factors, some of which are outside of its control. For example, given the heightened regulatory and political environment in which Citi operates relative to competitors for talent both within and outside of the financial services area, it may be more difficult for Citi to hire or retain highly qualified employees in the future. Other factors that impact Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees include its culture, compensation, the management and leadership of the company as well as its individual businesses, Citi’s presence in the particular market or region at issue and the professional opportunities it offers. Generally, the banking industry is subject to more stringent regulation of executive and employee compensation than other industries, including deferral and clawback requirements for incentive compensation and other limitations. Citi often competes in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to such significant regulatory restrictions on the structure of incentive compensation. 

Incorrect Assumptions or Estimates in Citi’s Financial Statements Could Cause Significant Unexpected Losses in the Future, and Changes to Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact on How Citi Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Citi is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements under U.S. GAAP, including determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and regulatory exposures, valuation of DTAs and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If Citi’s assumptions or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual future events, Citi could experience unexpected losses, some of which could be significant.

Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently reviewing, or has proposed or issued, changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of Citi’s financial statements or interpretations thereof, including those areas where Citi is required to make assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB has proposed a new accounting model intended to require earlier recognition of credit losses on financial instruments. The proposed accounting model would require that lifetime “expected credit losses” on financial assets not recorded at fair value through net income, such as loans and held-to-maturity securities, be recorded at inception of the financial asset, replacing the multiple existing impairment models under U.S. GAAP which generally require that a loss be “incurred” before it is recognized (for additional information on this and other proposed changes, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, could present operational challenges and could require Citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

61

COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT AND LEGAL RISKS 

Ongoing Implementation and Interpretation of Regulatory Changes and Requirements in the U.S. and Globally Have Increased Citi’s Compliance Risks and Costs.

As referenced above, over the past several years, Citi has been required to implement a significant number of regulatory changes across all of its businesses and functions, and these changes continue. In some cases, Citi’s implementation of a regulatory requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance, legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal final rules. Moreover, in many cases, these are entirely new regulatory requirements or regimes, resulting in much uncertainty regarding regulatory expectations as to what is definitely required in order to be in compliance with the requirements. Accompanying this compliance uncertainty is heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the U.S. and globally for the financial services industry with respect to governance and risk management practices, including its compliance and regulatory risks (for a discussion of heightened regulatory expectations on “conduct risk” at, and the overall “culture” of, financial institutions such as Citi, see “Legal Risks” below). All of these factors have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs for Citi.

Examples of regulatory changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include: 

•The Volcker Rule required Citi to develop an extensive global compliance regime, including developing and maintaining detailed trading and permitted activity mandates for businesses, submitting extensive trading information to regulatory agencies, conducting independent testing and audit, training, recordkeeping and similar requirements and governance, including an annual CEO attestation, beginning on March 31, 2016, with respect to the global processes Citi has in place to achieve compliance with the rules. 

•Numerous aspects of the U.S. derivatives reform regime require extensive compliance systems and processes to be maintained by Citi on a global basis, including electronic recordkeeping, real-time public transaction reporting and external business conduct requirements (e.g., required swap counterparty disclosures). 

•A proliferation of data protection and “onshoring” requirements adopted by various non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as in Russia, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia, require Citi to take measures to ensure client data is stored or processed within national borders. These requirements could conflict with anti-money laundering and other requirements in other jurisdictions. 

Extensive compliance requirements can result in increased reputational and legal risks, as failure to comply with regulations and requirements, or failure to comply as expected, can result in enforcement and/or regulatory proceedings (for additional discussion, see “Legal Risks” below). In addition, increased and ongoing compliance requirements and uncertainties have resulted in higher costs for Citi. For example, Citi employed approximately 30,000 regulatory and compliance staff as of year-end 2015, out of a 

total employee population of 231,000, compared to approximately 14,000 as of year-end 2008 with a total employee population of 323,000. These higher regulatory and compliance costs also offset Citi’s ongoing cost reduction initiatives. For example, data protection and “onshoring” requirements often require redundant investments in local data storage and security and thus impede or potentially reverse Citi’s centralization or standardization efforts, which provide expense efficiencies. Higher compliance costs may also require management to reallocate resources, including potentially away from ongoing business investment initiatives. 

Citi Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries That Could Result in Significant Penalties and Other Negative Impacts on Citi, Its Businesses and Results of Operations. 

At any given time, Citi is defending a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations and other inquiries. The frequency with which such proceedings, investigations and inquiries are initiated have increased substantially over the last few years, and the global judicial, regulatory and political environment generally remains hostile to large financial institutions. For example, under recent guidance by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), a corporation (such as Citi) is required to identify all individuals involved in or responsible for perceived misconduct at issue and provide all related facts and circumstances in order to qualify for any cooperation credit in civil and criminal investigations of corporate wrongdoing. The complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of Citi’s operations, also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. 

Moreover, U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been increasingly focused on “conduct risk,” a term that is used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third-party vendors utilized by Citi, that could harm consumers, investors or the markets, such as failures to safeguard consumers’ and investors’ personal information, failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest and improperly creating, selling and marketing products and services. In addition to increasing Citi’s compliance risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings and litigation, including for practices which historically were acceptable but are now receiving greater scrutiny. Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm customers, investors or the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms, including Citi. In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in Citi’s culture, such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings. 

62

Further, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which Citi is subject has increased substantially in recent years. U.S. and certain international governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions from, financial institutions, and criminal prosecutors in the U.S. have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements against corporate entities and other criminal sanctions from those institutions. As previously disclosed, in May 2015 an affiliate of Citi entered into a settlement with the DOJ whereby the affiliate pleaded guilty to an antitrust violation and paid a substantial fine to resolve the DOJ’s investigations into Citi’s foreign exchange business practices. These types of actions by U.S. and international governmental entities may, in the future, have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers and business, and the inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies, consent orders, substantial fines and penalties or other requirements in the future, including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of which could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, business practices, financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi’s operations or cause Citi reputational harm. 

 Further, many large claims asserted against Citi are highly complex, slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, these accruals, involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued. In addition, certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved.

For additional information relating to Citi’s legal and regulatory proceedings and matters, including Citi’s policies on establishing legal accruals, see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

OVERVIEW

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition, the key principles that guide it, and Citi's risk appetite. 

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical culture. Under Citi’s mission and value proposition, which was developed by Citi’s senior leadership and distributed throughout the firm, Citi strives to serve as a trusted partner to its clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all employees to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in clients’ interests, create economic value and are always systemically responsible. Additionally, Citi evaluates employees’ performance against behavioral expectations set out in Citi’s leadership standards, which were designed in part to effectuate Citi’s mission and value proposition. Other culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics and leadership, escalation, and treating customers fairly help Citi to execute its mission and value proposition. 

Four key principles—common purpose, responsible finance, ingenuity, and leadership—guide Citi as it performs its mission. Citi’s risk appetite, which is approved by the Citigroup Board of Directors, specifies the aggregate levels and types of risk the Board and management are willing to assume to achieve Citi’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. 

Citi selectively takes risks in support of its underlying business strategy, while striving to ensure it operates within its mission and value proposition and risk appetite. 

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows:

•Credit risk is the risk arising from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk is found in all activities in which settlement or repayment depends on counterparty, issuer, or borrower performance.

•Liquidity risk is the risk arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from a failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect Citi’s ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value.

•Market risk is the risk of potential losses arising from changes in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables, such as interest rates. 

•Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, or human factors, or from external events.

•Country risk is the risk that an event in a country (precipitated by developments within or external to a country) will impair the value of Citi’s franchise or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that country to honor their obligations. Country risk events may include sovereign defaults, banking crises, currency crises, currency convertibility and/or transferability restrictions, or political events.

•Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, local, national, or cross-border laws, rules, or regulations, our own internal policies and procedures, or relevant standards of conduct.

•Conduct risk is the risk that Citi’s employees or agents may, intentionally or through negligence, harm customers, clients, or the integrity of the markets, and thereby the integrity of Citi.

•Legal risk includes the risk of loss, whether financial or reputational, due to legal or regulatory actions, proceedings, or investigations, or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws, or regulations.

•Reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion.

Citi manages its risks through each of its three lines of defense: (i) business management, (ii) independent control functions and (iii) Internal Audit. The three lines of defense collaborate with each other in structured forums and processes to bring various perspectives together and to steer the organization toward outcomes that are in clients’ interests, create economic value and are systemically responsible.

First Line of Defense: Business Management

Each of Citi’s businesses owns its risks and is responsible for assessing and managing its risks. Each business is also responsible for having controls in place to mitigate key risks, assessing internal controls and promoting a culture of compliance and control. In doing so, a business is required to maintain appropriate staffing and implement appropriate procedures to fulfill its risk governance responsibilities. 

The CEOs of each region and business report to the Citigroup CEO. The Head of Operations and Technology and the Head of Productivity, who are considered part of the first line of defense, also report to the Citigroup CEO. 

Businesses at Citi organize and chair many committees and councils that cover risk considerations with participation from independent control functions, including committees or councils that are designed to consider matters related to capital, assets and liabilities, business practices, business risks and controls, mergers and acquisitions, the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending and incentives.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Control Functions

Citi’s independent control functions, including Risk, Compliance, Human Resources, Legal and Finance, set 

65

standards by which Citi and its businesses are expected to manage and oversee risks, including compliance with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, policies and relevant standards of conduct. Additionally, among other responsibilities, the independent control functions provide advice and training to Citi’s businesses and establish tools, methodologies, processes and oversight for controls used by the businesses to foster a culture of compliance and control.

Risk 

The Risk organization is designed to act as an independent partner of the business to manage market, credit and operational risk in a manner consistent with Citi’s risk appetite. Risk establishes policies and guidelines for risk assessments and risk management and contributes to controls and tools to manage, measure and mitigate risks taken by the firm.

The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and the Risk Management Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer has regular and unrestricted access to the Risk Management Committee of the Board and also to the Citigroup Board of Directors to address risks and issues identified through Risk’s activities.

Compliance

The Compliance organization is designed to protect Citi not only by managing adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and other standards of conduct, but also by promoting business behavior that is consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition, the principle of responsible finance and Citi’s compliance risk appetite. For further information on Citi’s compliance risk appetite, see “Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risk” below.

The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and has regular and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee and other ad hoc committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors to report on, among other items, possible breaches of Citi’s compliance risk appetite.

Human Resources 

The Human Resources organization provides personnel support and governance in connection with, among other things: recognizing and rewarding employees who demonstrate Citi’s values and excel in their roles and responsibilities; setting ethical- and performance-related expectations and developing and promoting employees who meet those expectations; and searching for, assessing, and hiring staff who exemplify Citi’s leadership standards, which outline Citi’s expectations of its employees’ behavior. 

The Head of Human Resources reports to the Citigroup CEO and interacts regularly with the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Legal 

The Legal organization is involved in a number of activities designed to promote the appropriate management of Citi’s exposure to legal risk. Those activities include, among others: promoting and supporting Citigroup’s governance processes; advising businesses management, other independent control functions, the Citigroup Board of Directors and committees of the Board regarding analysis of laws and regulations, regulatory matters, disclosure matters, and potential risks and exposures on key litigation and transactional matters, among other things; advising other independent control functions in their efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as other internal standards of conduct; serving on key management committees; reporting and escalating key legal issues to senior management or other independent control functions; participating in internal investigations and overseeing regulatory investigations; and advising businesses on a day-to-day basis on legal, regulatory and contractual matters.

The General Counsel reports to the Citigroup CEO and is responsible to the full Citigroup Board. In addition to having regular and unrestricted access to the full Citigroup Board of Directors, the General Counsel, or his delegates, regularly attends meetings of the Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee, Operations and Technology Committee, and Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee as well as other ad hoc committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Finance

The Finance organization is primarily comprised of the following disciplines: treasury, controllers, tax and financial planning and analysis. These disciplines partner with the businesses, providing key data and consultation to facilitate sound decisions in support of the businesses’ objectives. Through these activities, Finance serves as an independent control function advising business management, escalating identified risks and establishing policies or processes to manage risk.

Through the treasury discipline, Finance has overall responsibility for managing Citi’s balance sheet and accordingly partners with the businesses to manage Citi’s liquidity and interest rate risk (price risk for non-trading portfolios). Treasury works with the businesses to establish balance sheet targets and limits, as well as sets policies on funding costs charged for business assets based on their liquidity and duration. 

Principally through the controllers discipline, Finance is responsible for establishing a strong control environment over Citi’s financial reporting processes consistent with the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Finance is led by Citi’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who reports directly to the Citigroup CEO. The CFO chairs or co-chairs several management committees that serve as key governance and oversight forums for business activities. In addition, the CFO has regular and unrestricted access to the 

66

full Citigroup Board of Directors as well as to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit

Citi’s Internal Audit function independently reviews activities of the first two lines of defense based on a risk-based audit plan and methodology approved by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Internal Audit also provides independent assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators regarding the effectiveness of Citi’s governance and controls designed to mitigate Citi’s exposure to risks and to enhance Citi’s culture of compliance and control. 

The Chief Auditor reports functionally to the Chairman of the Citigroup Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO of Citigroup. Internal Audit’s responsibilities are carried out independently under the oversight of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit’s employees accordingly report to the Chief Auditor and do not have reporting lines to front-line units or senior management. Internal Audit’s staff members are not permitted to provide internal-audit services for a business line or function in which they had business line or function responsibilities within the previous 12 months.

67

Citigroup Board of Directors and Committees of the Board

Citigroup’s Board of Directors oversees Citi’s risk-taking activities. To do so, directors review risk assessments and reports prepared by Risk, Compliance, Human Resources, Legal, Finance and Internal Audit and exercise independent judgment to question, challenge, and when necessary, oppose recommendations and decisions made by senior management that could cause Citi’s risk profile to exceed its risk appetite or jeopardize the safety and soundness of the firm. 

The standing committees of the Citigroup Board of Directors are the Executive Committee, Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee, Operations and Technology Committee and Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee. In addition to the standing committees, the Board creates ad hoc committees from time to time in response to regulatory, legal, or other requirements.

68

CREDIT RISK

OVERVIEW

Credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business activities, including:

•wholesale and retail lending; 

•capital markets derivative transactions; 

•structured finance; and 

•repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions.

Credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as an institution. As a result, Citi has a well-established framework in place for managing credit risk across all businesses. This includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits and credit policies, both at the business level as well as at the company-wide level. Citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and policies with respect to problem recognition, including “watch lists,” portfolio review, updated risk ratings and classification triggers. 

With respect to Citi’s settlement and clearing activities, intra-day client usage of lines is closely monitored against limits, as well as against “normal” usage patterns. To the extent a problem develops, Citi typically moves the client to a secured (collateralized) operating model. Generally, Citi’s intra-day settlement and clearing lines are uncommitted and cancellable at any time.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi has in place a concentration management framework consisting of industry limits, obligor limits and single-name triggers. In addition, the independent Risk organization reviews concentration of risk across Citi’s regions and businesses to assist in managing this type of risk.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as well as loan and other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of the creditworthiness of the obligor, as well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its loan loss reserve process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as through regular stress testing at the company, business, geography and product levels. These stress-testing processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would 

occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties.

For additional information on Citi’s credit risk management, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

CONSUMER CREDIT

North America Consumer Mortgage Lending

Overview

Citi’s North America consumer mortgage portfolio consists of both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. At December 31, 2015, Citi’s North America consumer mortgage portfolio was $79.7 billion (compared to $95.9 billion at December 31, 2014), of which the residential first mortgage portfolio was $56.9 billion (compared to $67.8 billion at December 31, 2014), and the home equity loan portfolio was $22.8 billion (compared to $28.1 billion at December 31, 2014). The decline during the year was primarily attributed to $14.7 billion of North America consumer mortgages sold or transferred to held-for-sale, including $6.6 billion of CitiFinancial consumer mortgages ($5.4 billion of residential first mortgages and $1.2 billion of home equity loans) transferred to held-for-sale and classified as Other assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2015, $18.7 billion of residential first mortgages were recorded in Citi Holdings, with the remaining $38.2 billion recorded in Citicorp. At December 31, 2015, $19.1 billion of home equity loans was recorded in Citi Holdings, with the remaining $3.6 billion recorded in Citicorp. 

Citi’s residential first mortgage portfolio included $3.4 billion of loans with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guarantees at December 31, 2015, compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2014. The decline during the year was primarily due to mortgage loans with FHA insurance sold or transferred to held-for-sale. Citi’s FHA/VA portfolio consists of loans to low-to-moderate-income borrowers with lower FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) scores and generally higher loan-to-value ratios (LTVs). Credit losses on FHA loans are borne by the sponsoring governmental agency, provided that the insurance terms have not been rescinded as a result of an origination defect. With respect to VA loans, the VA establishes a loan-level loss cap, beyond which Citi is liable for loss. While FHA and VA loans have high delinquency rates, given the insurance and guarantees, respectively, Citi has experienced negligible credit losses on these loans.

As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s North America residential first mortgage portfolio contained approximately $2.4 billion of adjustable rate mortgages that are currently required to make a payment consisting of only accrued interest for the payment period, or an interest-only payment, compared to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2014. This decline resulted primarily from repayments and conversions to amortizing loans. Residential first mortgages with this payment feature are primarily to high-credit-quality borrowers who have on 

69

average significantly higher origination and refreshed FICO scores than other loans in the residential first mortgage portfolio, and have exhibited significantly lower 30+ delinquency rates as compared with residential first mortgages without this payment feature. As such, Citi does not believe the residential mortgage loans with this payment feature represent substantially higher risk in the portfolio.

Citi does not offer option-adjustable rate mortgages/negative-amortizing mortgage products to its customers. As a result, option-adjustable rate mortgages/negative-amortizing mortgages represent an insignificant portion of total balances, since they were acquired only incidentally as part of prior portfolio and business purchases.

For additional information on Citi’s North America consumer mortgage portfolio, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)Decrease in 4Q’15 primarily reflects the transfer of CFNA residential first mortgages to held-for-sale and classification as Other assets at year-end 2015.

Net credit losses in the North America residential first mortgage portfolio continued to improve during 2015 as a result of improvements in the home price index (HPI) and sales or transfers to held-for-sale of residential first mortgages during 2015, as well as overall loss mitigation activities within CitiFinancial.

Residential first mortgages originated by CitiFinancial have a higher net credit loss rate as CitiFinancial borrowers tend to have higher LTVs and lower FICO scores than CitiMortgage borrowers. CitiFinancial’s residential first mortgages also have a significantly different geographic distribution, with different mortgage market conditions that tend to lag the overall improvements in HPI. 

70

During 2015, continued management actions, primarily the sale or transfer to held-for-sale of approximately $1.5 billion of delinquent residential first mortgages, including $0.9 billion in the fourth quarter largely associated with the transfer of CitiFinancial loans to held-for-sale referenced above, were the primary driver of the overall improvement in 

delinquencies within Citi Holdings’ residential first mortgage portfolio. Credit performance from quarter to quarter could continue to be impacted by the amount of delinquent loan sales or transfers to held-for-sale, as well as overall trends in HPI and interest rates.

(5)Improvement in state trends during 2015 was primarily due to the sale or transfer to held-for-sale of residential first mortgages, including the transfer of CitiFinancial residential first mortgages to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Foreclosures

A substantial majority of Citi’s foreclosure inventory consists of residential first mortgages. At December 31, 2015, Citi’s foreclosure inventory included approximately $0.1 billion, or 0.2%, of the total residential first mortgage portfolio, compared to $0.6 billion, or 0.9%, at December 31, 2014, based on the dollar amount of ending net receivables of loans in foreclosure inventory, excluding loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and loans subject to LTSCs.

North America Consumer Mortgage Quarterly Credit Trends—Net Credit Losses and Delinquencies—Home Equity Loans

Citi’s home equity loan portfolio consists of both fixed-rate home equity loans and loans extended under home equity lines of credit. Fixed-rate home equity loans are fully amortizing. Home equity lines of credit allow for amounts to be drawn for a period of time with the payment of interest only and then, at the end of the draw period, the then-outstanding amount is converted to an amortizing loan (the interest-only payment feature during the revolving period is standard for this product across the industry). After conversion, the home equity loans typically have a 20-year amortization period. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s home equity loan portfolio of $22.8 billion consisted of $6.3 billion of fixed-rate home equity loans and $16.5 billion of loans extended under home equity lines of credit (Revolving HELOCs).

71

Revolving HELOCs

As noted above, as of December 31, 2015, Citi had $16.5 billion of Revolving HELOCs, of which $4.2 billion had commenced amortization (compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2014) and $12.3 billion were still within their revolving period and have not commenced amortization, or “reset,” (compared to $16.7 billion at December 31, 2014). The following chart indicates the FICO and combined loan-to-value (CLTV) characteristics of Citi’s Revolving HELOCs portfolio and the year in which they reset:

North America Home Equity Lines of Credit Amortization – Citigroup

Total ENR by Reset Year

In billions of dollars as of December 31, 2015

Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding.

Approximately 25% of Citi’s total Revolving HELOCs portfolio had commenced amortization as of December 31, 2015 (compared to 10% as of December 31, 2014). Of the remaining Revolving HELOCs portfolio, approximately 66% will commence amortization during the period of 2016–2017. Before commencing amortization, Revolving HELOC borrowers are required to pay only interest on their loans. Upon amortization, these borrowers will be required to pay both interest, usually at a variable rate, and principal that amortizes typically over 20 years, rather than the typical 30-year amortization. As a result, Citi’s customers with Revolving HELOCs that reset could experience “payment shock” due to the higher required payments on the loans. 

While it is not certain what ultimate impact this payment shock could have on Citi’s delinquency rates and net credit losses, Citi currently estimates that the monthly loan payment for its Revolving HELOCs that reset during the period of 2016–2017 could increase on average by approximately $370, or 165%. Increases in interest rates could further increase these payments given the variable nature of the interest rates on these loans post-reset. Of the Revolving HELOCs that will commence amortization during the period of 2016–2017, approximately $0.6 billion, or 8%, of the loans have a CLTV greater than 100% as of December 31, 2015. Borrowers’ high loan-to-value positions, as well as the cost and availability of refinancing options, could limit borrowers’ ability to refinance their Revolving HELOCs as these loans begin to reset.

Approximately 6.7% of the Revolving HELOCs that have begun amortization as of December 31, 2015 were 30+ days past due, compared to 3.2% of the total outstanding home equity loan portfolio (amortizing and non-amortizing). This compared to 6.4% and 2.7%, respectively, as of December 31, 

2014. As newly amortizing loans continue to season, the delinquency rate of the amortizing Revolving HELOC portfolio and total home equity loan portfolio is expected to continue to increase. In addition, resets to date have generally occurred during a period of historically low interest rates, which Citi believes has likely reduced the overall “payment shock” to the borrower. 

Citi continues to monitor this reset risk closely and will continue to consider any potential impact in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves. In addition, management continues to review and take additional actions to offset potential reset risk, such as a borrower outreach program to provide reset risk education and proactively working with high-risk borrowers through a specialized single point of contact unit. For further information on reset risk, see “Risk Factors—Credit and Market Risks” above. 

Net Credit Losses and Delinquencies

The following charts detail the quarterly credit trends for Citi’s home equity loan portfolio in North America:

Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding.

72

North America Home Equity Loan Delinquencies - Citi Holdings

In billions of dollars

Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding.

As evidenced by the tables above, net credit losses in the North America home equity loan portfolio continued to improve during 2015, largely driven by the continued improvement in HPI. Delinquencies in the portfolio also improved during 2015, primarily due to liquidations and continued management actions, including the transfer of CitiFinancial home equity loans to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued modifications, partially offset by increased delinquencies associated with the increase in Revolving HELOCs commencing amortization. 

Given the limited market in which to sell delinquent home equity loans to date, as well as the relatively smaller number of home equity loan modifications and modification programs (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), Citi’s ability to reduce delinquencies or net credit losses in its home equity loan portfolio in Citi Holdings, whether pursuant to deterioration of the underlying credit performance of these loans, the reset of the Revolving HELOCs (as discussed above) or otherwise, is more limited as compared to residential first mortgages.

The following table sets forth Citi’s corporate credit portfolio within ICG (excluding private bank), before consideration of collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes drawn loans, overdrafts, bankers’ acceptances and leases. 

(2)Includes unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial guarantees.

Portfolio Mix—Geography, Counterparty and Industry

Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table shows the percentage by region based on Citi’s internal management geography:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived primarily through the use of validated statistical models, scorecard models and external agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of 

the obligor and factors that affect the loss-given-default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are 

considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.

Citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors, as necessary. Factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an 

obligor’s business and physical assets and, when relevant, consideration of cost-effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.

Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is also diversified by industry. The following table shows the allocation of Citi’s total corporate credit portfolio by industry:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. 

(1) In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the “Public sector” (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and “Transportation and industrial” sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities remained largely consistent with the prior quarter, at approximately $6 billion, of which approximately $4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans. 

Exposure to the Energy and Energy-Related Sector

As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s total corporate credit exposure to the energy and energy-related sector (see footnote 1 to the table above) was approximately $58 billion, with approximately $21 billion, or 3%, of Citi’s total outstanding loans consisting of direct outstanding funded loans. This compared to approximately $61 billion of total corporate credit exposure and $21 billion of direct outstanding funded loans as of September 30, 2015. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 72% of Citi’s total corporate credit energy and energy-related exposure was in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada (compared to approximately 73% at September 30, 2015). Also as of December 31, 2015, approximately 80% of Citi’s total energy and energy-related exposures were rated investment grade (compared to approximately 79% as of September 30, 2015). 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Citi built additional energy and energy-related loan loss reserves of approximately $250 million, and incurred approximately $75 million of net credit losses in these portfolios. For the full year 2015, Citi built net loan loss reserves against energy and energy-related exposures by approximately $530 

million, and incurred net credit losses of approximately $95 million. As of December 31, 2015, Citi held loan loss reserves against its funded energy and energy-related loans equal to approximately 3.8% of these loans. For additional information on energy and energy-related reserving actions in ICG, see “Institutional Clients Group” above.

Exposure to Banks, Broker-Dealers and Finance Companies

As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s total corporate credit exposure to banks, broker-dealers and finance companies was approximately $42 billion, of which $29 billion represented direct outstanding funded loans, or 5% of Citi’s total outstanding loans. These amounts were mostly unchanged when compared to $43 billion of total corporate credit exposure and $29 billion of direct outstanding funded loans to banks, broker-dealers and finance companies as of September 30, 2015. Also as of December 31, 2015, approximately 84% of Citi’s bank, broker-dealers and finance companies total corporate credit exposure was rated investment grade. 

Included in the amounts noted above, Citi’s total corporate credit exposure to banks was approximately $26 billion as of December 31, 2015 and was not concentrated in any particular geographic region. Of this exposure, more than 70% had a tenor of less than 12 months. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s direct outstanding funded loans to banks was $21 billion, or 3% of Citi’s total outstanding loans.

In addition to the corporate lending exposures described above, Citi has additional exposure to banks, broker-dealers and finance companies in the form of derivatives and securities financing transactions, which are typically executed as repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities loaned or borrowed arrangements. As of December 31, 2015, Citi had net derivative credit exposure to banks, broker dealers and finance companies of approximately $5 billion after the application of netting arrangements, legally enforceable margin agreements and other collateral arrangements. The collateral considered as part of the net derivative credit exposure was represented primarily by high quality, liquid assets. As of December 31, 2015, Citi had net credit exposure to banks, broker-dealers and finance companies in the form of securities financing transactions of $7 billion after the application of netting and collateral arrangements. The collateral considered in the net exposure for the securities financing transactions exposure was primarily cash and highly liquid investment grade securities.

78

Credit Risk Mitigation

As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Other revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $34.5 billion, $33.0 billion and $27.6 billion, respectively, of the corporate credit portfolio was economically hedged. Citigroup’s expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)2012 includes approximately $635 million of incremental charge-offs related to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) guidance issued in the third quarter of 2012, which required mortgage loans to borrowers that have gone through Chapter 7 U.S. Bankruptcy Code to be written down to collateral value. There was a corresponding approximate $600 million release in the third quarter of 2012 Allowance for loan losses related to these charge-offs. 2012 also includes a benefit to charge-offs of approximately $40 million related to finalizing the impact of the OCC guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012.

(2)2012 includes approximately $370 million of incremental charge-offs related to previously deferred principal balances on modified loans in the first quarter of 2012.

83

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans

There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary provides a general description of each category:

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:

•Corporate and consumer (commercial market) non-accrual status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal is doubtful.

•A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still be performing under the terms of the loan structure. Payments received on corporate non-accrual loans are generally applied to loan principal and not reflected as interest income. Approximately 45% and 40% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

•Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.

•Mortgage loans in regulated bank entities discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy, other than FHA insured loans, are classified as non-accrual. Non-bank mortgage loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy are classified as non-accrual at 90 days or more past due. In addition, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past due.

•North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services are not included because, under industry standards, credit card loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:

•Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).

•Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

84

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets

The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed 

will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2)Included within the increase in corporate non-accrual loans from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 is an approximate $340 million increase during the third quarter of 2015 primarily related to Citi’s North America energy and energy-related corporate credit exposure. For additional information, see “Corporate Credit Details” above.

These modifications were not considered TDRs because the modifications did not involve a concession (a required element of a TDR for accounting purposes).

(3)In addition to modifications reflected as TDRs at December 31, 2015, Citi also modified $22 million of commercial real estate loans risk rated “Substandard Non-Performing” or worse (asset category defined by banking regulators) in offices inside the U.S. These modifications were not considered TDRs because the modifications did not involve a concession (a required element of a TDR for accounting purposes).[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

LIQUIDITY RISK

OVERVIEW

Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes in Citi’s credit ratings and political and economic conditions in certain countries. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity objectives are aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base; (ii) growing its core businesses in Citicorp; (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances, including potential firm-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying durations and severity; and (iv) satisfying regulatory requirements. Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major categories:

•Citibank; and

•the non-bank and other, which includes the parent holding company (Citigroup), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries and other non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup, as well as Banamex and Citibank (Switzerland) AG.

At an aggregate level, Citigroup’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets (as discussed further below), even in times of stress. The liquidity risk management framework provides that certain entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary sources of funding include (i) deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, which are Citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding, (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated debt) primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.

As referenced above, Citigroup works to ensure that the structural tenor of these funding sources is sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base. The goal of Citi’s asset/liability management is to ensure that there is excess tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets. This reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before asset maturities or monetizations through sale, and in turn generates liquidity. This liquidity is held primarily in the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table below. 

Citi’s Treasurer has overall responsibility for management of Citi’s HQLA. Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by Corporate Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-country treasurers. Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA is managed with emphasis on asset-liability management and entity-level liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall risk profile of Citi’s HQLA. The Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s CFO co-chair Citi’s Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which includes Citi’s Treasurer and other senior executives. ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors its performance. Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by ALCO.

High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Amounts set forth in the table above are as of period end and may increase or decrease intra-period in the ordinary course of business. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized, and thus exclude any securities that are encumbered, as well as the haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions.

(1) “Non-Bank and Other” includes the parent holding company (Citigroup), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries and other non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup as well as Banamex and Citibank (Switzerland) AG. Banamex and Citibank (Switzerland) AG account for approximately $6 billion of the “Non-Bank and Other” HQLA balance as of December 31, 2015.

(2)Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises, and principally include government bonds from Hong Kong, India, 

Korea and Mexico. 

88

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s HQLA decreased both year-over-year as well as sequentially, driven primarily by reductions in long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as discussed further under “Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings” below.

Citi’s HQLA as set forth above does not include Citi’s available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) of which Citi is a member, which was approximately $36 billion as of December 31, 2015 (unchanged from September 30, 2015 and compared to $26 billion as of December 31, 2014) and maintained by eligible collateral pledged to such banks. The HQLA also does not include Citi’s borrowing capacity at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank discount window or other central banks, which would be in addition to the resources noted above.

In general, Citi’s liquidity is fungible across legal entities within its bank group. Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, can lend to the Citi parent and broker-dealer entities in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of December 31, 2015, the capacity available for lending to these entities under Section 23A was approximately $17 billion, largely unchanged from prior periods, subject to certain eligible non-cash collateral requirements. 

Loans

As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow its core businesses in Citicorp, including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients. The table below sets forth the end-of-period loans, by business and/or segment, and the total average loans for each of the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)For reporting purposes, includes EMEA GCB for all periods presented.

End-of-period loans declined 4% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s end-of-period loans decreased 1% both year-over-year and sequentially, in each case driven by continued overall declines in Citi Holdings.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citicorp loans increased 5% year-over-year. GCB loans grew 2% year-over-year, driven by 3% growth in North America. ICG loans increased 8% year-over-year. Within ICG, corporate loans increased 9% driven by both new business and the funding of prior commitments. Treasury and trade solutions loans declined 3%, as Citi continued to distribute a significant portion of its trade loan originations, which allows it to support its clients while maintaining balance sheet discipline in a continued low spread environment. Private bank, markets and securities services and other loans grew 14% year-over-year.

Citi Holdings loans decreased 43% year-over-year driven by over $21 billion of reductions in North America mortgages, including transfers to held-for-sale (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as the sale of OneMain Financial, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Deposits

Deposits are Citi’s primary and lowest cost funding source. The table below sets forth the end-of-period deposits, by business and/or segment, and the total average deposits for each of the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)For reporting purposes, includes EMEA GCB for all periods presented.

89

End-of-period deposits increased 1% year-over-year and remained relatively unchanged quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, despite significant reductions in Citi Holdings deposits from the prior-year period.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citicorp deposits grew 5% year-over-year. Within Citicorp, GCB deposits increased 2% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in international deposits. ICG deposits increased 9% year-over-year, with continued deposit growth in treasury and trade solutions and the private bank. 

The decline in Citi Holdings deposits from the prior-year period was primarily driven by the now-complete transfer of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MSSB) deposits to Morgan Stanley. 

Citi monitors its deposit base across multiple dimensions, including what Citi refers to as “LCR value” or the liquidity value of the deposit base under the U.S. LCR rules (as discussed under “Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)” below). Citi defines the liquidity value of deposits as the percentage of deposits assumed to remain following a 30-day period of liquidity stress. As discussed below, under the LCR rules, deposits are assigned liquidity values based on expected behavior under stress, determined by the type of deposit and the type of client. Generally, the LCR rules prioritize transactional and operating accounts of consumers (including retail and commercial banking deposits) and corporations respectively, while assigning lower liquidity values to non-operating deposit balances of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s total deposits had an aggregate liquidity value of approximately 73%, down slightly sequentially and unchanged from December 31, 2014. Within the 73% total liquidity value as of year-end 2015, Citi’s GCB deposits had a liquidity value of approximately 87% and ICG deposits, including Corporate/Other, had a liquidity value of approximately 66%. 

Long-Term Debt 

Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant component of Citi’s funding for the parent entities and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part to its multi-year contractual maturity structure. The weighted-average maturities of unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year (excluding remaining trust preferred securities outstanding) was approximately 6.9 years as of December 31, 2015, unchanged from the prior-year period and a slight increase sequentially, due in part to the issuance of longer-dated debt securities and the redemption of shorter-dated debt securities during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the parent includes senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-related debt is generally 

driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi’s parent entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank also includes FHLB advances and securitizations. 

Long-Term Debt Outstanding

The following table sets forth Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet which, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.

(1)Local country debt includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of their local operations.

(2)Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-branded credit card receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding decreased both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to significant buybacks of senior and subordinated debt at the parent level during the fourth quarter of 2015 (discussed below), as well as continued reductions in securitizations at the bank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs and assist it in meeting regulatory changes and requirements. During 2015, Citi repurchased an aggregate of approximately $21.1 billion of its outstanding long-term debt, including early redemptions of FHLB advances. Of this amount, approximately $11.5 billion was repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 as Citi completed significant asset sales in Citi Holdings, including the OneMain Financial business. Accordingly, while Citi anticipates continued liability management activities in 2016, it does not currently expect repurchases to remain at the level experienced in 2015.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)

In November 2015, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose minimum loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements on global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), including Citi, the intended purpose of which would be to facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. There are significant uncertainties and interpretive issues arising from the Federal Reserve Board’s proposal. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above. For an additional discussion of the method 1 and method 2 GSIB capital surcharge methodology as well as other regulatory capital aspects of the TLAC proposal, see “Capital Resources” above. 

Pursuant to the proposal, U.S. GSIBs would be required to issue and maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (LTD), each set by reference to the GSIB’s consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure. The proposed minimum external TLAC requirement would be the greater of (i) 18% of the GSIB’s RWA plus the applicable external TLAC buffer and (ii) 9.5% of its total leverage exposure. The applicable external TLAC buffer equals the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer, plus the GSIB’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the GSIB surcharge rule. Accordingly, Citi’s total estimated current TLAC requirement would be 22.5% of RWA under the proposal. Breach of the proposed external TLAC buffer would subject the GSIB to restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The proposed minimum external LTD requirement would be the greater of (i) 6% of the GSIB’s RWA plus its capital surcharge as determined under method 2 of the GSIB surcharge rule, for a total estimated current requirement of 9% of RWA for Citi and (ii) 4.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage exposure. 

As proposed, external TLAC would generally include (i) Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital issued directly by the bank holding company plus (ii) eligible external LTD. Eligible external LTD, which is a subcategory of external TLAC, would include unsecured, “plain vanilla” debt securities (i.e., would not include structured notes or securities containing derivative-linked features) issued directly by the bank holding company, governed by U.S. law and with a remaining maturity greater than one year. Further, pursuant to what has been referred to as the “haircut” provision, otherwise eligible external LTD with a remaining maturity of less than two years would be subject to a 50% haircut for purposes of meeting the minimum external LTD requirement. In addition, otherwise eligible external LTD which provides for acceleration of the payment of principal and interest other than upon the occurrence of insolvency or non-payment would not be eligible LTD.  

Designed to further enhance the resolvability of a U.S. GSIB, the proposal would also prohibit or limit certain financial arrangements at the bank holding company level, or what are referred to as “clean holding company” requirements. Pursuant to these requirements, the bank holding company 

would be prohibited from having certain types of third-party liabilities, including short-term debt, derivatives and other qualified financial contracts, liabilities guaranteed by a subsidiary (i.e., upstream guarantees) and guarantees of subsidiary liabilities or similar arrangements if the liability or guarantee includes a default right linked to the insolvency of the bank holding company (i.e., downstream guarantees with cross default provisions). In addition, the clean holding company requirements would limit the third-party, non-contingent liabilities of the bank holding company that are not related to TLAC or LTD and are pari passu with or junior to eligible external LTD, including structured notes and various operating liabilities, to 5% of the U.S. GSIB’s outstanding external TLAC.

The proposal would further require that U.S. GSIBs deduct from their regulatory capital any investment in unsecured debt issued by GSIBs in excess of certain thresholds. This deduction would be required regardless of the tenor of the instrument and regardless of whether the debt instrument would qualify as eligible external LTD.

While not included in its proposed requirements, the Federal Reserve Board also indicated in its notice of proposed rulemaking that it was considering imposing “domestic internal TLAC” requirements for the material operating subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs. The Board indicated any such requirements would be designed to, among other things, require the maintenance of “contributable resources” (in the form of high-quality liquid assets) at the bank holding company and/or “prepositioned resources” at the level of the material operating subsidiaries (in the form of debt and equity investments in the subsidiaries).

The proposed effective date for the requirements included in the proposal would be January 1, 2019, with the exception of the RWA component of the external TLAC requirement, which would be 16% as of January 1, 2019 and would increase to 18% on January 1, 2022. 

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings

As referenced above, Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings generally include (i) secured funding transactions (securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or repos) and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings). Citi has purposefully reduced its other short-term borrowings, including FHLB borrowings, as it continued to grow its high-quality deposits.

Secured Funding

Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both secured lending activity and a portion of securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities, which is typically collateralized by foreign government debt securities. Generally, daily changes 

92

in the level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $146 billion as of December 31, 2015 declined 16% from the prior-year period and 13% sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured funding decreased 11% from the prior-year period and 12% sequentially, both driven by normal business activity. Average balances for secured funding were approximately $163 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is secured by high quality, liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. The tenor of Citi’s matched book liabilities is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 

corresponding matched book assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral, and stipulating financing tenor. The weighted average maturity of Citi’s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of December 31, 2015.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. Additionally, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 

secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

The following table contains the year-end, average and maximum month-end amounts for the following respective short-term borrowings categories at the end of each of the three prior fiscal years:

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 

Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and political and economic conditions in certain countries. These conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons (overnight, one week, two weeks, one month, three months, one year) and over a variety of stressed conditions. Liquidity limits are set accordingly. To monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies, with several tests performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

In addition to internal measures that Citi has developed for a 30-day stress scenario, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR, as calculated pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules.

Generally, the LCR is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of HQLA to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing HQLA by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30-day period, with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities, such as deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings, unused lending commitments and derivatives-related exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days. Banks are required to calculate an add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day period in determining the total amount of net outflows. The minimum LCR requirement is 90% effective January 2016, increasing to 100% in January 2017.

The table below sets forth the components of Citi’s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows as of the 

periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s LCR was unchanged both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, as the reduction in Citi’s HQLA was offset by a reduction in net outflows, reflecting reductions in Citi’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

For 12-month liquidity stress periods, Citi uses several measures, including its internal long-term liquidity measure, based on a 12-month scenario assuming deterioration due to a combination of idiosyncratic and market stresses of moderate to high severity. It is broadly defined as the ratio of unencumbered liquidity resources to net stressed cumulative outflows over a 12-month period.

In addition, in October 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued final standards for the implementation of the Basel III NSFR, with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. Similar to Citi’s internal long-term liquidity measure, the NSFR is intended to measure the stability of a banking organization’s funding over a one-year time horizon. Pursuant to the Basel Committee’s final standards, the NSFR is calculated by dividing the level of a bank’s available stable funding by its required stable funding. The ratio is required to be greater than 100%. Under the Basel Committee standards, available stable funding primarily includes portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while required stable funding primarily includes the portion of long-term assets which are deemed illiquid. The U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed the U.S. version of the NSFR, although a proposal is expected during 2016. 

94

Credit Ratings

Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, its funding capacity, ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of these funds, and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below sets forth the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of December 31, 2015. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) were A/A-1 at Standard & Poor’s and A+/F1 at Fitch as of December 31, 2015. The long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were BBB+/A-2 at Standard & Poor’s and A/

F1 at Fitch as of December 31, 2015.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Recent Credit Rating Developments

On December 8, 2015, Fitch affirmed Citigroup Inc.’s Viability Rating (VR) and Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘a/A’, respectively. At the same time, Fitch affirmed Citibank’s VR and IDR at ‘a/A+’, respectively. The outlooks for the Long-Term IDRs are stable.

On December 2, 2015, as expected, S&P downgraded the holding company ratings of all eight U.S. GSIBs, including Citigroup Inc., by one notch, reflecting its view of the likelihood of extraordinary government support to be “uncertain.” As a result, Citigroup Inc.'s long-term rating now stands at BBB+ and the outlook was upgraded to "Stable." The short-term rating of Citigroup Inc. remained at A-2. The operating company ratings of the GSIBs, including Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., remained unchanged, with a “Watch Positive” outlook, as S&P waits for further clarity from the regulators regarding TLAC eligibility of certain instruments. S&P has stated it expects to conclude its credit watch within the first half of 2016.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades

Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivatives triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical, simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation methodologies, and judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-

evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers

As of December 31, 2015, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.6 billion, compared to $0.7 billion as of September 30, 2015. Other funding sources, such as securities financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2015, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity by approximately $1.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2015, due to derivative triggers.

95

In total, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank, across all three major rating agencies, could result in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $1.9 billion, compared to $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2015 (see also Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As set forth under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, the liquidity resources of Citibank were approximately $312 billion and the liquidity resources of Citi’s non-bank and other entities were approximately $66 billion, for a total of approximately $379 billion as of December 31, 2015. These liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending, and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings from certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional deposits, or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts

In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential one-notch downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating by S&P could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. As of December 31, 2015, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $10.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $9.4 billion as of September 30, 2015 (as referenced in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank and Banamex entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

OVERVIEW

Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities. 

Each business is required to establish, with approval from Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, Citi’s country and business Asset and Liability Committees and the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits.

Market risk emanates from both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. Trading portfolios comprise all assets and liabilities marked-to-market, with results reflected in earnings. Non-trading portfolios include all other assets and liabilities.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 

Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest revenues, the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies. 

Net Interest Revenue at Risk

Net interest revenue, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the difference between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on the liabilities (including customer deposits or company borrowings). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, as well as the amounts of assets and liabilities, and the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates. 

 Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. 

Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior, and the impact of pricing decisions. For example, in rising interest rate scenarios, portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates. In declining interest rate scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates. IRE assumes that businesses and/or Citi Treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes.

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, Citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, purchase fixed rate securities, issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 

implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent. 

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated company-wide position. Citi’s client-facing businesses create interest-rate sensitive positions, including loans and deposits, as part of their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally. Operating within established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools, such as Citi’s investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt, and interest rate derivatives, to target the desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading assets and liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting impacts, as well as Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.

Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities; and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on AOCI

Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in AOCI on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity.

97

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was $(211) million for a 100 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2015.

(2)Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(3)The estimated initial impact to the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio considers the effect of Citi’s deferred tax asset position and is based on only the estimated initial AOCI impact above. 

The sequential decrease in the estimated impact to net interest revenue primarily reflected Citi Treasury actions, offset by an increase in certain of Citi’s deposit balances and an increasing capital base. The sequential increase in the estimated impact to AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily reflected changes in the composition of Citi Treasury’s investment and interest rate derivatives portfolio.

In the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, Citi expects the negative impact to AOCI would be offset in shareholders’ equity 

through the combination of expected incremental net interest revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time. As of December 31, 2015, Citi expects that the negative $4.8 billion impact to AOCI in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 22 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under four different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and Citi’s other currencies. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Each scenario in the table above assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. 

(1)Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)The estimated initial impact to the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio considers the effect of Citi’s deferred tax asset position and is based on only the estimated AOCI impact above.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact to Citi’s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under scenario 2 as compared to scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediate term maturities.

98

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI and Capital

As of December 31, 2015, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.5 billion, or 0.8% of TCE, as a result of changes to Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, the Euro, the British pound sterling and the Chinese yuan.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign-currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further impact the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio are shown in the table below. For additional information in the changes in AOCI, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Revenue/Expense and Net Interest Margin

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: All interest expense amounts include FDIC deposit insurance assessments.

(1)Net interest revenue includes the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%) of $487 million, $498 million, and $521 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest earning assets. Citi’s NIM was 2.92% in the fourth quarter of 2015, a slight decrease from 2.94% in the third quarter of 2015, and improved to 2.93% for the full year 2015, compared to 2.90% in 2014. The improvement in Citi’s NIM for the full year 2015 was driven by trading NIM and the impact of lower cost of funds, primarily declines in the cost of long-term debt, partially offset by lower loan yields. Going into 2016, Citi’s NIM will reflect the sale of OneMain Financial, which will be partially offset by the benefit of debt repurchases during 2015, including in the fourth quarter of 2015. Accordingly, Citi currently expects a decrease in its NIM in the first half of 2016.

As noted in the tables above, Citi’s interest expense includes the impact of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. 

As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is required to ensure that its deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose on insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in assets (large banks), which includes Citibank, a surcharge of 4.5 basis points per annum until the fund reaches the required ratio, which the FDIC estimates would take approximately two years. Based on its current assessment base, Citi estimates the net impact to Citibank would be approximately $500 million over the two-year period. As part of its proposed rulemaking, the FDIC also discussed an alternative to the surcharge proposal which would impose a one-time assessment, similar to a shortfall assessment, on large banks in order to reach the 1.35% target. As discussed by the FDIC, this shortfall assessment would be approximately 12 basis points on the 

100

then-current assessment base in the quarter determined by the FDIC. If the FDIC were to adopt this approach, Citi estimates the net impact to Citibank would be approximately $900 million, based on its current assessment base. As an alternative to either of the proposals put forth by the FDIC, in commenting on the FDIC’s notice of proposed rulemaking, industry groups recommended that in lieu of any surcharge on 

large banks, the FDIC maintain the assessment rate framework in effect as of year-end 2015 until the reserve ratio reaches 1.35%, which would be expected to occur by year-end 2019 (and within the timeframe required under the Dodd-Frank Act). It is not certain when the FDIC’s proposal will be finalized and what the ultimate impact will be to Citi.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS

Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the CVA relating from derivatives counterparties and all associated hedges, fair value option loans, hedges to the loan portfolio and the leverage finance pipeline within capital markets origination within ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, including but not limited to:

•factor sensitivities; 

•value at risk (VAR); and 

•stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including trading mandates, 

permitted product lists and a new product approval process for complex products.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue (loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within particular ranges. Trading-related revenues includes trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties as well as any associated hedges to that CVA. In addition, it excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading inventory. As shown in the chart, positive trading-related revenue was achieved for 97% of the trading days in 2015.

105

Factor Sensitivities

Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury bill for a one basis point change in interest rates. Citi’s Market Risk Management, within the Risk organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated, monitored and, in most cases, limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk

VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition, differences in VAR methodologies, and differences in model parameters. As a result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and Validation” below), which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 

various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s VAR includes positions which are measured at fair value; it does not include investment securities classified as AFS or HTM. For information on these securities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three years) market volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves approximately 300,000 market factors, making use of approximately 180,000 time series, with sensitivities updated daily, volatility parameters updated daily to weekly and correlation parameters updated monthly. The conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 17% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average and year-end Trading VAR decreased from 2014 to 2015, mainly due to changes in interest rate and credit spread exposures in the markets and securities services businesses within ICG. Trading and Credit Portfolio VAR also declined, although the decrease from Trading VAR was partially offset by additional hedging related to lending activities in 2015.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each individual risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within each and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each individual risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2) The total Trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions from ICG and Citi Holdings, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans, and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 

(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination within ICG.

106

The table below provides the range of market factor VARs associated with Citi’s total trading VAR, inclusive of specific risk:

Note: No covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close of business dates.

The following table provides the VAR for ICG, excluding the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, hedges of CVA, fair value option loans and hedges to the loan portfolio:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

VAR Model Review and Validation

Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions, and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In addition, as part of the model validation process, product specific back-testing on portfolios is periodically completed and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR (as described below) back-testing is performed against buy-and-hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios across the organization (trading desk level, ICG business segment and Citigroup) and the results are shared with the U.S. banking regulators.

Significant VAR model and assumption changes must be independently validated within Citi’s risk management organization. This validation process includes a review by Citi’s model validation group and further approval from its model validation review committee, which is composed of senior quantitative risk management officers. In the event of significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., Total trading and Total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, as such, the model review and oversight process for both purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact 

that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under “Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes all trading book covered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. 

Regulatory VAR Back-testing

In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss, and changes in reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceeded the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.

107

The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there was one back-testing exception observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR for the prior 12 months. As previously disclosed, trading losses on January 15, 2015 exceeded the VAR estimate at the Citigroup level following the Swiss National Bank’s announcement removing the minimum exchange rate of Swiss franc per Euro.

The difference between the 38% of days with buy-and-hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 97% of days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily trading-related revenue above reflects, among other things, that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss (1)—12 Months ended December 31, 2015

In millions of dollars

(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, intra-day trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart below of Daily Trading-related revenue.

108

Stress Testing

Citi performs stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. Citi’s Market Risk management, after consultations with the businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises, and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down systemic stresses and bottom-up business specific stresses. Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. Business specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments, 

especially those risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.

The systemic stress scenarios and business specific stress scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk. In general, changes in market factors are defined over a one-year horizon. However, for the purpose of calculating internal risk capital, changes in a very limited number of the most liquid market factors are defined over a shorter three-month horizon. The limited set of market factors subject to the shorter three-month time horizon are those that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises, even as the trading liquidity of most other market factors materially decreased.

109

OPERATIONAL RISK 

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or human factors, or from external events. It includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which Citi is involved. Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well as the internal processes that support those business activities, and can result in losses arising from events related to the following, among others:

•fraud, theft and unauthorized activity;

•employment practices and workplace environment;

•clients, products and business practices;

•physical assets and infrastructure; and

•execution, delivery and process management.

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of Citi’s businesses, the markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity, and the competitive, economic and regulatory environment.

To anticipate, mitigate and control operational risk, Citi maintains a system of policies and has established a consistent framework for monitoring, assessing and communicating operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment across Citigroup. As part of this framework, Citi has established a manager’s control assessment process (as described under “Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risk—Compliance Risk” below) to help managers self-assess significant operational risks and key controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design and/or operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate significant operational risks.

Each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework. The process for operational risk management includes the following steps:

•identify and assess key operational risks;

•design controls to mitigate identified risks;

•establish key risk indicators;

•implement a process for early problem recognition and timely escalation;

•produce comprehensive operational risk reporting; and

•ensure that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks.

As new products and business activities are developed, processes are designed, modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered.

An Operational Risk Management Committee has been established to provide oversight for operational risk across Citigroup and to provide a forum to assess Citi’s operational risk profile and ensure actions are taken so that Citi’s operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent with Citi’s risk appetite. The Committee seeks to ensure that these actions address the root causes that persistently lead to 

operational risk losses and create lasting solutions to minimize these losses. Members include Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s Head of Operational Risk and senior members of their organizations. These members cover multiple dimensions of risk management and include business and regional Chief Risk Officers and senior operational risk managers.

In addition, Risk management, including Operational Risk Management, works proactively with the businesses and other independent control functions to embed a strong operational risk management culture and framework across Citi. Operational Risk Management engages with the businesses and the respective Chief Risk Officers to ensure effective implementation of the Operational Risk Management framework by focusing on (i) identification, analysis and assessment of operational risks; (ii) effective challenge of key control issues and operational risks; and (iii) anticipation and mitigation of operational risk events.

Information about the businesses’ operational risk, historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area. The information is summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to the Audit Committee of Citi’s Board of Directors.

Operational risk is measured and assessed through risk capital. Projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are also required as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.

COUNTRY RISK

Emerging Markets Exposures 

Citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in Latin America, Asia (other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand), Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The following table presents Citicorp’s principal emerging markets assets as of December 31, 2015. For 

purposes of the table below, loan amounts are generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 

Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized below based on the domicile of the issuer of the security or the underlying reference entity (for additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below).

Emerging Markets Trading Account Assets and Investment Securities

In the ordinary course of business, Citi holds securities in its trading accounts and investment accounts, including those above. Trading account assets are marked to market daily, with asset levels varying as Citi maintains inventory consistent with customer needs. Investment securities are recorded at either fair value or historical cost, based on the underlying accounting treatment, and are predominantly held as part of the local entity asset and liability management program or to comply with local regulatory requirements. In the markets in the table above, approximately 99% of Citi’s investment securities were related to sovereign issuers as of December 31, 2015.

Emerging Markets Consumer Lending

GCB’s strategy within the emerging markets is consistent with GCB’s overall strategy, which is to leverage its global footprint to serve its target clients. The retail bank seeks to be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies. Commercial banking generally serves small- and middle-market enterprises operating in GCB’s geographic markets, focused on clients that value Citi’s global capabilities. Overall, Citi believes that its customers are more resilient than the overall market under a wide range of economic conditions. Citi’s consumer business has a well-established risk appetite framework across geographies and products that reflects the business strategy and activities and establishes boundaries around the key risks that arise from the strategy and activities.

As of December 31, 2015, GCB had approximately $110 billion of consumer loans outstanding to borrowers in the emerging markets, or approximately 38% of GCB’s total loans, largely unchanged from September 30, 2015 and compared to $118 billion (41%) as of December 31, 2014. Of the approximate $110 billion as of December 31, 2015, the five largest emerging markets—Mexico, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan—comprised approximately 27% of GCB’s total loans. Within the emerging markets, 30% of Citi’s GCB loans were mortgages, 26% were commercial markets loans, 24% were personal loans and 20% were credit card loans, each as of December 31, 2015. 

Overall consumer credit quality remained generally stable in the fourth quarter of 2015, as net credit losses in the emerging markets were 1.9% of average loans, compared to 1.8% and 2.2% in the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, consistent with Citi’s target market strategy and risk appetite framework. The increase in net credit losses in certain emerging market countries in Asia, such as Hong Kong and Indonesia, primarily related to Citi’s commercial banking business in such countries and was primarily due to the impact of lower commodity prices as well as the slowdown in growth in the region. The increase in net credit losses in Brazil also related to the commercial banking business and largely related to a wind-down portfolio in Brazil, where the losses were mostly offset by the release of previously-established loan loss reserves.

Emerging Markets Corporate Lending

Consistent with ICG’s overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients in the emerging markets are typically large, multinational corporations that value Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with these clients that encompass multiple products, consistent with client needs, including cash management and trade services, foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory. Citi believes that its target corporate segment is more resilient under a wide range of economic conditions, and that its relationship-based approach to client service enables it to effectively manage the risks inherent in such relationships. Citi has a well-established risk appetite framework around its corporate lending activities, including risk-based limits and approval authorities and portfolio concentration boundaries.

As of December 31, 2015, corporate loans (excluding the private bank) were approximately $93 billion in the emerging markets, representing approximately 43% of total corporate loans outstanding, compared to $97 billion (43%) and $99 billion (47%) as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. No single emerging markets country accounted for more than 6% of Citi’s corporate loans as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 75% of Citi’s emerging markets corporate credit portfolio (excluding the private bank), including loans and unfunded lending commitments, was rated investment grade, which Citi considers to be ratings of BBB or better according to its internal risk measurement system and methodology (for additional information on Citi’s internal risk measurement system for corporate credit, see “Corporate Credit” above). The majority of the remainder was rated BB or B according to Citi’s internal risk measurement system and methodology. 

The private bank, which is part of ICG and primarily serves high-net-worth individuals, had approximately $17 billion of loans in the emerging markets as of December 31, 2015, representing approximately 25% of the business’s total loans outstanding, unchanged from September 30, 2015 and compared to $17 billion (27%) as of December 31, 2014. Private bank loans are typically secured by liquid collateral or real estate and, consistent with the rest of the ICG loan portfolio, the business has a well-established risk appetite framework around its lending activities, including risk-based limits and approval authorities and portfolio concentration boundaries.

Overall ICG net credit losses in the emerging markets were 0.1% of average loans in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 0.0% and 0.4% in the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The ratio of non-accrual ICG loans to total loans in the emerging markets remained stable at 0.4% as of December 31, 2015.

112

Argentina 

As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $747 million, compared to $917 million at September 30, 2015 and $780 million at December 31, 2014. 

Citi uses the Argentine peso as the functional currency in Argentina and translates its financial statements into U.S. dollars using the official exchange rate as published by the Central Bank of Argentina. Over the last several years, the Argentine government has imposed strict foreign exchange controls which have limited Citi’s ability to access U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, repatriate capital and hedge its currency risk, among other impacts. In the latter part of 2015, however, Argentina elected a new president and the Argentine government took steps to loosen some of these foreign exchange controls. While these actions were encouraging, they did result in a devaluation of the Argentine peso to 13 pesos per one U.S. dollar at December 31, 2015, compared to 9.4 pesos per one U.S. dollar at September 30, 2015 and 8.6 pesos per one U.S. dollar at December 31, 2014. 

The impact of devaluations of the Argentine peso on Citi’s net investment in Argentina is reported as a translation loss in stockholders’ equity offset, to the extent hedged, by:

•gains or losses recorded in stockholders’ equity on net investment hedges that have been designated as, and qualify for, hedge accounting under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging; and

•gains or losses recorded in earnings for its U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets or currency futures held in Argentina that do not qualify as net investment hedges under ASC 815.

At December 31, 2015, Citi had cumulative translation losses related to its investment in Argentina, net of qualifying net investment hedges, of approximately $1.88 billion (pretax), which were recorded in stockholders’ equity. This compared to $1.66 billion (pretax) as of September 30, 2015 and $1.51 billion (pretax) as of December 31, 2014. The cumulative translation losses would not be reclassified into earnings unless realized upon sale or liquidation of substantially all of Citi’s Argentine operations. 

As noted above, Citi hedges currency risk in its net investment in Argentina to the extent possible and prudent. As of December 31, 2015, Citi’s total hedges against its net investment in Argentina were approximately $821 million (compared to $972 million as of September 30, 2015 and $810 million as of December 31, 2014). Of this amount, approximately $567 million consisted of foreign currency forwards that were recorded as net investment hedges under ASC 815 (compared to approximately $562 million as of September 30, 2015 and $420 million as of December 31, 2014). The remaining hedges of approximately $254 million as of December 31, 2015 (compared to $410 million as of September 30, 2015 and $390 million as of December 31, 2014) were net U.S. dollar-denominated assets and foreign currency futures in Citi Argentina that do not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815. 

Although Citi currently uses the Argentine peso as the functional currency for its operations in Argentina, an increase in inflation resulting in a cumulative three-year inflation rate of 100% or more would result in a change in the functional currency to the U.S. dollar. Citi bases its evaluation of the cumulative three-year inflation rate on the official inflation statistics published by INDEC, the Argentine government’s statistics agency. The cumulative three-year inflation rate as of November 30, 2015, based on statistics published by INDEC, was approximately 57% (compared to 52% as of December 31, 2014). While a change in the functional currency to the U.S. dollar would not result in any immediate gains or losses to Citi, it would result in future devaluations of the Argentine peso being recorded in earnings for Citi’s Argentine peso-denominated assets and liabilities.

As of December 31, 2015, Citi had total third-party assets of approximately $4.4 billion in Citi Argentina (unchanged from September 30, 2015 and compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2014), primarily composed of corporate and consumer loans and cash on deposit with and short-term paper issued by the Central Bank of Argentina. A significant portion of these assets was funded with local deposits. Included in the total assets were U.S. dollar-denominated assets of approximately $918 million, compared to approximately $562 million at September 30, 2015 and $550 million at December 31, 2014. The sequential increase in U.S. dollar-denominated assets was largely due to the Argentine government’s loosening of foreign exchange controls toward the end of 2015, as referenced above. (For additional information on Citi’s exposures related to Argentina, see “Emerging Markets Exposures” above.)

In addition to these foreign exchange and other economic risks, as widely reported, Argentina continues to be engaged in litigation in the U.S. with certain “holdout” bond investors who did not accept restructured bonds in the restructuring of Argentine debt after Argentina defaulted on its sovereign obligations in 2001. Based on U.S. court rulings to date, Argentina has been ordered to negotiate a settlement with “holdout” bond investors and, absent a negotiated settlement, not pay interest on certain of its restructured bonds unless it simultaneously pays all amounts owed to the “holdout” investors that are the subject of the litigation. Although Argentina has been in technical default of the U.S. court’s ruling since mid-2014, Argentina’s new president has announced that it will be a priority for his administration to attempt to settle the dispute, and in February 2016, Argentina restarted negotiations with its creditors, including the “holdout” investors. 

Citi Argentina acted as a custodian in Argentina for certain of the restructured bonds that are part of the “holdout” bond litigation; specifically, U.S.-dollar-denominated restructured bonds governed by Argentine law and payable in Argentina. In 2015, the U.S. court overseeing the Argentina litigation ruled that Citi Argentina’s processing of interest payments on these bonds, as custodian, was prohibited by the court’s order. As a result, Citi

announced its intention to exit its custody business in

113

Argentina, which such exit is not expected to have a material impact on Citi Argentina’s results of operations. Upon such announcement, the prior Argentine government took a number of adverse actions against Citi Argentina, including filing a lawsuit against Citi Argentina and suspending certain of its activities. While the new government has, to date, indicated a willingness to settle these matters, it remains uncertain as to when these matters will be resolved and what impact, if any, such resolution will have on Citi or its franchise in Argentina. 

Venezuela

The Venezuelan government operates restrictive foreign exchange controls. These exchange controls have limited Citi’s ability to obtain U.S. dollars in Venezuela; Citi has not been able to acquire U.S. dollars from the Venezuelan government since 2008, other than for its customers’ needs.

As of December 31, 2015, the Venezuelan government operated three separate official foreign exchange rates: \

•the preferential foreign exchange rate offered by the National Center for Foreign Trade (CENCOEX), fixed at 6.3 bolivars to one U.S. dollar; 

•the SICAD rate, which was 13.5 bolivars to one U.S. dollar; and 

•the SIMADI rate, which was 199 bolivars to one U.S. dollar. 

Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in Venezuela. As of December 31, 2015, Citi uses the SICAD rate to remeasure its net bolivar-denominated monetary assets as the SICAD rate is the only rate at which Citi is legally eligible to acquire U.S. dollars from CENCOEX, despite the limited availability of U.S. dollars and although the SICAD rate may not necessarily be reflective of economic reality. Re-measurement of Citi’s bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities due to changes in the exchange rate is recorded in earnings. Citi has been unable to hedge the currency risk in its net investment in Venezuela due to the lack of effective market hedging mechanisms. 

At December 31, 2015, Citi’s net investment in its Venezuelan operations was approximately $200 million (compared to $187 million at September 30, 2015 and $180 million at December 31, 2014), which included net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan bolivars of approximately $177 million (compared to approximately $160 million at September 30, 2015 and $140 million at December 31, 2014). Total third-party assets of Citi Venezuela were approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015 (unchanged from September 30, 2015 and compared to $0.9 billion at December 31, 2014), primarily composed of cash on deposit with the Central Bank of Venezuela, corporate and consumer loans, and government bonds. A significant portion of these assets was funded with local deposits.

On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its foreign exchange controls. Based on the announcement, the CENCOEX rate would increase to 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar, the SICAD rate would no longer 

exist and the SIMADI rate is expected to become a free floating rate of at least 202 bolivars per U.S. dollar at inception. 

Based on this announcement, Citi expects to begin using the SIMADI rate in the first quarter of 2016 to remeasure its net bolivar-denominated monetary assets, despite the possibly limited availability of U.S. dollars (notwithstanding the fact that it has been described as a free floating rate) and although the new SIMADI rate may not necessarily be reflective of economic reality. At the expected minimum new SIMADI rate of 202 bolivars per U.S. dollar, Citi estimates that it will incur an approximate $172 million foreign currency loss in the first quarter of 2016, which could increase if the bolivar continues to devalue in the new SIMADI market. Additionally, Citi expects its revenues and expenses will be translated at the SIMADI rate beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Because the new foreign exchange control rules have not yet been officially published and are thus not yet effective, however, the impact to Citi’s results of operations as a result of the February 17th announcement is not yet certain. 

Russia

During 2015, political events led to the imposition of international sanctions against Russia (as well as Russian entities, business sectors, individuals or otherwise). These ongoing sanctions, coupled with lower oil and other commodity prices, particularly during the second half of 2015, have had a significant impact on Russia’s economy, and could continue to do so. During 2015, the Russian ruble depreciated by 22% against the U.S. dollar.

Citibank operates in Russia through a subsidiary, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency. Citibank’s net investment in Russia was approximately $0.8 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $0.9 billion at September 30, 2015 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, substantially all of Citibank’s net investment was hedged (subject to related tax adjustments) using forward foreign exchange contracts. Total third-party assets of the Russian Citibank subsidiary were approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, unchanged from September 30, 2015 and compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2014. These assets were primarily composed of corporate and consumer loans, Russian government debt securities, and cash on deposit with the Central Bank of Russia. The large majority of these assets were funded by local deposits. (For additional information on Citi’s exposures related to Russia, see “Emerging Markets Exposures” above.)

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local Country Assets

Citi’s cross-border disclosures are based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), as revised in December 2013. The following summarizes some of the FFIEC key reporting guidelines:

•Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor, counterparty, collateral, issuer or guarantor, as applicable. 

•Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for securities financing transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional amounts. 

•Netting of derivatives receivables and payables, reported at fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges.

•The netting of long and short positions for AFS securities and trading portfolios is not permitted. 

•Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 

•Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in some cases, significantly, from period to period. As an example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings, all else being equal.

115

The tables below set forth each country whose total outstandings exceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:

COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT AND LEGAL RISK

COMPLIANCE RISK

Compliance Risk Appetite Framework 

Citi’s compliance risk appetite framework outlines Citi’s compliance risk appetite, how Citi manages its adherence to its compliance risk appetite and how Citi evaluates the effectiveness of its controls for managing compliance risks. This framework is comprised of three pillars:

•Setting risk appetite: Citi establishes its compliance risk appetite by setting limits on the types of business in which Citi will engage, the products and services Citi will offer, the types of customers which Citi will service, the counterparties with which Citi will deal, and the locations where Citi will do business. These limits are guided by Citi’s mission and value proposition and the principle of responsible finance, Citi’s adherence to relevant standards of conduct, as well as to relevant and applicable laws, rules, regulations, and Citi’s internal policies.

•Adhering to risk appetite: Citi manages adherence to its compliance risk appetite through the execution of its compliance program, which includes governance arrangements, a policy framework, customer onboarding and maintenance processes, product development processes, transaction and communication surveillance processes, conduct- and culture-related programs, monitoring regulatory changes, and new products, services, and complex transactions approval processes. At Citi, it is the responsibility of each employee to escalate breaches of the compliance risk appetite in a timely manner.

•Evaluating the effectiveness of risk appetite controls: Each business and Compliance evaluate the effectiveness of controls for managing compliance risk through the manager’s control assessment (MCA) process—a process through which managers at Citi identify, monitor, measure, report on, and manage risks. Citi also relies on compliance risk assessments; a policy framework; compliance testing and monitoring processes; compliance metrics related to key operating risks, key risk indicators, and control-effectiveness indicators; and Internal Audit examinations and reports.

Compliance Program

Compliance aims to operate Citi’s compliance risk appetite— and thus minimize, mitigate or manage compliance risks— through Citi’s compliance program. To achieve this mission, Compliance seeks to:

•Understand the regulatory environment, requirements and expectations to which Citi’s activities are subject. Compliance coordinates with Legal and other independent control functions, as appropriate, to identify, communicate and document key regulatory requirements.

•Assess the compliance risks of business activities and the state of mitigating controls, including the risks and controls in legal entities in which activity is conducted. To 

facilitate the identification and assessment of compliance risk, Compliance works with the businesses and other independent control functions to review significant compliance and regulatory issues and the results of testing, monitoring, and internal and external exams and audits.

•Define Citi’s appetite, in conjunction with Citigoup’s Board of Directors and senior management, for prudent compliance and regulatory risk consistent with its culture of compliance, control and responsible finance. As noted above, Citi has developed a compliance risk appetite framework that is designed to minimize, mitigate or manage compliance risk.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Detect, report on, escalate and remediate key compliance and franchise risks and control issues; test controls for design and operating effectiveness, promptly address issues, and track remediation efforts. Compliance designs and implements policies, standards, procedures, guidelines, surveillance reports and other solutions for use by the business and Compliance to promptly detect, address and remediate issues, test controls for design and operating effectiveness, and track remediation efforts.

•Engage with the Citigroup Board, business management, operating committees and Citi’s regulators to foster effective global governance. Compliance provides regular reports on emerging risks and other issues and their implications for Citi, as well as the performance of the compliance program, to the Citigroup Board of Directors, including the Audit and Ethics and Culture Committees, as well as other committees of the Board. Compliance also engages with business management on an ongoing basis through various mechanisms, including governance committees, and supports and advises the businesses and other global functions in managing regulatory relationships.

•Advise and train Citi personnel across businesses, functions, regions and legal entities in how to comply with laws, regulations and other relevant standards of conduct. Compliance helps promote a strong culture of compliance and control by increasing awareness and capability across Citi on key compliance issues through training and communication programs. A fundamental element of Citi’s culture is the requirement that Citi conduct itself in accordance with the highest standards of ethical behavior. 

118

Compliance plays a key role in developing company-wide initiatives designed to further embed ethics in Citi’s culture, such as an interactive course on ethics and leadership for employees, which included training on using an ethical decision-making framework to challenge decisions by Citi’s businesses. 

•Enhance the compliance program. Compliance fulfills its obligation to enhance the compliance program in part by using results from its annual compliance risk assessment to shape annual and multi-year program enhancements.

Volcker Compliance Program

The Volcker rule required Citi to develop and provide for an enhanced compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the rule’s prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and covered fund activities and investments. Citi’s Volcker rule office, which reports to business management, has responsibility for overall coordination and monitoring under its compliance program, including project management and process support, and providing assistance in coordinating engagement with and among Citi’s second line of defense. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks” and “—Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risks” above. 

CONDUCT RISK

Citi manages its exposure to conduct risk through the three lines of defense, as discussed above. Each employee in each line of defense is guided by Citi’s mission and value proposition and the principle of responsible finance. Citi’s leadership standards, which are aligned with Citi’s mission and value proposition, outline Citi’s expectations of employees’ behavior, and employees’ performance is evaluated against those standards. Citi’s businesses and functions are responsible for managing their conduct risks. Compliance advises Citi’s businesses and other functions on conduct risks and associated controls. Internal Audit, among other things, assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of Citi’s management of and controls for conduct risk.

In 2015, Citi issued a conduct risk policy to further the objectives of its Compliance-led conduct risk program, which was established in 2014 to enhance Citi’s culture of compliance and control through the management, minimization, and mitigation of Citi’s exposure to conduct risk. Citi uses the MCA process to assess the design and operation of controls that are utilized to manage the institution’s conduct risks. Citi also manages its conduct risk through other initiatives, including various culture-related efforts.

LEGAL RISK

Citi views legal risk as qualitative in nature because it cannot be reliably estimated or measured based on forecasts rather than actual results using statistical methods and does not lend itself to an appetite expressed through a numerical limit. As such, Citi seeks to manage this risk in accordance with its qualitative risk appetite principle, which generally state that activities in which Citi engages and the risks those activities generate must be consistent with Citi’s underlying 

commitment to the principle of responsible finance and managed with a goal to eliminate, minimize or mitigate this risk, as practicable. To accomplish this goal, legal risk is managed in accordance with the overall framework described in greater detail in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. 

REPUTATIONAL RISK

Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders, and Citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values, including the importance of protecting Citi’s reputation, to its employees, customers and investors. The responsibility for maintaining Citi’s reputation is shared by all employees, who are guided by Citi’s Code of Conduct. Employees are required to exercise sound judgment and common sense in every action they take and issues that present potential franchise, reputational and/or systemic risks are to be appropriately escalated. The business practices committees for each of Citi’s businesses and regions are part of the governance infrastructure Citi has in place to properly review business activities, sales practices, product design, perceived conflicts of interest and other potential franchise or reputational risks that arise in these businesses and regions. These committees may also raise potential franchise, reputational or systemic risks for due consideration by the business practices committee at the corporate level. All of these committees, which are composed of Citi’s most senior executives, provide the guidance necessary for Citi’s business practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and ethical behavior consistent with Citi’s mission and value proposition.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of Citigroup’s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi’s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates, and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

Valuations of Financial Instruments

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. Substantially all of 

these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on Citi’s 

Consolidated Balance Sheet.
