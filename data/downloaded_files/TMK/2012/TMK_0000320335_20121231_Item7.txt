Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Torchmarks Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Acquisition: On November 1, 2012, we acquired Family Heritage, a previously privately-held supplemental health insurance carrier. Information about this acquisition can be found in Note 6Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of Family Heritage subsequent to our acquisition are included in this discussion within our health insurance segment.  

Discontinued Operations: As described in Note 3Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold our subsidiary United Investors Life Insurance Company (United Investors) as of December 31, 2010. Because of the sale, United Investors financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations were discontinued.  

How Torchmark Views Its Operations: Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.  

Insurance Product Line Segments. As fully described in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and the administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:  

Premium revenue  

Less:  

 Policy obligations  

 Policy acquisition costs and commissions  

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:  

Net investment income  

Less:  

 Required interest on net policy liabilities  

 Financing costs  

The tables in Note 14Business Segments reconcile Torchmarks revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ending December 31, 2012. Additionally, this Note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and which reconciles to net income. That summary is reproduced below from the Consolidated Financial Statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business.

 * See the discussion of Realized Gains and Losses in this report.  

Torchmarks operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.  

Summary of Operations: Net income rose 6% to $529 million in 2012 from $497 million in 2011. It had declined slightly in 2011 from $499 million in 2010. On a diluted per share basis, 2012 net income rose 19% to $5.41 after a 12% increase in 2011 to $4.53 from net income of $4.05 in 2010. The per-share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. Results in 2010 include a $35 million after-tax loss on the disposal of United Investors, representing $.28 per diluted share. Also, each years per share net income was affected by realized investment gains, which were $0.25, $0.15, and $0.20 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. More information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion. Also, as explained in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, we do not consider non-operating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments to be part of our segment operating income.  

As shown in the above chart, after-tax segment results of operations, before discontinued operations, rose each year over the prior year from $480 million in 2010 to $494 million in 2011 to $507 million in 2012. The primary contributor to the growth in both 2011 and 2012 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment, in which margins rose $31 million in 2011 and $49 million in 2012. The life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented. Also contributing to growth in 2012 income was our health insurance segment, which provided $8 million of additional margin after a decline of $10 million in 2011. The 2012 improvement was largely due to the increased volume in our Medicare Part D program while the 2011 decline was a result of the discontinuance of sales of certain limited-benefit health products in late 2010 due to healthcare reform. Both 2012 and 2011 have been impacted negatively by declines in excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment. These declines in excess investment income have resulted from the continuing low interest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads on policy benefit requirements, discussed more fully under the caption Investments in this report.

Index to Financial Statements 

 In 2012, this pressure on excess investment income was increased as an unusual number of calls, resulting from a new regulation affecting bank hybrid securities, caused us to replace these higher yielding securities with securities at lower yields due to the current low-interest-rate environment. Also in 2012, there was a $7 million increase in stock compensation expense which negatively affected the results during the year. The increase in stock compensation expense resulted primarily from the increase in the value of Torchmarks stock and not from an increase in the number of grants.  

Total revenues rose 6% in 2012 to $3.59 billion. They were flat in 2011 at $3.38 billion compared with $3.37 billion in 2010. Life premium rose 5% or $82 million in 2012 to $1.81 billion. Life premium increased $63 million in 2011 to $1.73 billion. Net investment income was essentially flat at $694 million in 2012, after rising 2% or $17 million in 2011. Health premium increased 13% to $1.05 billion in 2012 and contributed $117 million to 2012 revenue growth, but health premium negatively affected revenue growth in 2011 as discussed below.  

While life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending December 31, 2012, margins as a percentage of premium have risen even more, rising in 2012 to 28% from 27% in 2011 and 26% in 2010. Segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth, but also by improvements in persistency in both periods. Life net sales increased 6% in 2012 to $343 million, but declined 1% in 2011 to $325 million. Life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption Life Insurance.  

We primarily market Medicare Supplement insurance, Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance, limited-benefit cancer, and accident health products. Prior to September, 2010, we marketed an under-age-65 limited-benefit hospital-surgical product. Health premium increased $117 million or 13% in 2012, as a result of the addition of a large number of new low-income Medicare Part D auto-enrollees in the 2012 plan year. However, 2011 health premium declined 6% to $930 million as a result of the discontinuance of certain limited-benefit health products because of healthcare reform mentioned above. Medicare Supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium, and we have experienced growth in net sales in this product in each successive year. Medicare Supplement premium was $432 million in 2012 but has declined slightly in each successive year as lapses have exceeded new sales. Our Medicare Part D premium rose 62% to $318 in 2012 as a result of the previously-noted addition of low-income auto-enrollees in the 2012 plan. Due to increased competition for the 2013 plan year, we expect a slight decrease in 2013 Part D premium. See the discussion under Health Insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.  

We offer fixed annuities, but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products, favoring life insurance instead. With the sale of United Investors in 2010, we disposed of 37% of our annuity deposit balance. See the caption Annuities for further discussion of the Annuity segment.  

As previously mentioned, the investment segments pretax profitability, or excess investment income, declined in both 2012 and 2011. Profitability in this segment is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In recent years, growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio. One reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Also, there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, during which the funds are held in cash. Growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by Torchmarks share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. In 2012, net investment income rose 1% while the portfolio (at amortized cost) grew 4%, as new money yields available have continued to decline.  

The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. The lower new-money yields resulting from the low-interest-rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow. We have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect, including lowering the discount rate on new business and increasing premium rates on  

20

 sales of new products as discussed under the caption Investments. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. Financing costs in 2012 increased 3% to $80 million, primarily as a result of two new debt offerings issued in the latter half of 2012 as described below. Financing costs also increased from $75 million in 2010 to $78 million in 2011, primarily a result of increased charges related to our letters of credit facility.  

Torchmarks current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment-grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 96% of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96% were investment grade at December 31, 2012. The average quality rating of the portfolio was A-. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption Investments in this report and Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment.  

As noted earlier, we issued two new debt offerings during 2012: our $300 million principal amount 3.8% Senior Notes due 2022 and our $125 million principal amount 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2052, both issued in September. Proceeds from the Senior Notes were $297 million, but $150 million were purchased by our insurance subsidiaries and were eliminated in consolidation. Proceeds from this offering provided funding for the retirement of our 7 3/8% Senior Notes due in August, 2013 and for the acquisition of Family Heritage in November, 2012. The $121 million net proceeds from the Subordinated Debentures were used to fund the call of our $120 million principal amount 7.1% Trust Originated Preferred Securities in October, 2012. More information on these transactions can be found in Note 6Acquisition and Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in our discussion of Capital Resources in this report.  

In 2011, income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. As reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Settlements, we were involved in certain issues in which we incurred settlement losses and expenses. We settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of $6.9 million ($4.5 million after tax) and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation amount which settled in early 2012 in the pretax amount of $12.0 million ($7.8 million after tax). Both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago. Additionally, in connection with the 2012 purchase of Family Heritage as described in Note 6Acquisition, we incurred $2.9 million of acquisition-related expenses ($1.9 million after tax). The state administrative settlement, the litigation accrual, and the acquisition expenses are included in Other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, as described in Note 1, we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.  

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Companys excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. Due to poor economic conditions, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009. However, in the first quarter of 2010, the Board of Directors reactivated the Companys share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2012.

Option proceeds increased significantly in 2011 and 2012 due to optionholders exercising several years of option grants that expired in 2012.  

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.  

A discussion of each of Torchmarks segments follows. The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in Note 14Business Segments.  

Life Insurance. Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2012 life premium representing 63% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72% of the total in 2012. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.  

Life insurance premium rose 5% to $1.81 billion in 2012 after having increased 4% in 2011 to $1.73 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:  

LIFE INSURANCE  

Premium by Distribution Method  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: annualized premium in force, net sales, and first-year collected premium. Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.

Annualized life premium in force was $1.90 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of 4% over $1.81 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.75 billion at December 31, 2010.

The American Income Exclusive Agency has historically focused primarily on marketing to members of labor unions. While the labor union market is still the backbone of American Incomes business, the agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help to ensure sustainable growth. It is Torchmarks highest margin business. The American Income Agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any Torchmark distribution method in 2012. Life premium for this agency rose 9% to $664 million, after having risen 8% in 2011. Net sales increased 12% in 2012 after having risen 3% in 2011. Net sales rose 8% in 2010. The average face amount of policies issued in 2012 was approximately $33 thousand. As is the case with all of Torchmarks agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. The American Income agent count was 5,176 at December 31, 2012 compared with 4,381 a year earlier, an increase of 18%. The agent count increased 12% in 2011. Managements primary objective is to grow middle management in the agency to help ensure sustainable growth. This is being achieved through an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel. In 2011, we began providing more home-office and webinar training programs. These programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level managers, coaching and instruction specifically designed for his or her level of experience and responsibilities.  

The Direct Response Unit reaches the market through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings, insert media, internet, and inbound telephone calls. These different approaches support and complement one another in our efforts to reach the consumer. Direct

 response focuses primarily on young middle-income households with children. The juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this unit. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, it is also a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. At this time, we believe that the Direct Response unit is the largest U.S. writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance. We expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of Direct Responses premier markets. Historically, the Direct Response units growth has been fueled by constant innovation. In recent years, the internet and inbound call center production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased internet marketing activities and focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center.  

The Direct Response operation accounted for 35% of our life insurance premium during 2012, increasing 6% over 2011 premium. Life premium for this unit rose 5% in 2011 and 6% in 2010. Net sales rose 3% to $141 million in 2012 after being flat in 2011. First-year collected premium rose 5% to $93 million after a decline of 1% to $89 million in 2011. The average face amount of policies issued in 2012 was approximately $20 thousand.  

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance, focusing on middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was $282 million in 2012, a 2% decrease compared with $ 288 million in 2011. Life premium also declined 2% in 2011 from 2010. First year collected premium declined 15% in 2012, after having declined 10% in 2011. The average face amount of life policies issued in 2012 was approximately $23 thousand.  

The Liberty National Agencys net sales declined 11% to $32 million in 2012, after having declined 19% a year earlier. As is the case with all of our agencies, sales are driven by the size of the agent force. The Liberty agency had 1,419 producing agents at December 31, 2012, compared with 1,345 a year earlier, an increase of 6%. The producing agent count declined 33% during 2011.  

The recent declines in premium and sales were due primarily to changes in the cost structure of the agency that have affected agent counts in recent years. Several years ago, management began a process to convert the agency from a fixed expense, salary-based agency model to a commission-driven variable-cost model. Even though we knew the conversion would result in agent defections, the change had to be made to maintain acceptable underwriting margins on new business and ensure the long-term survival and growth of this distribution channel. This was a significant cultural change and it has been implemented gradually to minimize agency disruption as much as possible. Declines in agent count finally ceased in February, 2012 and there was a slow steady increase in agent count for the remainder of the year. Liberty has historically focused its marketing efforts in smaller rural areas in the southeastern United States. Going forward, management expects to grow this agency through nationwide geographic expansion into more urban areas and cross-selling individual life insurance to customers who purchased group health insurance through Libertys worksite marketing program.  

We also offer life insurance through Other Agencies consisting of the Military Agency, the United American Independent Agency, and other small sales agencies. The Military Agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 10% of life premium at December 31, 2012. The United American Independent Agency represented approximately 1% of Torchmarks total life premium at that date, as their sales of Torchmark products consist primarily of health insurance.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross margins, as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 11% in 2012 and 7% in 2011. The margin increased to $509 million in 2012 after rising to $461 million in 2011. Margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth. As a percentage of life insurance premium, the margins have risen steadily each year, largely due to improved persistency.

Health Insurance. Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement and Part D prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal Medicare program, cancer coverage, and accident coverage. All health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement and Part D are classified here as limited-benefit plans.  

Total health premium represented 37% of Torchmarks total premium income in 2012. Excluding Part D premium, health premium represented 26% of total premium income in 2012, compared with 28% in 2011 and 29% in 2010. Health underwriting margin, excluding Part D, accounted for 23% of the total in 2012, compared with 25% in 2011 and 28% in 2010. These declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment. Health results have been negatively affected by the discontinuance of sales in 2010 of a block of hospital-surgical limited-benefit products which became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. These products were also our highest-premium, lowest-margin products. Health results have also been negatively affected by the earlier restructuring of the Liberty National Agency as discussed under the caption Life Insurance. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Health insurance, excluding Medicare Part D. Health premium other than Part D has declined in each successive year presented, falling 1% in 2012 to $730 million and declining 6% in 2011. The declines in premium resulted primarily from the previously-mentioned run-off of a block of discontinued hospital-surgical plans. Net sales increased 22% in 2012 to $78 million, due in part to the acquisition of Family Heritage, which contributed 12% of the increase. Net sales declined 1% in 2011 and declined 33% in 2010. First-year collected premium increased 17% in 2012 after a 22% decline in 2011. Family Heritage accounted for 10% of the 2012 increase.  

Medicare Supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium, partially because Medicare Supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited-benefit products, but also because of improved sales in recent periods. Medicare Supplement premium represented 59% of non-Part D health premium in 2012, compared with 60% in 2011 and 58% in 2010.

The UA Independent Agency is Torchmarks largest in terms of health premium income and sales, producing 41% of health premium and 54% of health sales. This Agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose size range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies. Torchmark had 2,003 active producing agents at December 31, 2012 compared with 1,447 a year earlier. This Agency is our largest producer of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $272 million or 63% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2012. Net sales for this Agency increased 29% to $42 million in 2012, after having increased 2% in 2011 from $32 million in 2010. Total health premium income for the UA Independent Agency was $299 million in 2012, a 3% decline from 2011 premium of $306 million. Premium income also declined 3% in 2011. These declines in premium have resulted due to lapses of limited-benefit products being greater than new sales.  

The Family Heritage Agency was acquired by Torchmarks acquisition of Family Heritage on November 1, 2012 as discussed in Note 6Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This agency markets primarily limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return-of-premium feature whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and incorporation of Torchmarks recruiting programs. This agency contributed $30 million in health premium income during the two-month period of 2012. Annualized health premium in force at December 31, 2012 was $188 million.  

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency represented 36% of all Torchmark non-Part D health premium income at $264 million in 2012. The Liberty Agency markets limited-benefit health supplemental products consisting primarily of cancer insurance. Much of the Libertys health business is now generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. In 2012, health premium income in the Agency declined 9% from prior year premium of $290 million. As noted earlier, the premium decline was due primarily to the runoff of the block of discontinued hospital-surgical business, and the previously-discussed restructuring of this Agency to a commission-driven model.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency, predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, was our third largest health insurance distributor based on premium income in 2012. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans. Approximately 69% of the agencys 2012 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the plans by this Agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.  

Health premium at this agency was flat in 2012 at $80 million, after rising 1% in 2011. However, net health sales declined 9% to $9 million in 2012, after a 27% decline in 2011. Because this agency focuses on life products, net health sales comprised only 5% of the American Income Agencys total net sales in 2012.  

Direct Response, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups. In all three years considered, net health sales were approximately $5 million. In 2012, net health sales for this group represented approximately 3% of Direct Responses total life and health net sales. Direct Response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year. Health premium rose 2% in 2012 to $58 million and 5% in 2011.

Medicare Part D. Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, offers coverage under the governments Medicare Part D plan. The Medicare Part D plan is a stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for participating private insurers like United American. Under Part D, private carriers are the primary insurers, while CMS provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance. Our Medicare Part D product is sold through the Direct Response operation and to groups through the UA Independent Agency. Part D net sales were $114 million in 2012, compared with $115 million in 2011 and $39 million in 2010. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales, and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees. Total Medicare Part D premium was $318 million in 2012, compared with $197 million in 2011, an increase of 62%. Part D premium declined 6% in 2011.  

Changes in Part D premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees. At the beginning of the 2013 Part D plan year, United American had approximately 254 thousand enrollees, compared with 215 thousand at the beginning of the 2012 plan year, 144 thousand at the beginning of the 2011 plan year, and 157 thousand at the beginning of the 2010 plan year. United American had large growth in Part D enrollees in 2012 as a result of a new lower cost Part D plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of low-income auto-enrollees and to grow our own individual sales. Due to intensified price competition for the 2013 plan year, we will not qualify for as many new auto-enrollees in 2013 as we did in 2012. However, we expect that only a small number of the auto-enrollees assigned to us in 2012 will be reassigned to another Part D carrier. While the number of Part D enrollees at the beginning of plan year 2013 was higher than at the beginning of plan year 2012, it was lower than the number of enrollees at the end of 2012. The enrollee count grew throughout 2012 due to significant additions of low-income enrollees each month, but we lost several employer group Part D cases at the end of 2012. As such, we expect a lower average number of enrollees for 2013 than we had in 2012 and we anticipate a slight decline in Part D premium in 2013.  

We participate in the Medicare Part D program because of our experience with the senior-age market and with Medicare Supplements, the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for participating insurers, limited-risk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins, and the renewal of the business every year. Due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, as with any government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.

As presented in the following table, Torchmarks health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 4% to $197 million in 2012, but declined 5% in 2011 to $189 million. As a percentage of premium income, margins were 20% in both 2011 and 2010 as compared with 19% in 2012. The 2012 percentage reflects the greater proportion of Medicare Part D business which has a much higher benefit ratio.

This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Annuities. As described in Note 3Discontinued Operations, we sold our subsidiary United Investors on December 31, 2010. United Investors was our variable annuity carrier and a primary carrier of fixed annuities. Because we disposed of approximately 37% of our annuity deposit balance in the sale, including all of our variable annuities, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.  

Our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $1.35 billion, $1.29 billion, and $1.24 billion, respectively. Underwriting income was $3.5 million, $2.3 million, $1.3 million in each of the years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  

While the fixed annuity account balance has increased modestly each year over the prior year and underwriting income has increased each year as well, policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year. The majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are not based on account size. These charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. In each of the years presented, the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities accounting for the growth in underwriting margin. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits.  

Administrative expenses. Operating expenses are included in the Other and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2012.

Insurance administrative expenses rose 4% in 2012, after having increased 2% in 2011. As a percentage of premium, they increased .1% in 2011, but declined .2% in 2012 to 5.8%. The 2012 increase in total insurance administrative expense of $6.3 million was primarily the result of the expiration of a third party agreement under which we were reimbursed a net of $5.2 million in 2011 for providing policy administration services, and $1.6 million from the addition of Family Heritages expenses in 2012. The 11% decline in employee costs in 2011 was primarily due to unusually high employee health insurance costs in 2010. Stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of Torchmark stock has increased, resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options and not because of an increase in the number of grants. As stated in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense.  

As a result of the acquisition of Family Heritage in late 2012 as described in Note 6Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we incurred expenses related to the transaction of $2.9 million. Additionally, as mentioned in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies, we incurred two settlement expense issues in 2011 that related to events occurring many years ago: the settlement of a state administrative issue of $7 million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of $12 million. The latter item was settled in that amount in 2012. In addition to these two 2011 items, we sold aviation equipment in 2011 at a loss of $979 thousand. While all of these nonrecurring expenses were included in Operating expenses for the respective year in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance with accounting guidance, they are considered as non-operating expenses by management.  

Investments. We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs. We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $5.4 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess investment income declined $22 million or 9% in 2012 from the prior year. Excess investment income declined $6 million or 2% in 2011. Excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption. On a per diluted share basis, excess investment income rose 3% to $2.42 per share in 2012, after having risen 10% in the prior year. The favorable increases in the per share amounts relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share repurchases.  

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, as adjusted for the segment analysis, which rose 1% to $716 million in 2012. It increased 3% to $707 million in 2011 from $685 million in 2010. Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment. In a declining interest rate environment, the overall portfolio yield will decrease as new money is invested at lower yields, especially when the new investments are replacing higher-yielding investments that mature or are otherwise disposed of. Approximately 50% of the invested assets added in 2010 through 2012 replaced higher-yielding assets that matured or were disposed of during that period. This level of replacement activity was higher than normal.

We had more sales of investments than usual in each of the years 2010 through 2012. These sales were generally made due to credit concerns or for tax purposes. Additionally in 2012, we had an unusually large number of securities called. Fixed maturity securities are more likely to be called in a declining interest-rate environment. In addition to bonds with scheduled call dates, our portfolio includes bank-issued hybrid securities with provisions allowing the security to be called in the event of a change in capital treatment. Many banks chose to call their hybrid securities in 2012 because the Dodd-Frank Act phases out the partial equity credit historically allowed for these securities.  

At December 31, 2012, we still held $262 million of bank hybrids callable without a make-whole provision. The average yield on these securities was 7.26%. Approximately 51% of these securities was below investment grade. To the extent these are called, there would be a reduction in net investment income. However, the ratio of below-investment-grade securities to our total investment portfolio and statutory required capital would also decrease.  

In 2010, growth in net investment income slightly exceeded the growth in the portfolio. Because of the uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets in 2009, we held significantly more cash and short-term investments than in other years. Holding this larger balance of low-yielding securities in 2009 resulted in the unusually high growth rate in 2010 as these lower-yielding cash balances were invested in 2010.  

Excess investment income is reduced by the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities, because we consider these amounts to be components of the profitability of our insurance segments. Required interest is the actuarial interest assumption used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. Essentially all of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products (formerly SFAS 60, now incorporated into ASC 944-20-05), which mandates that interest rate assumptions be locked in for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the assumed discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. That rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed except in the event of a premium deficiency. The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. As such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business. Information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table.

The combined average interest discount rate has risen in each of the last three years due to the changes in the mix of the in force business discussed above.  

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the Consolidated Statements of Operations to financing costs.  

The table below presents the components of financing costs.  

Analysis of Financing Costs  

(Amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) See Principles of Consolidation in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of deconsolidation.  

Financing costs increased $3 million or 3% in 2012. They rose $2 million or 3% in 2011. The increase in financing costs in 2012 reflects the increased interest expense from the issuance in September 2012 of $300 million principal amount of our 3.8% Senior Notes due in 2022, $150 million of which is eliminated in consolidation. Also in September, 2012, we issued our 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2052 for $125 million principal amount but called our $120 million 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities one month later. The 2011 and 2012 increases in interest on short-term debt were primarily a result of the $2.1 million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility, arising from the December, 2010 restructuring of our credit facility. More information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the Financial Condition section of this report and in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates. Therefore, Torchmark would benefit if rates, especially long-term rates, were to rise.  

However, growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs, such as we have experienced in recent periods. In an extended low-interest-rate environment, the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long-term rates. We believe, however, the decline would be relatively slow, as, on average, only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years.  

In response to the lower interest rates, we reduced the discount rate on life policies issued in 2012. We also raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in 2012. The increased premiums will provide additional margin on these policies to help offset the possible future reductions in excess investment income and have not had a detrimental impact on sales.  

Because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. Due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted-average discount rate of our in force block, we dont expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.  

Investment Acquisitions. Torchmarks current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities (maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. Further, we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, we consider investing in short-term securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time. During calendar years 2010 through 2012, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, primarily with longer-term maturities as presented in the chart below.  

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the worst call date. Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date.

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment. However, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.  

During the three years 2010 through 2012, we have invested primarily in investment-grade corporate bonds. Purchases in 2012 and 2011 consisted almost entirely of these corporates. During 2010, we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds, primarily Build America Bonds authorized by the American Recovery and Retirement Act of 2009. The investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services. In assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds, we took into account a number of factors, including the geographic location of the municipalities.  

New cash flow available for investment is primarily provided through our insurance operations, but has also been affected by other factors. Issuer calls, as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years were a factor. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds available for investment, but as noted earlier in this discussion, they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $650 million in 2012, $187 million in 2011, and $109 million in 2010. The higher level of acquisitions in 2012 was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2012 calls.  

Portfolio Analysis. Because Torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmarks components of invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2012 with the latest industry data.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2012, approximately 96% of our investments at book value (or amortized cost) were in a diversified fixed-maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, made up an additional 3%. The remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities, mortgage loans, and other long-term and short-term investments.

At December 31, 2012, fixed maturities had a fair value of $13.5 billion, compared with $11.9 billion at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, fixed maturities were in a $1,578 million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of $964 million at December 31, 2011. Approximately 78% of our fixed maturity assets at December 31, 2012 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 6% were redeemable preferred stocks. This compares with 77% corporate bonds and 11% redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2011. On a combined basis, residential mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were less than 1% of the assets at amortized cost at December 31, 2012. The $65 million of CDOs at amortized cost made up less than 0.6% of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. The $13 million of residential mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA. For more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2012 and 2011, including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products, Torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery. Even though these fixed maturity investments are available for sale, Torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired.  

Additional information concerning the fixed-maturity portfolio is as follows.

Credit Risk Sensitivity. Credit risk relates to the level of uncertainty that a securitys issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 85% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring only investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by spreading investments over a large number of issuers and a wide range of industry sectors.  

The following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2012.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2012, approximately 27% of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost (26% at fair value) were in the financial sector, including 15% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 7% in banks at amortized cost. Financial guarantors, mortgage insurers, and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5% of the portfolio at amortized cost. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 17% of the portfolio at amortized cost. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 410 issuers in a wide variety of sectors. As previously noted, gross unrealized losses were $89 million at December 31, 2012, declining from $239 million a year earlier. The portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1,578 million at December 31, 2012.

The composite rating for each security is the average of the securitys ratings as assigned by Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average.  

Fixed Maturities by Rating  

At December 31, 2012  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of A- based on amortized cost. Approximately 95% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other than $11 million of German government bonds at amortized cost and fair value, we have no direct exposure to European sovereign debt.  

Our current investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.  

An analysis of changes in below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows.

Market Risk Sensitivity. Torchmarks financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the companys investment portfolio. Since 96% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and generally the intent to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.  

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.  

Investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.  

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.  

The following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012.

   *   Written down due to other-than-temporary impairment.  

As described in Note 4Investments under the caption Other-than temporary impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2010 through 2012 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and in our Critical Accounting Policies in this report. The writedowns resulted in pretax charges of $5.6 million in 2012 ($3.6 million after tax), $20 thousand in 2011 ($13 thousand after tax), and $5 million in 2010 ($3.2 million after tax). In 2010, we acquired $7.3 million book value of our 9 1/4% Senior Notes at a cost of $8.9 million, resulting in an after-tax loss on debt redemption of $1.1 million. In 2012, we redeemed our 7.1% Trust Originated Preferred Securities, recording a loss on redemption of $4.1 million ($2.7 million after tax).

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Liquidity. Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.  

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity. The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. The leading source of the excess cash is investment income. However, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash comes from underwriting income.  

Parent Company Liquidity. Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, operating expenses of the Parent, and Parent Company dividends to Torchmark shareholders. In 2012, the Parent received $493 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries, as compared with $790 million in 2011 and $401 million in 2010. The 2011 dividend included $305 million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of United Investors. Including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2012 of approximately $371 million, compared with $672 million in 2011 including the $305 million from the sale of United Investors. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2013, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive approximately $506 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries, and that approximately $365 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of Note 12Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company. As additional liquidity, the Parent held $2 million of cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2012, compared with $27 million a year earlier. The Parent also had available a $144 million receivable from subsidiaries at December 31, 2012.  

Short-Term Borrowings. An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. As of December 31, 2012, we had available $177 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, as we also had a year earlier. There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended December 31, 2012. For detailed information about this line of credit facility, see the Commercial Paper section of Note 11Debt.  

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2013 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, a short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.  

Consolidated Liquidity. Consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $943 million in 2012, compared with $859 million in 2011 and $1.03 billion in 2010. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies have received $661 million in investment calls and tenders and $76 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2012. Maturities, tenders, and calls totaled $410 million in 2011 and $639 million in 2010.

Our cash and short-term investments were $157 million at year-end 2012 and $105 million at year-end 2011. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $13.6 billion at December 31, 2012. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As described in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and under the subcaption Funded Debt, Torchmark had outstanding $120 million (par amount) 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities at December 31, 2011, but these securities were redeemed during 2012. The capital trust liable for these securities was the legal entity responsible for the securities and facilitated the payment of dividends to shareholders. The trust was an off-balance sheet arrangement which we were required to deconsolidate in accordance with GAAP rules, because the capital trust was considered to be a variable interest entity in which we had no variable interest. While these liabilities were not on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, they were represented by Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust in the amount of $124 million which was on our balance sheet at December 31, 2011 under the caption Due to affiliates.  

As a part of its above-mentioned credit facility, Torchmark had outstanding $198 million in stand-by letters of credit at December 31, 2012. However, these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole.  

As of December 31, 2012, we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities other than as described above. All of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 15Commitments and Contingencies.  

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of December 31, 2012.

 (2)   Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (4)   Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at December 31, 2012. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $10.7 billion at December 31, 2012, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources. Torchmarks capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), long-term funded debt, and shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2012, our 7 3/8% Notes due 2013 have been reclassified from long-term funded debt to short-term debt because of its current maturity in August 2013. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The carrying value of the long-term funded debt was $990 million at December 31, 2012, compared with $914 million a year earlier. As fully explained in Note 11Debt, we issued $300 million principal amount of 3.8% Senior Notes due in 2022 in September, 2012 for proceeds of $297 million in a public offering. However, $150 million of the offering was acquired by Torchmark insurance subsidiaries and was eliminated in consolidation, resulting in net proceeds after issue expenses to the consolidated group of $147 million. The majority of the $297 million proceeds received by the Parent were used to acquire Family Heritage as described in Note 6Acquisition. The balance was invested to be used for the redemption of our 7 3/8% Senior Notes that mature in August, 2013, or at an earlier time if opportunities to repurchase these notes become available, and for other corporate purposes.  

As also discussed in Note 11, we issued $125 million principal amount of our 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2052 in a September, 2012 public offering. This issue resulted in net proceeds after issue expenses of $121 million, and were used to redeem our 7.1% Trust Originated Preferred Securities in the amount of $120 million plus accrued dividends for a total cost of $121 million.  

Also noted in Note 11 was our assumption of $20 million of Trust Preferred Securities in connection with our acquisition of Family Heritage. These securities bear interest at a variable rate, the three-month LIBOR plus 330 basis points, which is reset each quarter. While these securities are callable by us at any time, we have no immediate plans to do so.  

Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325% of required regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. At December 31, 2012, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios of approximately 348%. Should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325%, management has more than sufficient liquidity at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325%.  

As noted under the caption Summary of Operations in this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program. Under this program, we acquired 7 million shares at a cost of $360 million in 2012, 19 million shares at a cost of $788 million in 2011, and 6 million shares for $204 million in 2010. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption Summary of Operations in this report.  

Torchmark has increased the dividend on its common shares over the past three years. In the first quarter of 2010, the dividend was increased from $.0933 per share to $.10 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010, it was further increased to $.1067 per share. In the second quarter of 2011, it was raised to $.12 per share and in the first quarter of 2012, it was again increased to $.15 per share.  

Shareholders equity was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012, compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 2011. During the twelve months since December 31, 2011, shareholders equity was reduced by the $360 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another $210 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises, but has been increased by the $529 million of net income, $204 million from option exercises, and by after-tax unrealized gains of $404 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved.  

We plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future. Excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. From time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.  

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmarks capital structure.  

Selected Financial Data  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   Amount added to (deducted from) comprehensive income to produce the stated GAAP item  

 (2)   Includes the value of insurance purchased  

 (3)   Includes Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2011 and 2010 in the amount of $124 million.  

 (4)   Torchmarks debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders equity.  

FASB guidance provides for an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder

 liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we have not elected this option.  

Torchmarks ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 10.5 times in 2012, compared with 10.3 times in 2011 and 10.9 times in 2010. This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption Investments in this report.  

Financial Strength Ratings.  

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poors and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2012.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.  

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poors Corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.  

OTHER ITEMS  

Litigation. Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims that are tried in Alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages (including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to Note 15Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Future Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Approximately 82% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2012 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Future Policy Benefits. Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. Torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended December 31, 2012.  

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.  

Deferred Acquisition Costs. Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies under the caption Deferred Acquisition Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance purchased, is included in deferred acquisition costs. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in Note 1.  

Approximately 98% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2012 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked-in at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2012.  

The remaining 2% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2012.  

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable. This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate  

50  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.  

Valuation of Fixed Maturities. We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption Market Risk Sensitivity in this report. However, as discussed under the caption Financial Condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.  

At times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and in Note 4Investments under the captions Fair Value Measurements in both notes.  

Impairment of Investments. We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussions under the captions Investments and Realized Gains and Losses in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.  

Defined benefit pension plans. We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2012, our gross liability under these funded plans was $353 million, but was offset by assets of $278 million.  

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. Our discount rate, rate of return on assets, and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in Note 9Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. Note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.
