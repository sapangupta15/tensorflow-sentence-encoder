Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Overview

Business overview and strategy

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television and radio stations, Internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company continues to increase its investment in both Company-owned and acquired premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company’s content on digital and other platforms through licensing and subscription services, including the Company’s owned digital streaming services; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits. The Company’s continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide it with incremental advertising and non-advertising revenues.

Operational highlights 2015 vs. 2014 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) See page II-6 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For 2015, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (“EPS”) was up 19% from 2014, reflecting higher net earnings from continuing operations and lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program and the split-off of Outdoor Americas Inc. (“Outdoor Americas”) in the third quarter of 2014. In 2015, EPS included a pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses to their fair value, restructuring charges, and gains from the sales of Internet businesses in China. In 2014, EPS included an impairment charge associated with a radio station swap, restructuring charges, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt. On an adjusted basis, excluding these discrete items, EPS increased 12%. The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of these discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company. These adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures. See page II-6 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

II-4

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For 2015, the 1% increase in revenues reflected continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, partially offset by lower advertising and content licensing and distribution revenues. Affiliate and subscription fees increased 15% as a result of growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, reflecting the benefit from recently renegotiated agreements, as well as higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. Advertising revenues decreased 3% primarily reflecting lower local advertising revenues as a result of the benefit in 2014 from midterm elections and lower radio advertising sales. Total advertising revenues benefited from 1% growth in network advertising, which increased despite fewer sporting events broadcast on the CBS Television Network. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% reflecting lower domestic television licensing revenues, which were partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues.

Operating income was down 17% from 2014. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impairment charges, restructuring charges, and gains from the sales of Internet businesses in China, operating income declined 4% primarily as a result of increased investment in programming and new digital distribution initiatives. 

The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.42 billion in 2015 and $1.21 billion in 2014. Included in operating cash flow for 2014 were payments of $360 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for early redemption premiums. Free cash flow for 2015 was $1.23 billion compared with $1.00 billion for 2014. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow” on pages II-27 and II-28 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

Segments

CBS Corp. operates in the following four segments:

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group, CBS Interactive and CBS Films. Entertainment’s revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 61%, 60%, and 62% to consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and 46%, 44%, and 53% to total segment operating income in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks’ revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 16% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2015 and 2014, and 15% in 2013, and 33% to total segment operating income in each of the years 2015 and 2014, and 29% in 2013.

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster’s consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Atria Books. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 6% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013, and 4% to total segment operating income in 2015 and 3% in each of the years 2014 and 2013.

LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales and retransmission fees. The Local Broadcasting segment contributed 19%, 20% and 19% to consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and 27%, 30%, and 27% to total segment operating income in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Consolidated Results of Operations—2015 vs. 2014 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2015, the 3% decrease in advertising revenues was principally driven by lower local advertising revenues, mainly from the benefit to 2014 from midterm elections and 6% lower radio advertising revenues. These declines were partially offset by growth in network advertising revenues, which increased 1% despite the broadcast of fewer sporting events on the CBS Television Network in 2015. The increase in network advertising reflects higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, primarily as a result of increased demand. The increase is also driven by more inventory available to be sold at higher prices in the scatter market as a result of fewer units sold prior to the start of the 2015/2016 television broadcast season (“Upfront”) compared with the 2014/2015 season. (See pages I-2 and II-8 for further descriptions of the scatter and Upfront advertising markets.)

II-7

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In 2016, national and local advertising revenues will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract with the National Football League (“NFL”). The local advertising revenue comparison will also benefit from higher political advertising spending, mainly in the second half of the year, associated with the U.S. Presidential election. For national advertising, the CBS Television Network’s Upfront for the 2015/2016 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2015 through the middle of September 2016, resulted in pricing increases and lower overall volume compared with the prior season. As a result, more advertising spots are available in the scatter advertising market, when advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming. Overall advertising revenues for the Company will be dependent on demand in the overall advertising marketplace and ratings for its programming. 

Content licensing and distribution

Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced television programming for multiple media platforms and in various geographic locations; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For 2015, the 2% decrease in content licensing and distribution revenues reflects lower domestic television licensing revenues, partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues. Significant contributors to domestic television licensing revenues in 2015 included Elementary and NCIS, while 2014 included Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0, and Dexter. 

Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of Company-owned television series for multi-year licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. Unrecognized revenues attributable to license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $847 million and $1.02 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of the end of 2015 the Company had approximately 400 episodes of scripted original programming that had not yet been made available in the secondary domestic marketplace (See page II-46 for a description of the secondary marketplace).

Total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $3.83 billion and $3.57 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.69 billion in 2016, $1.03 billion in 2017, $552 million in 2018, $348 million in 2019, and $214 million in 2020 and thereafter. 

Affiliate and subscription fees

Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), as well as for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); subscription fees for online content; and revenues received for the distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. For 2015, the 15% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects growth in station affiliation fees, retransmission fees, and cable affiliate fees from growth in rates; higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events; and revenues from new digital distribution platforms. In 2016, the Company expects continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees. Over the next few years the Company expects to renew a significant portion of its agreements with station affiliates and MVPDs. This, along with the Company’s new digital distribution initiatives, including CBS All Access and Showtime’s digital streaming subscription offering, are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees over the next several years.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

International Revenues

International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues. The Company generated approximately 14% and 13% of its total revenues from international regions in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the television broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. For 2015, programming expenses remained flat with 2014 as increased sports programming costs associated with higher revenues from NFL broadcasts and pay-per-view boxing events were offset by lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series.

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. For 2015, the 13% increase in production expenses reflects an increased investment in internally developed television series as well as higher costs associated with the mix of titles sold under television licensing agreements in 2015 compared with 2014. The Company produced approximately 20% more hours of original scripted programming in 2015 compared with 2014.

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television content, such as print and advertising. For 2015, the 6% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflects lower participations and residuals associated with the decrease in licensing revenues.

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support. 

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2015, the 6% decrease in depreciation and amortization was the result of intangibles and property and equipment that became fully amortized. 

Restructuring Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2015, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $81 million, reflecting $48 million of severance costs and $33 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. These restructuring activities are expected to reduce the Company’s annual cost structure by approximately $95 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $26 million, reflecting $17 million of severance costs and $9 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative settlements for the 2015 and 2014 restructuring charges were $53 million, of which $35 million was for severance costs and $18 million related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. The Company expects to substantially utilize its restructuring reserves by the end of 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impairment Charges

During 2015, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $484 million to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses in 18 markets to their fair value. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). 

II-10

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In December 2014, the Company completed a radio station swap with Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. through which the Company exchanged 13 of its radio stations in Tampa and Charlotte as well as one radio station in Philadelphia, for two radio stations in Philadelphia and three radio stations in Miami. In connection with the radio station swap, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $52 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.

Gain on Sales of Businesses

In 2015, the Company disposed of Internet businesses in China which resulted in gains of $139 million ($131 million, net of tax).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For 2014, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million reflected a pretax loss associated with the Company’s redemption of $1.07 billion of its long-term debt.

Other Items, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Provision for Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. The Company’s income tax provision for 2015 included a tax benefit of $187 million associated with a noncash impairment charge of $484 million to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses to their fair value, and a tax provision of $8 million related to gains from the sales of Internet businesses in China of $139 million. In 2014, the Company’s income tax provision included a tax benefit of $133 million associated with the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million. For 2016, the Company’s annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2015, the 4% increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the 19% increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations was driven by a 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million ($219 million, net of tax) and 2015 gains from the sales of Internet businesses in China of $139 million ($131 million, net of tax), partially offset by a 2015 impairment charge of $484 million ($297 million, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses to their fair value. The diluted EPS comparison also benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program and the split-off of Outdoor Americas during the third quarter of 2014. 

Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations

The following table sets forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

During 2014, the Company completed the disposition of Outdoor Americas, which was previously a subsidiary of the Company and has been renamed OUTFRONT Media Inc. Outdoor Americas has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. In connection with the 

II-12

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Company’s plan to dispose of Outdoor Americas, in January 2014 Outdoor Americas borrowed $1.60 billion. On April 2, 2014, Outdoor Americas completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) through which it sold 23.0 million shares, or approximately 19%, of its common stock for $28.00 per share. Proceeds from the IPO aggregated $615 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company received $2.04 billion of the combined IPO and debt proceeds from Outdoor Americas. On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the disposition of its 81% ownership of Outdoor Americas common stock through a tax-free split-off (the “Split-Off”) through which the Company accepted 44.7 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 97.0 million shares of Outdoor Americas common stock that it owned. In aggregate, the Company received $4.76 billion from the disposition of Outdoor Americas, including the cash from the IPO and debt proceeds, and the fair value of the shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were accepted in the Split-Off of $2.72 billion. The Split-Off resulted in a gain of $1.56 billion, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations for 2014 and is calculated as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Split-Off was a tax-free transaction and therefore, there was no tax impact on the gain. 

Net Earnings and Diluted EPS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Included in net earnings for 2014 is the gain of $1.56 billion, or $2.78 per diluted share, on the disposal of Outdoor Americas.

Consolidated Results of Operations— 2014 vs. 2013 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2014, the 4% decrease in advertising revenues reflected the benefit to 2013 from the CBS Television Network’s Super Bowl broadcast, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract. Additionally, four fewer NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship (“NCAA Tournament”) games were broadcast on CBS during 2014. Taken together these items impacted the advertising revenue comparison by five percentage points. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of Thursday Night Football on CBS in 2014 as well as political advertising spending associated with midterm elections.

II-13

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Content licensing and distribution

For 2014, content licensing and distribution revenues were comparable with 2013 reflecting higher revenues from the licensing of the Company’s television programming offset by lower revenues from book sales and theatrical releases. Significant contributors to television licensing revenues in 2014 included Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0, and Dexter and in 2013 included NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife.

Affiliate and subscription fees

For 2014, the 6% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflected higher rates across the Company partially offset by lower revenues from Showtime Networks’ distribution of pay-per-view boxing events.

International Revenues

International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues. The Company generated approximately 13% of its total revenues from international regions in each of 2014 and 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2014, the 4% decrease in programming expenses was primarily driven by the absence of costs associated with the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl in 2013. Programming expenses for 2014 also reflected an increased investment in programming, primarily for Thursday Night Football on CBS, partially offset by lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series during 2014.

For 2014, production expenses remained flat with 2013 as an increased investment in internally developed television programming was offset by lower costs associated with the mix of titles licensed under television licensing arrangements.

For 2014, the 7% increase in participation, distribution and royalty costs was principally due to higher participations and residuals associated with the mix of titles licensed under television licensing arrangements, partially offset by lower advertising costs for feature films.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 3% decrease in SG&A expenses reflects lower stock-based compensation expense, driven by a change in the Company’s stock price.

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 3% decrease in depreciation and amortization reflected lower amortization resulting from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized during 2014.

Restructuring charges

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $20 million, reflecting $14 million of severance costs and $6 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. The 2013 restructuring reserve was substantially utilized by December 31, 2014.

Interest expense/income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 3% decrease in interest expense was driven by the Company’s debt refinancing during 2014. During 2014, the Company issued $1.75 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds principally for the early redemption of $1.07 billion of its outstanding debt, which was at significantly higher interest rates, and also redeemed $99 million of outstanding 8.875% notes upon maturity (See “Capital Structure”).

During 2013, the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe for $225 million. Outdoor Europe is presented as a discontinued operation. For 2013, net earnings from discontinued operations include a gain on the disposal of Outdoor Europe and an after-tax charge of $110 million related to Outdoor Europe. This charge was associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement and the estimated fair value of guarantees, which historically were intercompany but upon the closing of the transaction became third-party guarantees.

Segment Results of Operations - 2015 vs. 2014 

The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding restructuring charges, impairment charges, and gain on sales of businesses, if any, (“Segment Operating Income”) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments (“segment profit measure”) in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company began presenting Segment Operating Income as its segment profit measure in the first quarter of 2015 in order to align with the primary method the Company’s management began using in 2015 to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to its segments. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to the Company’s consolidated net earnings is presented in Note 17 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

2015 vs. 2014 

For 2015, the 2% increase in revenues was primarily driven by 47% growth in affiliate and subscription fees. Network advertising revenues increased 1%, despite the broadcast of fewer sporting events on the CBS Television Network in 2015, reflecting higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, primarily as a result of increased demand. The increase is also driven by more inventory available to be sold at higher prices in the scatter market as a result of fewer units sold in the Upfront for the 2015/2016 broadcast season, compared with the 2014/2015 season. Overall advertising revenues for the Entertainment segment remained flat as the increase in network advertising revenues was offset by the impact from the sale of an Internet business in China during the first quarter of 2015. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 3% reflecting lower domestic television licensing revenues, which were partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues. Significant contributors to domestic television licensing revenues in 2015 included Elementary and NCIS, while 2014 included Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0, and Criminal Minds. 

The decrease in operating income of 2% was primarily driven by increased investment in programming and digital distribution initiatives. For 2015 and 2014 restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting operating facilities.

During 2016, results are expected to benefit from continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees and the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract. Revenue comparisons will also be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of television series for multi-year licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition.

Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

n/m - not meaningful

2015 vs. 2014

For 2015, the 3% increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues from new long-term agreements for the international licensing of Showtime original series; pay-per-view boxing events; and affiliates, as well as revenues from new digital distribution initiatives. These increases were offset by lower domestic licensing revenues as 2014 benefited from significant domestic streaming sales of Dexter. As of December 31, 2015, subscriptions totaled approximately 77 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 55 million for CBS Sports Network and 33 million for Smithsonian Networks.

Operating income decreased 3% as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher costs associated with the increased pay-per-view boxing revenues and the mix of titles sold under television licensing arrangements. 

During 2015, the Company launched its digital streaming subscription offering of Showtime that is available both on a stand-alone basis and through third-party digital platforms. Subscribers to this offering have on-demand access to Showtime original series, theatrical feature films, documentaries and sports-related programming, as well as the live east and west coast linear feeds of Showtime.

2015 vs. 2014

For 2015, revenues increased slightly from 2014 with digital book sales representing 25% of Publishing’s total revenues. Best-selling titles for 2015 included the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2014 release All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr, The Wright Brothers by David McCullough and Finders Keepers by Stephen King.

The increase in operating income of 13% primarily reflected a favorable product mix, including strong backlist and digital audio sales, and lower production and distribution costs.

2015 vs. 2014

For 2015, the 5% decrease in revenues primarily reflected lower political advertising revenues as 2014 benefited from midterm elections, as well as lower radio revenues. The lower radio revenues, which decreased 6%, reflected continued softness in the radio advertising marketplace as well as fewer radio stations and lower political revenues. CBS Television Stations revenues declined 5%, reflecting lower political revenues, partially offset by growth in affiliate and subscription fees.

The decrease in operating income of 13% was driven by the revenue decline, which was partially offset by lower programming and employee related costs as a result of recent cost-cutting measures. Restructuring charges in 2015 and 2014 reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pretax, noncash impairment charge of $484 million to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses in 18 markets to their fair value. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). In 2014, in connection with a radio station swap with Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $52 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. Under the swap, the Company exchanged 13 of its radio stations in Tampa and Charlotte as well as one radio station in Philadelphia, for two radio stations in Philadelphia and three radio stations in Miami. 

In 2016, advertising revenues are expected to benefit from increased political spending associated with the U.S. presidential election and the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract. Continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees is also expected in 2016.

2014 vs. 2013 

For 2014, the 4% decrease in revenues reflected lower advertising revenues and content licensing and distribution revenues, partially offset by growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues. Advertising revenues decreased 7%, mainly driven by the benefit to 2013 from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on CBS once every three years through 2022 under the current contract, and four fewer NCAA Tournament games broadcast on CBS in 2014. These decreases were partially offset by advertising revenues from the broadcast of Thursday Night Football on CBS, which premiered on CBS in 2014. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% reflecting the timing of theatrical releases and television licensing revenues. Television licensing revenues in 2014 included the first-cycle domestic syndication sales of Blue Bloods and Hawaii Five-0 and in 2013 included NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife.

The decrease in operating income of 18% primarily reflected an increased investment in programming, primarily for NFL games. Restructuring charges for 2014 primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting operating facilities and 2013 principally reflected costs associated with exiting certain international operations and severance costs.

Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2014 vs. 2013 

For 2014, the 5% increase in revenues was driven by higher revenues from the licensing of Showtime original series for digital streaming, mainly Dexter and Californication. Revenue growth also reflects higher cable affiliate fees, primarily reflecting rate increases. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. As of December 31, 2014, subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 55 million for CBS Sports Network and 30 million for Smithsonian Networks.

The increase in operating income of 11% was primarily a result of the increased revenues and lower programming costs from the timing of premieres.

Financial Position

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The increase in receivables is primarily associated with the licensing of television programming and higher network advertising revenues. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 1.7% at December 31, 2015 compared with 1.4% at December 31, 2014.

II-25

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating Activities. In 2015, the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations resulted from early-redemption premiums paid in 2014 in connection with the Company’s debt refinancing, with no comparable amount in 2015, and lower payments for income taxes, mainly resulting from federal tax refunds received in 2015. These increases were partially offset by increased investment in programming.

In 2014, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations compared with 2013 reflected the above-mentioned debt redemption premiums, as well as the benefit to 2013 from CBS’s Super Bowl broadcast and the timing of payments for sports programming. These declines were partially offset by contributions of $150 million in 2013 to prefund the Company’s qualified pension plans, with no comparable amount in 2014, as well as higher collections from television licensing agreements.

Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2015, cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected payments for a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction related to a previously disposed business that is accounted for as a discontinued operation. For 2014 and 2013, cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating activities of Outdoor Americas and Outdoor Europe. Also included in 2013 was a payment of $171 million associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement in connection with the sale of Outdoor Europe.

Investing Activities

(c) 2015 was primarily related to sales of Internet businesses in China and 2013 was principally related to the sale of Outdoor Europe.

(d) For 2014 cash flow used for investing activities from discontinued operations principally reflects the disposition of Outdoor Americas’ cash as well as the capital expenditures of Outdoor Americas. 2013 primarily reflects Outdoor Americas’ capital expenditures.

Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations for 2014 principally reflects the net proceeds from Outdoor Americas’ long-term debt borrowings and IPO.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and including capital expenditures. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry. 

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Dividends

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company declared total per share dividends of $.60, $.54, and $.48, respectively, which resulted in total annual dividends of $293 million, $296 million and $295 million, respectively. 

On January 28, 2016, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2016. 

Share Repurchase Program

During 2015, the Company repurchased 51.7 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock under its share repurchase program for $2.80 billion, at an average cost of $54.18 per share. At December 31, 2015, $2.00 billion of authorization remained under the share repurchase program.

Capital Structure

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the year ended December 31, 2015, debt issuances were as follows:

January 2015, $600 million 3.50% senior notes due 2025 

January 2015, $600 million 4.60% senior notes due 2045

July 2015, $800 million 4.00% senior notes due 2026

The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued $1.75 billion of senior notes and redeemed or repurchased $1.17 billion of senior notes and debentures, of which $1.07 billion was redeemed or repurchased prior to maturity, resulting in a pretax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million.

At December 31, 2015, the Company’s scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During January 2016, the Company repaid its $200 million of outstanding 7.625% senior debentures upon maturity. 

Commercial Paper

At December 31, 2014 the Company had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its $2.5 billion commercial paper program of $616 million, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.46% and with maturities of less than forty-five days. There were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2015.

Credit Facility

At December 31, 2015, the Company had a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2019 (the “Credit Facility”). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company’s option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or the London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.6x.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company’s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.

The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.49 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company’s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company’s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $2.49 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2015, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

II-29

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The Company’s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for the Company’s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $2.00 billion is expected to come from the Company’s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $2.00 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. The Company expects to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2016. This timing is subject to market and business conditions, and remains at the discretion of management. These repurchases are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2015 payments due by period under the Company’s significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $9.21 billion for sports programming rights, $1.79 billion relating to the production and licensing of television, radio, and film programming, and $905 million for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding capital leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases.

(f) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals.

The table above excludes $104 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation. 

In 2016, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $52 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2016, the Company expects to contribute

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

approximately $52 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company’s portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

Guarantees

During 2013, the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe. The Company remained the guarantor of certain of Outdoor Europe’s obligations, including franchise payment obligations under certain transit franchise agreements. Generally, the Company would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-performance by the buyer. These agreements have varying terms, with the majority of the obligations guaranteed under these agreements expiring over the next seven years. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s maximum exposure under the guaranteed obligations is approximately $26 million. The carrying value of the guarantee liability of approximately $14 million and $28 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in “Liabilities of discontinued operations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company also has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $193 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Programming and Production Costs

Accounting for the Company’s television production costs requires management’s judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

II-31

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and timing of the expensing of these costs.

Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test.

FCC Licenses—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company’s radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2015, the Company had FCC license book values for stations in 14 television markets and 25 radio markets.

 For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each market that management estimates has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. For the 2015 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for 10 television markets. For each of these markets, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For FCC licenses in the remaining television markets and all of the radio markets, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-

up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. The overall market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry.

The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2015 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 For the 2015 quantitative impairment test, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values of the FCC licenses in 18 radio markets were lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recognized a pretax noncash impairment charge of $484 million related to radio FCC licenses in these markets. This impairment was the result of a sustained decline in industry projections for the radio advertising marketplace since 2014.

For the remaining seven radio and four television markets, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in each market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. Two radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $203 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and two radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $193 million, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. In addition, the estimated fair value of one television market, which had a carrying value of FCC licenses of $167 million, exceeded its carrying value by 5%. In each of the remaining radio and television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values by more than 10%. 

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television and radio stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local radio or television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to the Company’s current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in any local radio and/or television advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in further impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At December 31, 2015 the Company had seven reporting units. The Company’s reporting units are one level below its operating segments, except for the Publishing reporting unit, which is the same as its operating segment because this operating segment has only one component. For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. For the 2015 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for three reporting units. For each of these reporting units, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each

industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that for these three reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For 2015, the Company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for four reporting units: CBS Interactive, CBS Sports Network, Publishing and CBS Radio. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). The Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in similar estimated fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. 

For the 2015 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of each of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore the second step of the impairment test was unnecessary. The fair value of the CBS Interactive, CBS Sports Network, and Publishing reporting units each exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 15%, while the estimated fair value of the CBS Radio reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $1.86 billion at December 31, 2015, exceeded its carrying value, after the FCC licenses impairment charge, by less than 1%. Following are the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the CBS Radio reporting unit:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. For the CBS Radio reporting unit, considering the narrow margin between the estimated fair value and carrying value, any downward revisions to its estimated fair value could cause the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its carrying value. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any noncash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Reserves and Legal Matters

Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these

estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company’s pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2015, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased from the prior year end due primarily to unfavorable performance of pension plan assets partially offset by an increase in the discount rate. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $123 million and will not have a material impact on the 2015 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $9 million to 2016 pension expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized tax benefits of $9 million and $7 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $104 million at December 31, 2015 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

Legal Matters 

General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, ‘‘litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in 

II-35

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had pending approximately 36,030 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 41,100 as of December 31, 2014 and 45,150 as of December 31, 2013. During 2015, the Company received approximately 3,670 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 8,740 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. In 2015, as the result of an insurance settlement, insurance recoveries exceeded the Company’s after tax costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims by approximately $5 million. In 2014, the Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance and taxes were approximately $11 million. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to modify this exposure. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, which are generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $291 million and $152 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.

Interest Risk

All of the Company’s long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2014, in connection with the issuance of its $600 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2019, the Company entered into $600 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements to hedge this debt. During 2015, prior to maturity, the Company settled these interest rate swaps and received $12 million in cash, plus accrued interest. The resulting increase in the carrying value of the previously hedged debt is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2015 but in the future may use derivatives to modify its exposure to interest rates.

Credit Risk

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2015 or 2014, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.
