Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  

 Overview  

 The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable program services, television content production and distribution, motion pictures, publishing, radio stations, television stations, interactive businesses, and outdoor advertising. The Company's principal strategy is to create and acquire content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company also continues to pursue opportunities to grow its revenue streams, including licensing its content for exhibition on digital and other platforms; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and increasingly monetizing content viewership and ratings as industry measurements evolve to reflect changing viewership habits. The Company's continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide it with incremental advertising and non-advertising revenues and serves to de-risk and diversify the Company's business model.  

 For 2012, the Company's diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations of $2.48 increased $.44, or 22%, from $2.04 for 2011. This growth was primarily driven by 3% higher revenues, increased profitability of television licensing revenues and lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the Company's share repurchases. The revenue growth reflects increases across all major revenue streams, including higher revenues from licensing the Company's programming for digital streaming and domestic and international syndication, higher cable network affiliate fees and retransmission revenues from MVPDs, and higher political advertising sales. Total advertising revenues for 2012, which represented 60% of the Company's total revenues, grew 1% reflecting a steady advertising marketplace. For 2012, operating income of $2.98 billion increased 14% from $2.62 billion for 2011 with an increase in the Company's operating income margin of two percentage points to 21%.  

 The Company expects to benefit from continued growth in revenues received from MVPDs and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network, as well as incremental television license fees driven by first-cycle domestic syndication availabilities of television series in 2013 (see page I-3 for more information about television syndication cycles). Advertising revenues in 2013 will benefit from the Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network. However, the Company's overall financial performance will be impacted by many factors, including, the health of the economy and audience acceptance of the Company's programming.  

 The Company generated $1.82 billion of operating cash flow in 2012 which was primarily used to return $1.41 billion to shareholders through repurchases of the Company's stock and payment of dividends, and to invest approximately $400 million back into the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions.

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Free cash flow for 2012 of $1.57 billion, decreased 1% from $1.59 billion for 2011, principally reflecting higher income tax payments and increased investment in television content. Included in free cash flow for 2012 were contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans of $200 million and payments of approximately $60 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for make-whole premiums. Free cash flow for 2011 included contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans of $410 million. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information" on pages II-12 and II-13 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), to free cash flow.  

 As part of the Company's strategic initiatives for its outdoor advertising business, the Company has begun the process of converting its outdoor business in the Americas into a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company initiated a plan to divest its outdoor advertising business in Europe, which includes an interest in an outdoor business in Asia ("Outdoor Europe"). Outdoor Europe has been classified as held-for-sale and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. All of these actions are subject to customary approvals.  

CBS Corp. operates in the following five segments:  

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group, CBS Films and  CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 55% to consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010 and 46%, 47% and 37% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 13%, 12% and 11% to consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 26% to consolidated operating income in 2012 and 2011, and 28% to consolidated operating income in 2010.  

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as  Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Free Press. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 6% to consolidated revenues and 3% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010.  

LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales. The Local Broadcasting segment contributed 20% to consolidated revenues in 2012 and 2011, and 21% to consolidated revenues in 2010 and 28%, 29% and 38% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  

OUTDOOR AMERICAS: The Outdoor Americas segment, principally through CBS Outdoor, provides space for advertisers on various structures in North America and South America, including billboards, transit shelters and benches, buses, rail systems (both in-car and structures on station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage, and in retail stores. Outdoor Americas revenues are generated primarily from advertising displayed on such structures. The Outdoor Americas segment contributed 9% to consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, and 7%, 8% and 7% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 Consolidated Results of Operations2012 vs. 2011 and 2011 vs. 2010  

 Revenues  

 The following tables present the Company's consolidated revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Advertising sales increased 1% to $8.46 billion in 2012 from $8.40 billion in 2011 reflecting increased political advertising spending associated with the U.S. presidential election, as well as a steady advertising marketplace. Network advertising revenues increased slightly reflecting higher pricing, partially offset by lower ratings during the second half of 2012. Advertising revenues in 2013 will benefit from the CBS Television Network's broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network once every three years, as well as upfront pricing increases for the remainder of the 2012/2013 television broadcast season. However, overall advertising revenues for the CBS Television Network will also be impacted by ratings for its programming and demand in the scatter advertising market (see page I-2 for a description of advertising sales in the upfront and scatter markets). Also in 2013, advertising revenue comparisons for Local Broadcasting will be negatively impacted by lower political advertising spending.  

 In 2011, advertising sales decreased 2% to $8.40 billion from $8.56 billion in 2010 as comparability for 2011 was impacted by the 2010 broadcast of  Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and the new programming agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. for the telecast of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship ("NCAA Tournament"), which began in 2011. In aggregate, these two non-comparable items negatively impacted the advertising revenue comparison for 2011 by four percentage points. Underlying advertising revenues for 2011 benefited from pricing increases for sports programming, growth in network primetime and higher outdoor advertising sales, partially offset by significantly lower political spending as 2010 benefited from midterm elections.  

 Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced programming to multiple media platforms and in various geographic locations; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 7% to $3.47 billion in 2012 from $3.24 billion in 2011 reflecting higher revenues from the licensing of programming for digital streaming  

II-6 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

and increased domestic and international syndication sales. In 2011, content licensing and distribution revenues increased 6% to $3.24 billion from $3.05 billion in 2010 reflecting growth in both domestic and international television license fees, principally driven by the impact of new licensing agreements for digital streaming.  

 Content licensing and distribution revenues are expected to grow in 2013, reflecting the benefit from first-cycle domestic syndication availabilities (see page I-3 for more information about television syndication cycles). Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available for exhibition, and accordingly, substantial fluctuations in operating results may result from the timing of the availability of a television series for a multiple year licensing arrangement.  

 Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs for carriage of the Company's cable networks, as well as for authorizing the MVPDs carriage of the Company's owned television stations ("retransmission fees"); fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (known as "network affiliation fees" or "reverse compensation"); and subscriber fees for online content. Growth in each of these components resulted in increases in affiliate and subscription fees of 9% in both 2012 and 2011 to $1.92 billion and $1.76 billion, respectively. The Company expects continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues in 2013, reflecting the benefit of current agreements, as well as the renewal of certain other agreements with MVPDs and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network.  

 Other revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor Americas operations, remained relatively flat for all periods presented.  

 International Revenues  

 International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues, as well as outdoor advertising revenues generated in Canada, Mexico and South America. The Company generated approximately 12% of its total revenues from international regions in both 2012 and 2011, and 11% in 2010.

 Operating Expenses  

 The table below presents the Company's consolidated operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Programming expenses represented 33% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2012 and 2011, and 36% in 2010, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses increased 2% to $2.62 billion in 2012 from $2.56 billion in 2011 primarily driven by higher television programming costs, principally for network primetime programming. The Company expects programming expenses to be higher in 2013, principally driven by the amortization of sports programming costs relating to the CBS Television Network's broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network once every three years. For 2011, programming expenses decreased 17% to $2.56 billion from $3.09 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting lower costs for sports programming, including the impact of the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament, which began in 2011, and the absence of the 2010 broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network, as well as lower acquired television series costs.  

 Production expenses represented 27% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2012 and 2011, and 25% in 2010, and reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses increased 3% to $2.15 billion in 2012 from $2.10 billion in 2011 primarily driven by higher amortization associated with increased revenues from television licensing arrangements. For 2011, production expenses remained relatively flat at $2.10 billion due to the title mix from licensing arrangements for television programming. The Company expects its production costs to increase in 2013 mainly reflecting cost amortization associated with revenues from first-cycle domestic syndication availabilities.  

 Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses represented 8% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, and reflect lease and franchise costs associated with billboards, transit and other outdoor displays, rent expense on production facilities, and other occupancy costs. Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 1% to $645 million in 2012 from $637 million in 2011, principally due to the negative outcome of a dispute over a billboard tax that has been imposed on the outdoor advertising industry in Toronto, partially offset by lower occupancy expenses from the impact of cost-savings initiatives. For 2011, billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses decreased slightly to $637 million from $640 million in 2010.  

 Participation, distribution and royalty costs, which represented 13% of total operating expenses in 2012, 14% in 2011 and 13% in 2010, primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television and feature film content, such as print and advertising. Participation, distribution and royalty  

II-8 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

costs decreased 6% to $1.00 billion in 2012 from $1.07 billion in 2011, principally due to lower participations associated with the mix of titles licensed for syndication. For 2011, participation, distribution and royalty costs remained relatively flat at $1.07 billion reflecting lower advertising and other distribution costs from the timing of theatrical film releases offset by higher participations from the licensing of titles for digital streaming and the mix of domestic syndication sales.  

 Other operating expenses, which represented 19% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, primarily include compensation, costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing, and costs associated with the production and hosting of websites. For 2012, other operating expenses increased 2% to $1.55 billion from $1.52 billion in 2011 reflecting higher employee-related costs mainly to support growth in digital businesses. For 2011, other operating expenses decreased 5% to $1.52 billion from $1.61 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with the absence of sponsorship revenues resulting from the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2012 and 2011, and 18% for 2010. For 2012, SG&A expenses increased $36 million, or 1%, to $2.63 billion from $2.60 billion in 2011 principally due to a charge related to a Publishing legal settlement, and higher advertising and promotion expenses.  

 For 2011, SG&A expenses increased $132 million, or 5%, to $2.60 billion from $2.47 billion in 2010 principally due to a settlement of $90 million recorded in 2010 related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses, higher advertising and increased selling expenses primarily associated with higher revenues, partially offset by $37 million lower pension and postretirement benefit costs primarily due to the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2010.  

 Restructuring Charges  

 During the year ended December 31, 2012, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $19 million, reflecting $13 million of severance costs and $6 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $43 million and $59 million, respectively. The charges reflected $53 million of severance costs and $49 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2012, the cumulative amount paid for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 restructuring charges was $83 million, of which  

II-9 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

$55 million was for the severance costs and $28 million was related to costs associated with contractual obligations. The Company expects to substantially utilize the remaining reserves by the end of 2013.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Impairment Charges  

 In 2012, in connection with the sale of its five owned radio stations in West Palm Beach, the Company recorded a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $11 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization decreased $20 million, or 4%, to $475 million for 2012 from $495 million for 2011 and decreased $5 million, or 1%, to $495 million for 2011 from $500 million for 2010, in both cases reflecting lower amortization for leasehold agreements.  

 Interest Expense  

 Interest expense decreased $33 million, or 8%, to $402 million for 2012 from $435 million for 2011, primarily driven by the Company's debt refinancing during 2012. For 2011, interest expense decreased $92 million, or 17%, to $435 million from $527 million for 2010, primarily resulting from the refinancing and reduction of debt during 2010. The Company had $5.92 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 and $5.98 billion at December 31, 2011, at weighted average interest rates of 6.0% and 6.9%, respectively.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income of $6 million for 2012 remained flat compared to 2011 and for 2011, interest income increased from $5 million in 2010.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Net Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

 For 2012, the net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $32 million reflected a pre-tax loss associated with the redemption of the Company's $338 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2012 and $400 million of 8.20% senior notes due 2014, partially offset by the pre-tax gain recognized upon the redemption of the Company's $700 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2056. (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 For 2010, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81 million was associated with the repurchase and redemption of $2.07 billion of the Company's debt, of which $750 million was repurchased through tender offers.  

 Other Items, Net  

 For all periods presented, "Other items, net" primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2010, "Other items, net" also included gains of $21 million associated with dispositions.  

 Provision for Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2012, the provision for income taxes increased to $892 million from $751 million in 2011 and for 2011, the provision for income taxes increased from $478 million in 2010. These increases were primarily driven by the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. The Company's effective income tax rate was 35% in 2012, 34% in 2011 and 36% in 2010. For 2013, the Company's annual effective tax rate is expected to be comparable to the prior three years.  

 Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  

 Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $35 million for 2012, $37 million for 2011 and $35 million for 2010 reflecting the Company's share of the operating results of its equity investments.  

 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations  

 The Company reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.63 billion for 2012, $1.39 billion for 2011 and $822 million for 2010.  

 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations  

 As part of the Company's strategic initiatives for its outdoor advertising business, during the fourth quarter of 2012 the Company initiated a plan to divest Outdoor Europe. Outdoor Europe is expected to be sold within one year. As a result, Outdoor Europe has been classified as held-for-sale and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.  

II-11 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The following table sets forth details of the net loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In constant dollars, revenues from discontinued operations for 2012 increased 1% compared to 2011 and for 2011 revenues in constant dollars decreased 2% compared to 2010.  

 Net Earnings and Diluted EPS  

 For 2012, net earnings were $1.57 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, up from $1.31 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share in 2011 and for 2011, net earnings increased from $724 million, or $1.04 per diluted share in 2010. These increases were principally driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense. The increase in diluted EPS also reflected lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company's share repurchase program.  

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  

 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and less capital expenditures. The Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations. The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

 Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry.  

II-12 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.  

 The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Segment Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010  

 The following tables present the Company's revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA"), operating income (loss) and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company presents Segment OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA to the Company's consolidated Net earnings (loss) is presented in Note 15 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.  

 Outdoor Europe, previously included in the Outdoor segment, has been presented as a discontinued operation. As a result, the Outdoor segment has been renamed Outdoor Americas. In addition, Residual

 Entertainment (CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group, CBS Films and CBS Interactive) 

 (Contributed 55% to consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, and 46%, 47% and 37% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Entertainment revenues increased 3% to $7.69 billion from $7.46 billion in 2011. This growth was led by a 13% increase in revenues from the licensing of television programming, driven by higher licensing revenues from digital streaming as well as domestic and international syndication. Revenue growth also reflects higher network affiliation fees. Advertising revenues increased slightly, reflecting higher pricing partially offset by lower primetime ratings during the second half of 2012. Revenue comparisons in 2013 will benefit from the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVII on the CBS Television Network, first-cycle domestic syndication availabilities, and incremental network affiliation fees associated with current agreements and expected renewals in 2013.  

 For 2012, Entertainment OIBDA increased $118 million, or 8%, to $1.55 billion from $1.43 billion for 2011, principally driven by the aforementioned revenue growth and higher profit margins on television licensing revenues. Restructuring charges of $7 million in 2012 principally reflect severance costs. For 2011, restructuring charges of $40 million principally reflect costs associated with exiting operating facilities and severance costs.  

 Fees for television programming licensed for syndication and digital streaming are recorded as revenues at the beginning of the license period in which the programs are made available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $1.31 billion and $1.25 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

 2011 vs. 2010  

 For 2011, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $7.46 billion from $7.39 billion in 2010. This growth was led by 10% higher revenues from domestic and international television license fees, driven by licensing agreements for digital streaming. Revenue growth also reflected higher network affiliation fees and underlying advertising revenue increases from higher pricing for the broadcast of sporting events and higher primetime advertising for the CBS Television Network. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network as well as the impact of  

II-15 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament, which resulted in lower revenues, but higher profits for 2011 compared to 2010.  

 For 2011, Entertainment OIBDA increased $537 million, or 60%, to $1.43 billion from $894 million for 2010 with an improved OIBDA margin of seven percentage points to 19%. The OIBDA increase and margin improvement reflect the aforementioned revenue growth, significantly lower sports programming costs resulting from the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament and the absence of the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network, as well as cost decreases associated with the timing of production and distribution expenses. Restructuring charges of $23 million for 2010 principally reflected severance costs.

 (Contributed 13%, 12% and 11% to consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 26% to consolidated operating income in 2012 and 2011, and 28% to consolidated operating income in 2010.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Cable Networks revenues increased 9% to $1.77 billion from $1.62 billion in 2011 primarily driven by higher affiliate fees, which reflect increases in rates and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, as well as higher licensing revenues from the digital streaming and international syndication of Showtime original series. As of December 31, 2012 subscriptions totaled 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and  Flix), 46 million for CBS Sports Network and 17 million for Smithsonian Networks.  

 For 2012, Cable Networks OIBDA increased $104 million, or 15%, to $811 million from $707 million for 2011, primarily due to the aforementioned revenue growth and 12% lower costs for theatrical programming, partially offset by 14% higher programming and production costs associated with Showtime original series and sports programming.  

 2011 vs. 2010  

 For 2011, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $1.62 billion from $1.48 billion in 2010 primarily driven by 7% higher affiliate fees reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, as well as higher licensing revenues from international syndication, digital streaming and home entertainment sales of Showtime original series. As

of December 31, 2011 subscriptions totaled 73 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 44 million for CBS Sports Network, and 12 million for Smithsonian Networks.  

 For 2011, Cable Networks OIBDA increased $138 million, or 24%, to $707 million from $569 million for 2010, primarily due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower costs for theatrical programming, partially offset by higher programming and advertising costs for Showtime original series. Restructuring charges of $3 million for 2010 principally reflect costs associated with exiting an operating facility.  

 Publishing (Simon & Schuster)  

 (Contributed 6% to consolidated revenues and 3% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Publishing revenues of $790 million remained relatively flat compared to $787 million in 2011, reflecting growth in digital book sales and lower print book sales. Revenues from digital sales increased 35% from the same prior-year period and represented 23% of total Publishing revenues in 2012 compared to 17% in 2011. Best-selling titles in 2012 included Kill Shot by Vince Flynn and The Wind Through the Keyhole by Stephen King.  

 For 2012, Publishing OIBDA decreased $3 million, or 3%, to $89 million from $92 million for 2011. The decrease was driven by a charge related to a settlement agreement to resolve the e-books antitrust action covering a number of states, the District of Columbia and United States territories. Underlying Publishing results reflect margin growth associated with an increase in the mix of revenues from digital book sales, which have lower production and distribution costs than print books. As the Publishing business continues to transition to an increasing mix of digital book sales compared to print book sales, profit margins are expected to continue to grow. Restructuring charges of $3 million in 2012 primarily reflected costs associated with combining several of Publishing's imprints. Restructuring charges of $2 million in 2011 reflected severance costs.  

 2011 vs. 2010  

 For 2011, Publishing revenues decreased 1% to $787 million from $791 million in 2010 as strong growth in digital book sales was offset by lower print book sales. Revenues from digital book sales of $133 million for 2011 more than doubled 2010 digital book sales and represented 17% of total Publishing revenues in 2011. Best-selling titles in 2011 included Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson and 11/22/63 by Stephen King.  

II-17 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 For 2011, Publishing OIBDA increased $20 million, or 28%, to $92 million from $72 million for 2010 driven by lower direct operating costs, including expense decreases resulting from the significant increase in more profitable digital book sales as a percentage of total revenues, lower bad debt expenses and the impact of cost-containment measures. Restructuring charges of $4 million in 2010 reflected severance costs.  

 Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio)  

 (Contributed 20% to consolidated revenues in 2012 and 2011, and 21% to consolidated revenues in 2010 and 28%, 29% and 38% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Local Broadcasting revenues increased 3% to $2.77 billion from $2.69 billion for 2011 principally reflecting higher political advertising and retransmission fees partially offset by softness in local economies. CBS Television Stations revenues increased 8% from the prior year, while CBS Radio revenues decreased 2%.  

 Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased 13% to $957 million from $849 million for 2011, primarily driven by the revenue growth, lower programming costs for syndicated programming, and lower music royalty costs. During 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $11 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill in connection with the disposition of the Company's radio stations in West Palm Beach. Restructuring charges of $8 million for 2012 reflect severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations.  

 2011 vs. 2010  

 For 2011, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 3% to $2.69 billion from $2.78 billion for 2010 principally driven by lower political advertising sales. CBS Television Stations revenues decreased 7% due to the difficult comparison to 2010, which included significant political advertising for midterm elections and revenues from the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast. Comparability was also impacted by lost revenues resulting from the National Basketball Association lockout during 2011. CBS Television Stations results reflected growth in many key advertising categories, including domestic automotive and financial services, as well as higher retransmission fees. CBS Radio revenues increased slightly from the prior year, despite lower political advertising spending, reflecting growth in domestic auto, financial services and retail advertising.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 For 2011, Local Broadcasting OIBDA decreased 2% to $849 million from $865 million for 2010 primarily due to the revenue decline, partially offset by lower programming and production costs for syndicated and sports programming. Restructuring charges of $25 million for 2010 reflect severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations.  

 Acquisitions and Dispositions  

 During 2012, the Company acquired a radio station in the New York market and a radio station in the Washington, D.C. area, as well as a television station in Long Island, New York. Also during 2012, the Company sold five radio stations in West Palm Beach. Together, these acquisitions and dispositions did not have a material impact on the comparability of operating results.  

 Outdoor Americas (CBS Outdoor) 

 (Contributed 9% to consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, and 7%, 8% and 7% to consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2012 vs. 2011  

 For 2012, Outdoor Americas revenues increased 1% on both a reported and constant dollar basis to $1.30 billion from $1.29 billion in 2011, principally driven by 5% growth in the U.S. reflecting increases in both the billboards and displays businesses. The nonrenewal of the Toronto transit contract negatively affected the revenue comparison by two percentage points. Approximately 14% and 18% of Outdoor Americas revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2012 and 2011, respectively.  

 For 2012, Outdoor Americas OIBDA decreased 1% to $378 million from $380 million in 2011, as the revenue growth was offset by the negative outcome of a dispute over a billboard tax that has been imposed on the outdoor advertising industry in Toronto, including a one-time retroactive payment. Outdoor Americas depreciation and amortization decreased in all periods presented principally reflecting lower amortization for leasehold agreements.  

 The Company has begun the process of converting Outdoor Americas into a REIT. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company initiated a plan to divest Outdoor Europe. Outdoor Europe has been classified as held-for-sale and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.  

 2011 vs. 2010  

 For 2011, Outdoor Americas revenues increased 5% to $1.29 billion from $1.23 billion in 2010 principally driven by 5% growth in the U.S. reflecting increases in both the billboards and displays  

II-19 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

businesses. The revenue increase was also due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of approximately $7 million. In constant dollars, Outdoor Americas revenues increased 4%. Approximately 18% of Outdoor Americas revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for both 2011 and 2010.  

 For 2011, Outdoor Americas OIBDA increased 20% to $380 million from $317 million in 2010 and the OIBDA margin increased to 30% for 2011 from 26% for 2010. These increases were primarily driven by the revenue growth and the mix of more profitable contracts. Restructuring charges of $4 million for 2010 principally reflect severance costs.  

 Corporate  

 Corporate expenses include general corporate overhead, unallocated shared company expenses, pension and postretirement benefit costs for plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses, and intercompany eliminations. For 2012, corporate expenses decreased 2% to $320 million from $326 million for 2011 driven by lower pension and postretirement benefit costs, primarily due to the benefit from pre-funding pension plans in 2011 and lower pension-related interest cost associated with retirees. This decrease was partially offset by expense increases associated with the Company's higher stock price.  

 For 2011, corporate expenses increased to $326 million from $250 million for 2010 primarily reflecting the absence of the 2010 favorable settlement of $90 million related to the resolution of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit costs. The decrease in pension and postretirement benefit costs was primarily due to the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2010, as well as the benefit from pre-funding pension plans in 2010.  

 Financial Position  

 Current assets increased by $171 million to $5.72 billion at December 31, 2012 from $5.55 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily due to increases in entertainment and sports programming rights. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 2.5% at December 31, 2012 compared with 3.1% at December 31, 2011, primarily due to recoveries and write-offs of previously reserved receivables.  

 Net property and equipment of $2.27 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased by $101 million from $2.37 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $369 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $254 million.  

 Other assets increased by $142 million to $1.55 billion at December 31, 2012 from $1.41 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting higher long-term receivables associated with revenues from licensing agreements for digital streaming.  

 Pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased by $30 million to $1.86 billion at December 31, 2012 from $1.83 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting actuarial losses resulting from the decrease in the discount rate, offset by contributions made to the Company's qualified pension plans and better than expected asset performance.  

 Other liabilities decreased $209 million to $2.16 billion at December 31, 2012 from $2.37 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily driven by lower programming liabilities and residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses.

 Cash Flows  

 Cash and cash equivalents increased by $48 million and $180 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and decreased by $237 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Activities. In 2012, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $13 million to $1.82 billion from $1.83 billion in 2011 as the increase in operating income was more than offset by higher income tax payments and a higher use of cash from working capital. The increased use of working capital primarily reflects a higher level of investment in television content in 2012, and higher receivables from the timing difference between revenue recognition and collections for long term television licensing arrangements, primarily for digital streaming. Revenues from the licensing of television programming are recognized when the television series is made available to the licensee, at the beginning of the applicable license period, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. The Company made pension contributions to its qualified plans of $200 million in 2012 compared with $410 million in 2011. Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for 2012 also included payments of approximately $60 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for make-whole premiums.  

 In 2011, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $63 million to $1.83 billion from $1.77 billion in 2010 principally driven by growth in operating income and lower interest payments, partially offset by lower contributions from changes in working capital, which reflected a use of cash during 2011 versus a source of cash during 2010. The working capital change reflected higher contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans in 2011 of $410 million compared to $167 million in 2010; the benefit to 2010 cash flow from the telecast of the Super Bowl in that year; and the timing difference between revenue recognition and collections for the Company's multi-year digital streaming agreements which were first signed in 2011.  

 Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations was $425 million for 2012, $233 million for 2011 and $245 million for 2010. The increase in cash taxes for 2012 was driven by the increase in pre-tax income and lower tax benefits from lower contributions to the Company's qualified pension plans. The decrease in cash taxes for 2011 was driven by tax benefits from contributions to the Company's qualified  

II-21 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

pension plans and higher market values for stock-based compensation instruments exercised and vested, partially offset by higher tax payments associated with an increase in taxable income.  

 Investing Activities. In 2012, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $429 million principally includes capital expenditures of $254 million; acquisitions of $146 million, primarily for television and radio stations; and investments of $91 million, primarily in domestic and international television joint ventures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $49 million received for dispositions, principally from the sale of radio stations. In 2011, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $369 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $245 million; investments of $79 million, principally in domestic and international television ventures; and acquisitions of $75 million, primarily for internet businesses. In 2010, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $328 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $254 million and investments of $80 million, principally in domestic and international television ventures.  

 Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $254 million in 2012, $245 million in 2011 and $254 million in 2010. For 2013, capital expenditures are anticipated to be at similar levels as the prior three years.  

 Financing Activities. In 2012, cash used for financing activities of $1.32 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.58 billion, the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.14 billion, dividend payments of $276 million and the payment of employee payroll taxes in lieu of issuing shares for restricted stock unit vests of $105 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.57 billion and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $168 million. For 2011, cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion principally reflected the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.01 billion and dividend payments of $206 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $72 million. In 2010, cash used for financing activities of $1.60 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $2.13 billion, a $400 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the account receivable securitization program and dividend payments of $142 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.09 billion.  

 Dividends  

 On January 29, 2013, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.12 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2013. The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2012, 2011 and 2010, resulting in total annual dividends of $287 million, $237 million and $139 million, respectively. During 2012, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend from $.10 per share to $.12 per share, beginning with the dividend declared in the third quarter.  

 Share Repurchase Program  

 During 2012, the Company repurchased 35.5 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.17 billion, at an average cost of $32.99 per share. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in January 2011 through December 31, 2012, the Company has repurchased 77.7 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $2.19 billion, at an average cost of $28.18 per share, leaving $2.51 billion of authorization remaining at December 31, 2012.  

 On February 14, 2013, the Company announced its intention to accelerate its current share repurchase program by repurchasing an additional $1 billion of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock through an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") transaction. The Company expects to initiate the ASR during the first quarter of 2013.

 Capital Structure  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized (discount) premium of $(16) million and $4 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $23 million and $75 million, respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $5.93 billion at December 31, 2012 and $5.92 billion at December 31, 2011. 

(b)Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

 Total debt of $5.94 billion at December 31, 2012 and $6.00 billion at December 31, 2011 was 37% and 38%, respectively, of the total capitalization of the Company.  

 The senior debt of CBS Corp., is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52 million of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., has no guarantor.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2012, debt issuances and redemptions were as follows:  

 Debt Issuances   

June 2012, $400 million 1.95% senior notes due 2017

 June 2012, $500 million 4.85% senior notes due 2042

 February 2012, $700 million 3.375% senior notes due 2022   

 Debt Redemptions   

$152 million 8.625% debentures due 2012

 $338 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012

 $400 million 8.20% senior notes due 2014

 $700 million 6.75% senior notes due 2056   

 These redemptions resulted in a pre-tax net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.  

 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company issued $1.10 billion of senior notes and repurchased and redeemed $2.07 billion of senior notes and debentures, of which $750 million was repurchased through tender offers, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81 million.  

 At December 31, 2012, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

II-23 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Credit Facility  

 At December 31, 2012, the Company had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in March 2015 (the "Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.  

 The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0x at the end of each quarter and a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 3.0x for the trailing four quarters, each as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2012, the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 1.6x and Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 9.5x.  

 The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company's indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company's Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash items. The Consolidated Coverage Ratio reflects the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's cash interest expense on indebtedness, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, in each case for the trailing four consecutive quarters.  

 The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2012, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.99 billion.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company's operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, franchise payments, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company's investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $1.99 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2012, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.  

 The Company's funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs.  

 Funding for the Company's long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $699 million is expected to come from cash generated from operating activities and the Company's ability to refinance its debt.  

II-24 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 On February 14, 2013, the Company announced its intention to accelerate its current share repurchase program by repurchasing an additional $1 billion of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock through an ASR transaction. The Company expects to initiate the ASR during the first quarter of 2013 and finance it primarily with short-term borrowings, cash on hand and cash generated from operations. The Company expects to repay the short-term borrowings during 2013 using cash generated from operations and proceeds from potential dispositions.  

 Contractual Obligations  

 As of December 31, 2012 the Company's significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $11.98 billion for sports programming rights, $2.44 billion relating to television, radio, and film production and licensing and $789 million for talent contracts. 

(b)Outdoor Americas has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 

(c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. 

(d)Consists of long-term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. Total future minimum payments of $1.97 billion include $707 million for Outdoor Americas billboards. 

(e)Long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. 

(f)Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt and excluding capital leases. 

(g)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. 

(h)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders. 

(i)Does not include contractual obligations of Outdoor Europe, which is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements. These obligations are mainly comprised of guaranteed minimum franchise payments of $565 million and long-term operating lease commitments of $166 million.   

II-25 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The table above also excludes $173 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation.  

 In 2013, the Company expects to make discretionary contributions of $150 million to pre-fund its qualified pension plans and contributions of approximately $51 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2013, the Company expects to contribute approximately $67 million to its other postretirement benefit plans, to satisfy the Company's portion of benefit payments due under these plans.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2012, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $426 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 Prior to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005, former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to obligations related to Famous Players theater leases. In connection with the separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the separation agreement between the parties.  

 In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.  

 The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Programming and Production Costs  

 Accounting for television and theatrical film production costs requires management's judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned ("Ultimate Revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program or theatrical film, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs or theatrical films.  

 The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program.  

 Ultimate Revenues estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program and theatrical film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.  

 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test.  

 GoodwillGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. For 2012, in accordance with amended FASB guidance for goodwill impairment testing, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for seven reporting units which management estimates each have fair values that exceed their respective carrying values by 20% or more. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units. Based on this qualitative assessment, considering the aggregation of these factors, the Company concluded that for these seven reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and therefore performing the two-step impairment test was unnecessary.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 The Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the remaining two reporting units. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows ("Discounted Cash Flow Method") and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses ("Market Comparable Method"). For 2012, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company's internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market or a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any noncash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Balance Sheet.  

 Based on the 2012 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the fair value of each of the two reporting units for which the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test exceeded their respective carrying values. The percentage that fair value exceeded carrying value and the significant assumptions used to calculate the fair value for these reporting units were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 At December 31, 2012 the carrying value of goodwill for the CBS Interactive and CBS Radio reporting units was $993 million and $1.86 billion, respectively. An increase to the discount rates of 60 basis points and 40 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rates of 110 basis points and 50 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values.  

 FCC LicensesFCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company's radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use.  

 For its annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance which permits the Company to choose to first assess qualitative factors to  

II-28 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If based on this assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. For 2012, the Company performed this qualitative assessment for ten radio markets and eleven television markets which management estimates each have an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that exceed their respective carrying values by 20% or more. For each market, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on this qualitative assessment, considering the aggregation of these factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the aggregate fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these radio and television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.  

 For each of the remaining radio and television markets the Company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up station, the total market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry.  

 The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2012 were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The assumptions used in determining fair values of the FCC licenses require management to make significant judgments. Certain events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital or a decline in the local radio or television advertising markets, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television and radio stations. Deterioration in the economic conditions or a change in population size of any individual geographic market could adversely impact  

II-29 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

advertisers' ability or willingness to purchase advertising on the radio and television stations in that market. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain industries, including automotive, entertainment and retail, have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues in all geographic markets. As a result, an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in these categories or adverse economic conditions, particularly in larger markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, where the Company holds FCC licenses with substantial carrying values, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the FCC licenses.  

 Based on the 2012 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses in each radio and television market for which the Company performed the quantitative assessment exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. Four radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $316 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and four radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $838 million, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. In each of the remaining radio markets and in all of the television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values at December 31, 2012 by more than 10%. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 Reserves and Legal Matters  

 Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.  

 Pensions  

 Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet each of the Company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2012, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased from the prior year end due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate as well as changes in other actuarial assumptions. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $110 million and will not have a material impact on the 2013 pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $10 million in 2013 pension expense.

 Income Taxes  

 The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized tax benefits of $3 million and $6 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $173 million at December 31, 2012 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.  

 Legal Matters  

 E-books Matters. A number of lawsuits described below have been pending against the following parties relating to the sale of e-books: Apple Inc., Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers, LLC, Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC d/b/a Macmillan, Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and the Company's subsidiary, Simon & Schuster, Inc. (collectively, the "Publishing parties").  

 On April 10, 2012, for purposes of settlement and without any admission of wrongdoing or liability, Simon & Schuster and two of the other Publishing parties entered into a settlement stipulation and proposed final judgment (the "Stipulation") with the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") in connection with the DOJ's investigations of agency distribution of e-books. In furtherance of this settlement, on April 11, 2012, the DOJ filed an antitrust action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Publishing parties and concurrently filed the Stipulation with the court. On September 7, 2012, the Stipulation was approved by the court and final judgment was entered. The Stipulation does not involve any monetary payments by Simon & Schuster, but will require the adoption of certain business practices for a 24 month period and certain compliance practices for a five year period.  

 On June 11, 2012, for purposes of settlement and without any admission of wrongdoing or liability, Simon & Schuster entered into a proposed settlement agreement to resolve the antitrust action filed by a number of states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico against several of the Publishing parties in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, which was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ("States") on April 30, 2012. The proposed settlement provides that, certain Publishing parties, including Simon & Schuster, will pay agreed upon amounts for consumer restitution, among other things, and also requires the adoption of certain business and compliance practices, which are substantially similar to those described in the Stipulation with the DOJ. On September 14, 2012, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement, which all

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

states (except Minnesota), the District of Columbia and the United States territories joined. On October 15, 2012, Simon & Schuster paid the agreed upon amounts into an escrow account pending final court approval. On February 8, 2013, the court approved the proposed settlement following a final settlement approval hearing that day. The Company believes that this settlement with the States and the Stipulation with the DOJ will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 On December 9, 2011, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "MDL") issued an order consolidating in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York various purported class action suits that private litigants had filed in federal courts in California and New York. On January 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the court against the Publishing parties. These private litigant plaintiffs, who are e-book purchasers, allege that, among other things, the defendants are in violation of federal and/or state antitrust laws in connection with the sale of e-books pursuant to agency distribution arrangements between each of the publishers and e-book retailers. The consolidated amended class action complaint generally seeks multiple forms of damages for the purchase of e-books and injunctive and other relief. On March 2, 2012, the Publishing parties filed a motion to dismiss this action. On May 15, 2012, the court denied the motion to dismiss. The Company believes that the States' settlement will likely resolve the class claims of those private litigant plaintiffs in the MDL litigation who reside in the areas covered by the States' settlement and who do not opt out of such settlement.  

 Commencing on February 24, 2012, similar antitrust suits have been filed under Canadian law against the Publishing parties by private litigants in Canada, purportedly as class actions. Simon & Schuster intends to vigorously defend itself in the MDL and Canadian matters.  

 In addition, the European Commission (the "EC") and Canadian Competition Bureau are conducting separate competition investigations of agency distribution arrangements of e-books in this industry and Simon & Schuster is cooperating with these investigations. On September 19, 2012, the EC began accepting public comment on the terms of a proposed settlement. On December 12, 2012, following the close of that comment period, the EC accepted the proposed settlement. The settlement between the EC and certain Publishing parties, including Simon & Schuster, requires the adoption of certain business and compliance practices similar to those described in the Stipulation with the DOJ.  

 Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos-containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships.  

 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had pending approximately 45,900 asbestos claims, as compared with  

II-32 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

approximately 50,090 as of December 31, 2011 and 52,220 as of December 31, 2010. During 2012, the Company received approximately 4,350 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 8,540 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2012 and 2011 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $21 million and $33 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.  

 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.  

 Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.  

 General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.  

 Market Risk  

 The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the  

II-33 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.  

 Foreign Exchange Risk  

 The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.  

 At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts were $157 million and $151 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.  

 Credit Risk  

 The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.  

 The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2012 or 2011, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.

 The Company, through the normal course of business, is involved in transactions with other related parties that have not been material in any of the periods presented.  

 Adoption of New Accounting Standards  

 Fair Value Measurements  

 During the first quarter of 2012, the Company adopted the FASB's amended guidance which clarifies the FASB's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and changes certain principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

 Impairment Analysis of Unamortized Film Costs  

 During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company adopted the FASB's amended guidance on impairment assessments of unamortized film costs. This guidance eliminates the presumption that the conditions leading to the write-off of unamortized film costs after the balance sheet date existed as of the balance sheet date. The guidance also eliminates the requirement that fair value measurements used in the impairment analysis include the consideration of subsequent evidence, if such information would not have been considered by market participants at the measurement date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment  

 During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company early adopted the FASB's amended guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Under this guidance, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If based on this assessment, the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.
