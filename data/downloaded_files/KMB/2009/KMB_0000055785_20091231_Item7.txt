       Legal Matters  

       New Accounting Standards  

       Business Outlook  

       Forward-Looking Statements  

Overview of Business  

The Corporation is a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life, with manufacturing facilities in 35 countries and products sold in more than 150 countries. The Corporations products are sold under such well-known brands as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. The Corporation has four reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; K-C Professional & Other; and Health Care. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 8, Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In managing its global business, the Corporations management believes that developing new and improved products, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, managing currency and commodity risks, and responding effectively to current and developing global economic environments are important to the long-term success of the Corporation. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors.  

       Product innovationPast results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. The Corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and/or maintain category leadership. In order to introduce new or improved products, the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed. Research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care, tissue, industrial wipers, safety and health care products and nonwoven materials.  

       Competitive environmentPast results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely-advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which  

15  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities.  

The Corporation increased promotional and strategic marketing spending in 2008 and 2009 to support new product introductions, further build brand equity and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the Corporations products in the market. We expect competition to continue to be intense in 2010.  

       Market sharesAchieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance. We hold number 1 or 2 share positions in more than 80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands.  

       Cost controlsTo maintain or improve our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste, and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in our business segments. Our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of pulp, oil and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes.  

       Foreign currency and commodity risksAs a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and we are also exposed to changes in commodity prices. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations.  

       Global economic environmentThe Corporations business and financial results continue to be adversely affected by economic uncertainty in the United States and throughout the world and volatility in the global markets. Although it has become more challenging to predict our results in the near-term, we will continue to focus on executing our Global Business Plan strategies for the long-term health of our businesses. 

Overview of 2009 Results  

       Net sales decreased 1.5 percent because of unfavorable currency effects and a decline in sales volumes, partially offset by higher net selling prices.  

       Operating profit increased 10.9 percent, and net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark and diluted earnings per share increased 11.5 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively. The benefits of higher net selling prices, cost savings and deflation in key cost components, were partially offset by unfavorable currency effects, organization optimization severance and related charges, increased pension expense, higher operating costs and increased strategic marketing spending.  

       Cash flow from operations was $3.5 billion, an increase of 38 percent.  

Results of Operations and Related Information  

This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2009 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2009 results to 2008, and 2008 results to 2007.

2009 versus 2008  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Personal care net sales in North America decreased about 1 percent due to a decline in sales volumes of 1 percent and unfavorable currency effects of 1 percent, partially offset by higher net selling prices of more than 1 percent. The higher net selling prices resulted from price increases implemented during 2008, net of 2009 increased promotional activity primarily for Huggies diapers to match competitive actions. The sales volume declines resulted from lower sales of training pants, due to category

 weakness, and modestly lower volumes for Huggies diapers. These declines were partially offset by higher volumes for K-Cs adult incontinence brands, including benefits from innovation of Depend products.  

In Europe, personal care net sales decreased about 10 percent as unfavorable currency effects of 12 percent and decreased net selling prices of 2 percent were partially offset by increased sales volumes of 4 percent. The volume increase was driven by growth of Huggies diapers in Central Europe and in the Corporations four core marketsthe U.K., France, Italy and Spain.  

In K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, net sales increased about 5 percent driven by a more than 11 percent increase in net selling prices and 4 percent increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a 10 percent unfavorable currency effect. The growth in net selling prices was broad-based, with particular strength throughout Latin America and in South Korea, Russia, and South Africa. Unfavorable currency effects were primarily in South Korea, Russia, Australia and Latin America.  

       Consumer tissue net sales in North America decreased 2 percent as an increase in net selling prices of 2 percent was offset by a sales volume decline of about 4 percent. The higher net selling prices were primarily attributable to price increases in all categories implemented during 2008, net of increased promotional activity to match competitive actions. Sales volumes were down low single-digits in facial tissue and double-digits in paper towels, primarily as a result of focusing on improving revenue realization and some consumer trade-down to lower-priced product offerings.  

In Europe, consumer tissue net sales decreased almost 14 percent due to unfavorable currency effects of 11 percent, a decrease in sales volumes of 2 percent and a decrease of net selling prices of 1 percent. The lower sales volumes were primarily because of reduced sales of bathroom tissue due to some consumer trade-down to lower-priced product offerings.  

In K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, consumer tissue net sales decreased 3 percent, as an increase in net selling prices of 7 percent and improvements in product mix of 1 percent were more than offset by unfavorable currency effects of 8 percent and lower sales volumes of 3 percent. The increase in net selling prices resulted from price increases implemented in most markets in 2008, net of current year increased promotional activity. Unfavorable currency effects were primarily attributable to South Korea, Russia, Australia and Latin America.  

       Economic weakness and high unemployment levels in North America and Europe continued to affect K-C Professionals categories in 2009. In North America, sales decreased 4 percent, due to a decrease in sales volumes of 6 percent (which is net of an approximate 4 percent benefit from the acquisition of Jackson in April 2009), partially offset by higher net selling prices of about 3 percent. In Europe, sales of K-C Professional products decreased 16 percent, due to a decrease in sales volumes of 9 percent (which is net of an approximate 1 percent benefit from the Jackson acquisition) and unfavorable currency effects of 9 percent, partially offset by higher net selling prices of 3 percent.  

       The increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to broad-based growth across several categories including exam gloves and apparel and a 2 percent benefit from the acquisition of I-Flow in late November 2009. In addition, approximately 35 percent of the total gain in health care volume for the year was attributable to increased global demand for face masks, a result of the H1N1 influenza virus.

Commentary:  

2008 versus 2007  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Personal care net sales in North America increased about 5 percent due to more than 3 percent higher net selling prices and more than 1 percent higher sales volumes. The higher net selling prices resulted from increases implemented throughout 2008, net of increased promotional activity primarily for Huggies diapers to match competitive actions. Sales volume growth was dampened by the effects of the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 as customers adjusted inventory levels, child care category sales slowed and some consumers traded down to lower-priced product offerings.  

In Europe, personal care net sales were even with the prior year as favorable currency effects offset lower sales volumes and net selling prices. Sales volumes of Huggies diapers in the Corporations four core marketsthe U.K., France, Italy and Spaindeclined about 4 percent from the prior year.  

In K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, net sales increased almost 17 percent driven by a more than 10 percent increase in sales volumes. The growth in sales volumes was broad-based, with particular strength throughout Latin America and in South Korea, Russia, Turkey and China. Increased net selling prices and favorable product mix added about 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively, to the net sales increase. Unfavorable currency effects in South Korea were offset by favorable effects in other countries, primarily in Brazil and Israel.  

       Consumer tissue net sales in North America were even with the prior year as increased net selling prices of more than 6 percent and improved product mix of nearly 1 percent were offset by a sales volume decline of about 7 percent. The higher net selling prices were primarily attributable to price increases for bathroom tissue and paper towels implemented during the first and third quarters in the U.S. List prices for facial tissue were raised late in the third quarter. Sales volumes were down mid-single digits in bathroom tissue and facial tissue and double-digits in paper towels, primarily as a result of focusing on improving revenue realization. A portion of the overall volume decline is also due to the Corporations decision in late 2007 to shed certain low-margin private label business.  

In Europe, consumer tissue net sales increased almost 4 percent on nearly 3 percent higher net selling prices, a 1 percent improvement in product mix and more than 2 percent favorable currency effects, tempered by a decline in sales volumes of about 2 percent. The lower sales volumes were primarily due to reduced sales of Andrex and Scottex bathroom tissue and Kleenex facial tissue in response to higher net selling prices and a slowdown in category sales, particularly in the U.K.  

Consumer tissue net sales in K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa increased nearly 13 percent. During 2008, the Corporation raised prices in most markets to recover higher raw materials costs and drove improvements in mix with more differentiated, value-added products, strategies that resulted in higher net selling prices of about 10 percent and better product mix of more than 2 percent. Sales volumes were even with last year. For the year, currency effects were neutral as favorable effects earlier in the year were offset by the dramatic changes in currency rates in the fourth quarter of 2008.

       Economic weakness and rising unemployment levels in North America and Europe began to affect K-C Professionals categories in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, net sales in North America increased nearly 3 percent as increased net selling prices of about 4 percent and improved product mix of over 1 percent were tempered by lower sales volumes. In Europe, net sales of K-C Professional products advanced about 9 percent as increased net selling prices and higher sales volumes contributed nearly 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, to the improvement. Currency effects were about 4 percent favorable versus the prior year.  

       The increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to mid-single digit growth outside North America and a similar advance for medical devices in North America. The price decline was mainly attributable to competitive conditions affecting surgical supplies in North America and Europe.

 (a) Includes raw materials deflation and energy and distribution variations.  

 (b) Includes organization optimization severance and related charges and cost savings.  

 (c) Strategic cost reduction charges of $60 million were included in 2008.  

Consolidated operating profit increased $278 million or 10.9 percent from the prior year. The benefits of higher net selling prices, cost savings of about $240 million and deflation in key cost components totaling approximately $675 million, were partially offset by lower sales volumes, negative currency effects of about $355 million, severance and related costs of $128 million, increased pension expense of about $155 million, higher operating costs and increased strategic marketing spending. Operating profit as a percent of net sales increased to 14.8 percent from 13.1 percent last year. Charges in 2008 of $60 million for the strategic cost reductions, discussed later in this MD&A, are not included in the results of the business segments.  

       Operating profit for the personal care segment increased 5.5 percent as higher net selling prices, materials and other cost deflation, and cost savings, were partially offset by organization optimization severance charges, unfavorable currency effects, higher operating costs and increased marketing expense. In North America, operating profit increased due to higher net selling prices, materials and other cost deflation, and cost savings, tempered by organization optimization severance charges and increased marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit declined as increased sales volumes were more than offset by lower net selling prices and organization optimization severance charges. Operating profit in K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa increased as higher net selling prices and the benefits of volume growth were only partially offset by unfavorable currency effects.  

       Consumer tissue segment operating profit increased 22.5 percent. Materials and other cost deflation, higher net selling prices and cost savings were partially offset by lower sales volumes, increased selling and marketing spending, organization optimization severance charges and negative impacts of production down-time which occurred earlier in the year, in part to drive inventory reductions. Operating profit in North America increased due to the same factors that affected the overall segment. In Europe, operating profit increased as materials and other cost deflation were only partially offset by unfavorable currency effects, lower net selling prices, and lower sales volumes. Operating profit in K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa increased as higher net selling prices and materials and other cost deflation were partially offset by increased marketing expenses, unfavorable currency effects and lower sales volumes.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products increased 8.4 percent as higher net selling prices and materials and other cost deflation were partially offset by organization optimization

 severance charges, lower sales volumes, negative impacts of production down-time, in part to drive reductions in inventory, increased general expense, partially as a result of the Jackson acquisition, and unfavorable currency effects.  

       Operating profit for the health care segment increased 70.6 percent. The benefit of higher sales volumes, materials cost deflation, manufacturing production efficiencies and cost savings were partially offset by higher selling expenses, as a result of the I-Flow acquisition, and lower net selling prices.  

Organization Optimization Initiative  

In June 2009, the Corporation announced actions to reduce its worldwide salaried workforce by approximately 1,600 positions by the end of 2009. These actions resulted in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $128 million in 2009. Related savings from this initiative were approximately $55 million in 2009. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on costs incurred for the initiative.  

Other income and (expense), net  

Other income and (expense), net for 2009 includes currency transaction losses of $110 million, an increase of $92 million over 2008, partially offset by additional favorable settlements of value-added tax matters in Latin America. Approximately $73 million of the currency transaction losses in 2009 related to operations in Venezuela.

2008 versus 2007  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes higher marketing and general expenses net of the benefit of cost savings achieved.  

 (b) Charges for strategic cost reductions were $47 million lower in 2008 than in 2007.  

Consolidated operating profit decreased $69 million or 2.6 percent from the prior year. Charges for the strategic cost reductions of $60 million for 2008 were $47 million lower than in the prior year. Charges for the strategic cost reductions are not included in the results of the business segments. The effect of higher net sales, primarily due to increased net selling prices, plus approximately $171 million in cost savings, were more than offset by significant inflation in key manufacturing cost inputs of more than $725 million, higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to production downtime, of nearly $100 million, increased strategic marketing spending of about $95 million and higher levels of selling and administrative expenses, mainly to support growth in K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. Operating profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 13.1 percent from 14.3 percent last year.

(Continued)  

       Operating profit for the personal care segment increased 5.6 percent as higher net sales and cost savings more than offset raw materials and other cost inflation. In North America, operating profit increased due to the higher net selling prices and cost savings, tempered by materials and other cost inflation, and increased marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit declined as cost savings were more than offset by the lower net selling prices and materials inflation. Operating profit in K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, increased because the higher net selling prices and sales volumes more than offset increased marketing and general expenses.  

       Consumer tissue segment operating profit decreased 14.4 percent. Increased net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by cost inflation, the lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs, including the effect of planned production downtime. Operating profit in North America decreased due to the same factors that affected the overall segment. In Europe, operating profit declined as higher net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by cost inflation. Operating profit in K-Cs international operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, was even with the prior year as higher net selling prices were offset by cost inflation, and increased marketing and general expenses to support growth in these regions.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products decreased 10.5 percent because higher net selling prices were more than offset by cost inflation for both wastepaper and virgin fiber and other materials and increased manufacturing costs, including higher maintenance spending.  

       Operating profit for the health care segment decreased 26.7 percent. The benefit of higher sales volumes was more than offset by the lower net selling prices and higher manufacturing cost. In addition to cost inflation, the segment absorbed manufacturing-related costs as part of a plan to reduce inventory and also experienced higher costs related to changes in its manufacturing footprint.  

Strategic Cost Reduction Plan  

In July 2005, the Corporation authorized a multi-year plan to further improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North America and Europe. The strategic cost reductions commenced in the third quarter of 2005 and were completed by December 31, 2008. The strategic cost reductions resulted in cumulative charges of $880 million before tax or $610 million after tax. Cumulative savings under the plan were $395 million, including $60 million in 2009 and $110 million in 2008.  

Other income and (expense), net  

Other income and (expense), net for 2008 includes costs for a legal judgment and the refinancing of dealer remarketable securities partially offset by favorable settlement of a value-added tax matter in Latin America. A gain of $16 million for the settlement of litigation related to prior years operations in Latin America is included in 2007. In addition, currency transaction losses included in this line item were about $5 million higher in 2008 than in 2007.  

Additional Income Statement Commentary  

2009 versus 2008  

       Interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates and a lower average level of debt. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt activity.  

       The Corporations effective income tax rate was 29.0 percent for 2009 compared with 27.0 percent for 2008. The increase was primarily due to favorable audit activity in 2008 relating to prior years and currency impacts in Latin America and Asia-Pacific.

(Continued)  

       The Corporations share of net income of equity companies declined by $2 million primarily due to unfavorable currency effects affecting the Corporations investment in Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (KCM). Despite higher selling prices and sales volumes, KCMs U.S. dollar results were negatively affected as the Mexican peso results for 2009 were translated into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates that were 18 percent weaker versus the U.S. dollar in 2009 than in 2008. Also affecting the year-over-year comparisons were currency transaction losses in 2008 on its more than $300 million of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that were refinanced into Mexican peso liabilities in 2009. The currency transaction losses reduced the Corporations share of KCMs net income by approximately $23 million in 2008.  

       Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $29 million primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the Corporations Andean affiliate in January 2009. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.  

       The average number of common shares outstanding declined in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to share repurchases throughout 2008 under the Corporations share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased under the program during 2009.  

2008 versus 2007  

       Interest expense increased due to a higher average level of debt partially offset by lower average interest rates. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt activity.  

       The Corporations effective income tax rate was 27.0 percent for 2008 compared with 23.2 percent for 2007. The increase was primarily due to: (a) the benefits from the synthetic fuel credits utilized in 2007 that were not available in 2008; (b) favorable settlements in 2007 of tax issues related to prior years; and (c) the reversal of valuation allowances in 2007 on deferred tax assets at certain majority-owned subsidiaries in Latin America based on a sustained improvement in the subsidiaries operating results, partially offset by higher foreign tax credit benefits in 2008.  

       The Corporations share of net income of equity companies declined by $4 million primarily due to lower net income at KCM. While KCM had higher net sales, its operating profit and net income were affected by currency transaction losses in the fourth quarter of 2008 on its more than $300 million of U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities as the Mexican peso weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The currency transaction losses reduced the Corporations share of KCMs net income by approximately $23 million for 2008.  

       Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $11 million versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher returns payable on the redeemable preferred securities issued by the Corporations consolidated financing subsidiary.  

       As a result of the Corporations ongoing share repurchase program, including an accelerated share repurchase program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2008 net income by about $.25 per share. This benefit was partially offset by the higher interest expense associated with the July 2007 debt issuances that funded the program.  

       As described in Item 8, Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation had minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships. Pretax losses from participation in these partnerships were reported as nonoperating expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. The partnerships were dissolved in 2008 at no cost to the Corporation. The Corporations income tax provision was reduced by $81 million in 2007, resulting from the income tax credits and tax benefits of these investments. Diluted earnings per share benefited by $.03 in 2007 compared with no benefit in 2008.

 (a) Capital is total debt and redeemable securities of subsidiaries plus stockholders equity.  

Cash Flow Commentary:  

Cash provided by operations increased $965 million primarily due to higher cash earnings and reduced working capital, including reductions in inventories and benefits from payables, partially offset by increased pension plan contributions.  

Contractual Obligations:  

The following table presents the Corporations total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Obligations Commentary:  

       Projected interest payments for variable-rate debt were calculated based on the outstanding principal amounts and prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2009.  

       Returns on redeemable preferred securities reflect required return payments through the next redemption election date by instrument class. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

       The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp, and utilities. Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, management believes exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.  

       The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services the Corporation has negotiated for delivery.

(Continued)  

The Corporation will fund its defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expects to contribute about $240 million to these plans in 2010. This amount is not included in the table.  

The table does not include future payments that the Corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, the Corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from approximately $80 million in 2010 to more than $95 million by 2019.  

Accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.  

Deferred taxes, noncontrolling interests and payments for pension plan benefits are also not included in the table.  

A consolidated financing subsidiary has issued two classes of redeemable preferred securities. The holder of the securities can elect to have the subsidiary redeem the first class in December 2011 and the second class in December 2014 and each seven-year anniversary thereafter. In the event that the holder of the securities does elect to have its preferred securities redeemed at the next respective redemption dates, the Corporation would be required to repay approximately $500 million in 2011 and approximately $500 million in 2014. These amounts have not been included in the table. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these securities.  

Investing Commentary:  

       During 2009, the Corporations capital spending was $848 million.  

       During the first quarter of 2009, the Corporation acquired the remaining approximately 31 percent interest in its Andean region subsidiary, Colombiana Kimberly Colpapel S.A., for $289 million.  

       During the second quarter of 2009, the Corporation acquired Jackson, a privately-held safety products company, for approximately $155 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition is consistent with the Corporations global business plan strategy to accelerate growth of high-margin workplace products sold by its K-C Professional business. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Corporation acquired Baylis pain management business. The Corporations Health Care business has been the exclusive distributor of these pain management products in the U.S. since 2001. Also during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Corporation acquired I-Flow, a healthcare company that develops and markets drug delivery systems and products for post-surgical pain relief and surgical site care, for $262 million, net of cash acquired. The Baylis and I-Flow acquisitions are consistent with the Corporations global business plan strategy to invest in the higher-growth, higher-margin medical device market. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these acquisitions.  

Financing Commentary:   

       At December 31, 2009, total debt and redeemable securities was $6.5 billion compared with $7.0 billion last year end. The decrease was mostly due to debt repayments of $590 million in 2009.  

       During the fourth quarter of 2009, both Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investor Services (Moodys) reaffirmed the Corporations long- and short-term ratings of A and A1 at S&P and A2 and P1 at Moodys, respectively, with an outlook of stable.

       In 2006, the Corporation issued $200 million of dealer remarketable securities that have a final maturity in 2016. In 2009, the dealer exercised its option to remarket the securities for another year and in agreement with the Corporation, sold the securities to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, which intends to hold them until the next remarketing date in December 2010. The investment in these securities by the subsidiary and the Corporations debt obligation for these securities are eliminated in consolidation. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on these securities.  

       At December 31, 2009, the Corporation had a $1.33 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in September 2012. Under the arrangement, the revolving credit facility may be increased to $1.77 billion. The Corporation maintains the revolving credit facility to manage liquidity needs in the event its access to the commercial paper markets is constrained for any reason. The Corporation did not borrow any amounts under the revolving credit facility in 2009.  

       In 2003, the Venezuelan government enacted currency restrictions, which have affected the ability of the Corporations Venezuelan subsidiary (K-C Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency at the official rate of exchange to pay for imported finished goods. These exchange restrictions have negatively impacted K-C Venezuela because it has had to meet its foreign currency needs from non-government sources at the parallel exchange rates, which are substantially unfavorable to the official rate. During 2009, the Corporation recorded its share of pretax losses of more than $195 million or about $.47 per share due to currency transactions at parallel exchange rates. In 2009, K-C Venezuela represented approximately 3 percent of consolidated net sales and 1 percent of consolidated operating profit.  

Because the cumulative inflation in Venezuela for the preceding three years was more than 100 percent, effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation determined that results for this operation would be accounted for as highly inflationary. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and established a multiple exchange rate structure. As a result of the devaluation, the Corporation anticipates recording a one-time after tax charge to remeasure the subsidiarys local currency net monetary asset position into U.S. dollars. The Corporation is currently evaluating the rate at which the devaluation will be measured and 2010 results will be translated into U.S. dollars. The Corporation estimates the range of the one-time after-tax impact of the devaluation to be $60 million to $90 million, based on a rate of 4.3 to 6.0 bolivars per U.S. dollar. This charge will be recorded in the first quarter of 2010. At the stated range of rates, the Corporation estimates that the ongoing effect of the devaluation will not be material to the Corporations 2010 net income.  

Management believes that the Corporations ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs in the foreseeable future.  

Variable Interest Entities  

The Corporation has interests in the financing and real estate entities discussed in Item 8, Notes 2, 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The entities described in Item 8, Notes 2 and 8 are consolidated, as are certain of the real estate entities described in Note 13. The nonconsolidated real estate entities do not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the  

27

PART II  

(Continued)  

 reporting period. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Corporations financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension and other postretirement benefits, retained insurable risks, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets, the qualitative and quantitative analyses of variability used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and loss contingencies. These critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Promotion and Rebate Accruals  

Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the Corporation and its trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by the Corporations customers to promote the Corporations products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $364 million and $321 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $365 million and $261 million, respectively.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension Benefits  

The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the United Kingdom have defined benefit pension plans (the Principal Plans) and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in these countries. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded.  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $251 million in 2009 compared with $97 million for 2008. Pension expense included curtailment charges of about $21 million in 2009 related to the freeze of the Corporations U.S. defined benefit pension plans, and special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions of about $5 million in 2008. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 8.17 percent in 2009 compared with 8.23 percent in 2008 and will be 7.96 percent in 2010. The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. In setting this assumption, the Corporation considers a number of factors including projected future  

28  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 returns by asset class, current asset allocation and historical long-term market performance. As part of the factors related to historical market performance, the Corporation considered the range of compounded annual returns for 15 rolling 15-year and 20-year periods through 2009 relative to each plans current asset allocation.  

The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the Principal Plans was 8.47 percent in 2009 compared with 8.48 percent in 2008 and will be 8.19 percent in 2010. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 65 percent with equity managers, with expected long-term rates of return ranging from 9 to 10 percent, and about 35 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return ranging from 6 to 7 percent. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Long-term rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary.  

Pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. The variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a Calculated Value was used for plan assets. As of December 31, 2009, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $2.2 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required.  

The discount (or settlement) rates used to determine the present values of the Corporations future U.S. and Canadian pension obligations at December 31, 2009 were based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years. Each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rates for the U.S. and Canadian pension obligations. For the U.K. plans, discount rates were established using the yield on a U.K. bond index comprised of high quality corporate debt securities, with the yield adjusted for duration differences between the index and the pension obligations and for securities in the index recently downgraded below high quality. The weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans decreased to 5.88 percent at December 31, 2009 from 6.47 percent at December 31, 2008.  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $160 million in 2010. The decrease in estimated pension expense for 2010 from $251 million incurred in 2009 reflects substantially higher plan assets at December 31, 2009. The 2010 estimate is based on an expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 8.19 percent, a weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 5.88 percent and various other assumptions. Pension expense beyond 2010 will depend on future investment performance, the Corporations contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.  

If the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $10 million in 2010. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, annual pension expense would increase by approximately $7 million and the December 31, 2009 pension liability would increase by about $157 million.  

The fair value of the assets in the Corporations defined benefit plans was $4.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The projected benefit obligations of the defined  

29  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation contributed about $845 million to its pension plans in 2009 compared with $129 million in 2008. In addition, the Corporation made direct benefit payments of $25 million in 2009 compared to $14 million in 2008. The Corporation currently anticipates contributing about $240 million to its pension plans in 2010.  

The methodology for determining the discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the Corporations consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted-average discount rates.  

Other Postretirement Benefits  

Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and/or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993, contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, and the Corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003.  

The Corporation made benefit payments of $71 million in 2009 compared with $73 million in 2008. The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, 2010 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than $1 million and the December 31, 2009 benefit liability would increase by about $17 million.  

The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the Corporations recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. The annual increase in the consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 7.1 percent in 2010, 7.1 percent in 2011 and to gradually decline to 5.0 percent in 2015 and thereafter. See Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate.  

Retained Insurable Risks  

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and managements judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability, are based upon undiscounted loss development factors.  

Property and Depreciation  

Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and  

30  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. The determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probability-weighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk-free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value.  

The estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if the Corporations products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and additional impairment charges may be recognized.  

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the Corporations businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices and costs are also tested. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated.  

If a possible impairment is indicated, the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. The annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and, as the fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value, it has been determined that the Corporations $3.3 billion of goodwill is not impaired.  

The Corporation has no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation has other intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of approximately $505 million and a net carrying amount of about $297 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value (based on discounted future cash flows). Judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above.  

Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)  

The primary beneficiary of variable interest entities is required to be determined using a qualitative analysis to identify the risks in the VIE that cause variability and then to determine the variability that the VIE is designed to create and pass along to its participants. The participant that absorbs the majority of the variability is the  

31  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. If the qualitative analysis is inconclusive, a quantitative analysis is required to estimate the probable future cash flows of the VIE using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values; the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary. Both the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis require the exercise of significant management judgment.  

Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments  

As of December 31, 2009, the Corporation had recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $816 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $225 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $591 million. As of December 31, 2008, the net deferred tax asset was $420 million. These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

As of December 31, 2009, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $5.8 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non-U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination, as appropriate.  

The Corporation accrues net liabilities for current income taxes for potential assessments, which at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were $391 million and $332 million, respectively. The accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Corporations U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2005. IRS assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2001. Refund actions are pending with the IRS for the years 1999 through 2005. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

Loss Contingencies  

The outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the Corporation is subject to uncertainty. An estimated loss contingency is accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate. Changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies.

Legal Matters  

The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in managements opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

New Accounting Standards  

See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on the Corporations consolidated financial statements.  

Business Outlook  

The Corporation is planning for a slow and modest economic recovery in 2010. The Corporation believes that expected benefits from sales growth, cost savings and benefits from stronger currency exchange rates will more than offset inflation in key cost inputs and planned increases in marketing spending. In 2010, the Corporation intends to continue to focus on its targeted growth initiatives, innovation programs and research and customer development capabilities, while reducing costs and maximizing cash flow. The Corporation has resumed share repurchases in 2010 and increased the amount of its regular quarterly dividend.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K or related documents, a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference, concerning, among other things, the business outlook, including economic conditions, sales levels, anticipated currency rates and exchange risk, anticipated impact of acquisitions, cost savings, changes in finished product selling prices, anticipated raw material and energy costs, anticipated benefits related to the organization optimization initiative, cash flow levels, dividend amounts, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies and anticipated transactions of the Corporation, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Corporation. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the Corporations results will be as estimated.  

The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside the control of the Corporation, including the prices and availability of the Corporations raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the Corporations products, energy costs, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the Corporation does business, could impact the realization of such estimates.  

The factors described under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K, or in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, among others, could cause the Corporations future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Corporation. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.
