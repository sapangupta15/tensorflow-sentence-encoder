Business Strategy and Overview

We are the leading integrated marketing, logistics and refining company in our strategic footprint and are driven to create value by operating an integrated business model. Our diversified and integrated portfolio of assets and operations provides us with strong growth opportunities across our value chains.

In recent years, we have implemented strategies to transform the composition of our portfolio of marketing, logistics and refining assets. In 2010, the majority of our operating income was generated through our Refining segment with only a small portion attributable to our previous retail segment and we did not have commercial logistics operations. However, in recent years, we have successfully implemented strategies to drive operational productivity improvements, organic growth and portfolio enhancing acquisitions. Identifying new value creation opportunities to grow the Company is core to our strategy. Our focused execution of this strategy has resulted in a transformation of the Company into a highly integrated, well diversified marketing, logistics and refining business. As of 2017, our Marketing segment continues to expand and Andeavor Logistics has grown significantly resulting in each having a larger and more balanced contribution to our operating results. We believe our integrated business model coupled with our Guiding Principles and Strategic Priorities will position us to create leading value for our investors.

Our Strategy and Goals

Execution of our strategy and the achievement of our goals across our business segments is driven by our commitment to our Guiding Principles and Strategic Priorities that are discussed further in Item 1. The following discussion outlines how we create value across our integrated business segments.

Marketing

Our marketing operations provide a secure and ratable off-take of gasoline and diesel production from our refineries and allow us to enhance our margin capture as refined product moves through the value chain. We are driving growth and improvements in our Marketing segment by focusing on higher value, branded distribution channels, adding new retail sites to our network and implementing store improvements to enhance our convenience store position.

With the closing of the Western Refining Acquisition, we added 544 stations to our branded network, including 457 company-operated stations, and along with other strategic, immaterial acquisitions increased our store count to over 3,250 stations. These stations will further drive volumes through higher-value, branded channels thus maximizing capture of margin downstream within the value chain.

Logistics

Our Logistics segment includes assets that establish a market position that helps to minimize our transportation costs as well as maximize our overall performance by focusing on a stable, fee-based business. We achieve value by optimizing our existing asset base, pursuing organic expansion opportunities and growing through strategic acquisitions across our terminalling and transportation and gathering and processing businesses.

Refining

In our Refining segment, our strategy focuses on:

•driving operational excellence enabling asset availability in excess of 97%;

•maintaining strict operating cost discipline;

•enhancing capital efficiency through superior execution; and

•maximizing capital productivity through process optimization including our ability to access regionally advantaged crude oil.

To meet our strategic objectives, we invest in high return capital projects designed to enhance our feedstock flexibility, improve our yields and lower our costs. In addition to the above strategies and goals, we aim to execute on our strategic priorities to further create value for our shareholders through the achievement of annual improvements to operating income and the capturing of synergies associated with the Western Refining Acquisition.

2017 Performance Objectives

Improvements to Operating Income

Our plans, as presented in November 2016, were to deliver $475 to $575 million of improvements to operating income during 2017, which is comprised of $395 to $475 million of growth and productivity and $80 to $100 million of higher throughput and other operational improvements. These improvements consist of $45 to $70 million in Marketing, $125 to $150 million in Logistics and $305 to $355 million in Refining. In addition to these improvements, we outlined market assumptions for 2017, including fuel margins of 11 to 14 cents per gallon in our Marketing segment and an Andeavor Index of $12 to $14 per throughput barrel in our Refining segment. All of these improvements exclude any expected synergies from the Western Refining Acquisition.

Andeavor exceeded its target and delivered approximately $505 million of growth and productivity improvements to operating income in 2017. Those improvements consisted of $40 million in Marketing, $175 million in Logistics and $290 million in Refining.

Synergies

Concurrent with the closing of the Western Refining Acquisition, we outlined expected synergies of $350 to $425 million on an annual basis with this run rate expected to be achieved by June 2019, the second year following the closing of the transaction. This includes approximately $120 to $160 million from value chain optimization, $130 to $140 million from operational improvements and $100 to $125 million from corporate efficiencies. We estimate that we realized approximately $80 million of synergies as of December 31, 2017 resulting in approximately $190 million of annual run-rate synergies being achieved through the fourth quarter of 2017, consisting primarily of approximately $100 million in corporate efficiencies and the remainder in value chain optimization and operational improvements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Andeavor’s Journey to 2020

At our December 5, 2017 Investor and Analyst Day, we laid out plans to grow our business and earnings through 2020. Our journey to creating superior value in 2020 is based on the following:

•advancing our fully-integrated fuel and convenience store marketing and wholesale businesses;

•expanding our customer-focused, full-service, diversified midstream business, strategically integrated into our value chain;

•enhancing our integrated refining system and maximize margin capture of our value chain through regional optimization;

•identifying and capturing opportunities across the value chain that drive higher integrated margins; and

•focusing on disciplined allocation of capital and financial strength.

Our five strategic actions leading to the growth are delivering the remaining Western Refining synergies, executing on $175 million of income growth from strategic Refining capital projects, achieving $300 million of profitability growth in our Marketing segment by growing both the fuel and convenience store businesses, investing in organic projects and drop downs in our Logistics segment resulting in $430 million of profitability growth and improving costs and driving productivity in our Refining segment resulting in $175 million of growth. We plan to improve results by spending relatively the same amount of capital that we have the last two years. From 2015 to 2017, we spent on average about $1.3 billion per year in capital expenditures and we plan to spend on average approximately $1.4 billion per year from 2018 to 2020. These expectations assume an Andeavor Index of $12 to $14 per throughput barrel in our Refining segment and fuel margins of 11 to 14 cents per gallon in our Marketing segment over the next three years.

Marketing

Our Marketing segment is a key part of our integrated value chain as it provides a stable placement for our products and creates value by improving and maximizing margins. The objective for our Marketing segment is to be a leading convenience marketer, and we have a significant opportunity to excel at both fuel and convenience marketing. We are targeting segment growth by 2020 by increasing Retail and Branded fuel volumes to approximately 52% of total fuel volumes, expanding Retail and Branded stations to over 4,000, improving convenience margin contribution, investing in store enhancements and focusing on key brands and developing a network of 250 to 300 stations in northwest Mexico.

Logistics

Our Logistics segment is a leading midstream service provider and supports our integrated value chain by being able to leverage our commercial capabilities. We are targeting segment growth through 2020 by executing on $1.0 billion of annual high-return growth investments including drop downs from Andeavor, investing in projects to support our growth in the Permian and Bakken regions and increasing third-party revenues.

Refining

Our Refining system is reliable, efficient, strategically located and geographically diverse. We capture differential value by operating with a focus on integration both amongst the refineries and across the whole value chain. We are targeting growth through 2020 by investing in major capital projects, capturing additional Western Refining synergies, improving productivity, efficiency and costs, maintaining high utilization with a focus on our Operational Excellence Management System and creating value by optimizing the integrated value chain.

Results of Operations

A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.

Market Overview

Our results from operations may be impacted significantly from market volatility through the price of crude oil and other feedstocks we acquire for refining and the price we can sell our refined products through our Marketing and Refining segments. Refined product values and crude oil prices are generally set by the global market balances. However, refined product demand trends and crude oil supplies in the U.S. and globally have a significant impact on our business. Additionally, refinery disruptions, planned maintenance, changing logistical infrastructure and healthy domestic macroeconomic conditions continue to influence all portions of our business. 

  December 31, 2017 | 33

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Refined Products

Globally, crude and product inventory levels have declined from last year. However, continued improvement in global macro-economic factors remains supportive to healthy refined product demand. In the markets in which we operate, refined product fundamentals continued to experience volatility. U.S. refiners ran at near-full capacity throughout the year, exceeding prior seasonal high crude run rates. The exception was during the third quarter when domestic refining utilization declined markedly when multiple large-scale hurricanes impacted Gulf Coast refineries. Despite high gasoline production and relatively flat domestic demand growth, U.S. gasoline inventories ended the year slightly below 2016 levels due to increased export demand. At the start of the year, U.S. distillate inventories displayed a significant supply surplus over demand that carried over from 2016. The healthy distillate demand growth and high export levels outpaced strong production, which led to stock draws throughout the year.

Logistics

During 2017, the spot prices of the commodities that our Logistics segment handles largely improved in 2017. Crude oil, refined products, and the majority of NGL prices increased while prices for natural gas decreased. The U.S. oil and gas drilling landscape improved from 2016 due to price appreciation, increased rig counts and operator efficiencies. Domestic crude production exhibited material growth in 2017, which resulted in significantly higher U.S. crude exports. The higher crude price experienced in the fourth quarter has further improved shale economics and U.S. crude production is expected to continue to grow in 2018. From a products perspective, growing export opportunities are providing an incentive for U.S. refiners to maximize production of gasoline and diesel. These factors create a positive outlook for U.S. oil, natural gas and refined product throughput volumes, however, regional impacts may differ.

Continued improvements in the U.S. economic landscape such as lower unemployment, wage growth, strong consumer sentiment, robust manufacturing and expansion of petrochemical plants support healthy refined product demand from our downstream and marketing customers. We continue to monitor the impact of commodity prices and fundamentals as it relates to our business. Given the outlined market conditions, we believe our diversified portfolio of businesses as well as our strong customer base are sufficient to continue to meet our goals and objectives outlined above.

Refining Margins

The market prices for crude oil and other feedstocks continued to experience significant volatility during the year. In the first half of the year, the price of Brent crude oil declined nearly $9 per barrel as OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts did not lead to a reduction of high inventories within well developed countries. However, in the second half of 2017, the price of Brent crude oil increased nearly 40% ending the year higher by over $10 per barrel. During this time, U.S. crude stocks drew over 75 million barrels, significantly narrowing the variance over the 5 year average, on strong refinery demand and tempered import levels. U.S. crude production displayed strong growth throughout the year as shale economics improved due to operator efficiencies and a higher price environment. The increase of domestic light crude production led to export growth throughout the year. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter as export economics became more favorable due to the widening of the price spread between Brent crude oil (“Brent”) and West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). West Coast refinery output remained robust through much of the year. However, various planned and unplanned downtime saw utilization rates lag behind the record levels seen in overall U.S. West Coast margins that averaged near typical seasonal values supported by healthy gasoline demand and refined product exports. We continue to monitor the impact of changes on prices and fundamentals on our business.

As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we have utilized the West Coast and Mid-Continent crack spreads. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products and is a commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in refining margins. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly over time as a result of market conditions and supply and demand balances. The West Coast 321 crack spread is calculated using 3 barrels of Alaska North Slope crude oil (“ANS”) producing 2 barrels of Los Angeles CARB gasoline and 1 barrel of Los Angeles CARB diesel. The Mid-Continent 321 crack spread is calculated using 3 barrels of WTI crude oil producing 2 barrels of Group 3 gasoline and 1 barrel of Group 3 diesel.

West Coast and Mid Continent crack spreads increased during 2017 compared to last year. The U.S. West Coast crack spread averaged $17.66 per barrel in 2017 compared to $16.24 per barrel in 2016. The Mid-Continent crack spread averaged $20.37 per barrel in 2017 compared to $16.12 per barrel in 2016.

Our actual refining margins differ from these crack spreads based on the actual slate of crude oil we run at our refineries and the products we produce. The global commodity markets for crude oil and refined products are subject to significant volatility resulting in rapidly changing prices and margin environments. Our refineries process a variety of crude oils that are sourced from around the world. The slate of crude oil we process can vary over time as a result of changes in market prices and shipping rates. Additionally, our refining margin is impacted by the changing crude oil price differentials, which is the difference between the benchmark crude oils, WTI and Brent crude oil, and the actual crude oil we run at our refineries. We may experience financial risk associated with price volatility of crude oil and refined products, and we may utilize financial hedge instruments to help mitigate such risks where possible.

Crude Oil Differentials ($/Barrel)

Items Impacting Comparability

During 2017, we revised the title of certain of our financial statement line items to avoid any misperception that the amounts included are equivalent to financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The underlying financial information has not changed from what we have previously disclosed. See our discussion under “Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information about the financial measures we use to analyze our operations.

On June 1, 2017, we closed the Western Refining Acquisition. Our results include the operations from Western Refining for the period of June 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and thus prior periods may not be comparable. With the Western Refining Acquisition, we have updated our segments to reflect the results and operations of Western Refining and WNRL. Our Marketing segment reflects our expanded marketing business that, combined with Western Refining, now consists of expanded wholesale marketing operations from WNRL and over 3,250 retail stations marketed under multiple well-known fuel brands including ARCO®, Shell®, Mobil™ and SUPERAMERICA®. Our renamed Logistics segment includes the results of Andeavor Logistics, excluding WNRL’s Wholesale business. We now report the Logistics segment’s results for the combined Terminalling and Transportation and Gathering and Processing business lines. Our Refining segment reports the results of our refining system that now consists of ten refineries in the western and mid-continent United States with a combined capacity of approximately 1.2 million barrels per day. The Refining segment includes the results from Andeavor’s existing Refining segment along with the Refining business contributed in the Western Refining Acquisition.

Non-GAAP Measures

During 2017, we expanded our listing of certain “non-GAAP” performance measures our management uses to analyze operating segment performance and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are defined in our glossary of terms. These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:

•EBITDA

•Segment EBITDA

•Fuel margin

•Fuel margin per gallon

•Merchandise margin

•Merchandise margin percentage

•Average margin on NGL sales per barrel

•Refining margin

•Refining margin per throughput barrel

•Manufacturing costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) per throughput barrel

We present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to:

•our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the refining, logistics and marketing industries, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;

•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and

•the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.

  December 31, 2017 | 35

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Management also uses these measures to assess internal performance. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

2017 Versus 2016

Operating Income Reconciliation by Segment (in millions)

Overview

Our net earnings in 2017 of $1.7 billion increased $823 million, or 96% from net earnings of $860 million in 2016, primarily due to a $918 million benefit related to the impact of Federal tax reform and the Western Refining Acquisition offset by higher general and administrative costs and interest and financing costs. Similarly, EBITDA of $2.6 billion in 2017 increased $171 million, or 7%, from $2.4 billion in 2016 as a result of the Western Refining Acquisition.

Segment Results

Operating income increased slightly to $1.5 billion during 2017 compared to 2016 driven by increases in our Refining and Logistics segments that were offset by an increase in corporate costs as discussed further below. Refer to our detailed discussion of each segment’s operating and financial results contained in this section.

Corporate Costs

General and administrative expenses increased $341 million in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to $222 million in acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with the Western Refining Acquisition, WNRL Merger and the IDR buy-in transaction. Additionally, the addition of Western Refining contributed to the increase. Included in the integration costs were $53 million of severance and equity payouts, of which $42 million was due to the change of control and $11 million due to expected severance and retention payments.

Interest and Financing Costs, Net

Interest and financing costs increased approximately $165 million to $439 million during 2017 from $274 million in 2016. The increase was driven by transactional costs of new Andeavor Logistics senior notes during 2017 that included $60 million in early redemption premiums and $17 million in write-offs of unamortized issuance costs. Also contributing to the increase was a $76 million impact from a full year of interest on our senior notes issued in December 2016 in addition to a $46 million increase from a full year of interest on the Andeavor Logistics senior notes issued in 2016. See further discussion of senior note issuances and debt repayments in the “Capital Resources and Liquidity” section. Partially offsetting the annual increase was a one-time bridge fee paid in 2016 related to the Western Refining Acquisition.

Other Income, Net

Other income during 2016 included nonrecurring gains of $15 million related to pipeline tariff refunds received in California, $13 million of proceeds related to an insurance settlement on a contaminated crude oil shipment we received in 2013 and a $9 million gain related to an adjustment permitted in the agreement from the 2013 acquisition of the ARCO® brand.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

Our income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $560 million in 2017 versus income tax expense of $427 million in 2016. The year over year income tax variance is primarily attributable to a $918 million benefit arising from the impact of the recently enacted federal Tax Act coupled with a decrease in earnings before income taxes. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was (50.2)% and 33.4% during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the impact of the federal Tax Act.

Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax

Earnings from discontinued operations related to Tesoro Hawaii, LLC, (the “Hawaii Business”), net of tax, were $8 million in 2017, compared to $10 million in 2016. The earnings in 2017 relate to the lowering of an estimate for remaining regulatory improvements to be made in Hawaii and 2016 related to proceeds from the 2014 and 2015 calendar year earn-out payments received.

  December 31, 2017 | 37

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

2016 Versus 2015

Operating Income Reconciliation by Segment (in millions)

Overview

Our net earnings in 2016 of $860 million decreased from net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2015 primarily due to the weaker margin environment within our Refining segment. Similarly, EBITDA of $2.4 billion in 2016 declined $1.2 billion, or 33%, from $3.6 billion in 2015 as a result of the weaker margin environment.

Segment Results

Operating income decreased $1.3 billion during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease of $1.3 billion in our Refining segment. Refer to our detailed discussion of each segment’s operating and financial results contained in this section.

Interest and Financing Costs, Net

Interest and financing costs increased approximately $57 million to $274 million during 2016 from $217 million in 2015. The increase was attributable to the write-off of deferred financing costs related to revolver amendments and bridge facility fees in anticipation of the Western Refining acquisition and new debt issuances in the year, primarily the $250 million aggregate principal amount of Andeavor Logistics’ 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2021 and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of Andeavor Logistics’ 6.375% Senior Notes due in 2024 issued in May 2016.

Other Income, Net

Other income during 2016 included gains of $15 million related to pipeline tariff refunds received in California, $13 million proceeds related to an insurance settlement on contaminated crude oil shipment we received in 2013 and $9 million gain related to an adjustment permitted in the agreement from the 2013 acquisition of the ARCO® brand. In 2015, other income included a gain for an insurance settlement of $11 million related to the Washington Refinery Fire.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $427 million in 2016 versus $936 million in 2015. The decreased income tax expense is attributable to the decrease in earnings before income taxes. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 33.4% and 35.6% during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compared to 2015, the income from non-taxable noncontrolling interests attributable to Andeavor Logistics was a higher percentage of earnings before income taxes. The 2016 rate also benefited from a $16 million decrease in expense related to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.”

Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax

Earnings from discontinued operations related to the Hawaii Business, net of tax, were $10 million in 2016, compared to a $4 million loss in 2015. The earnings in 2016 primarily related to proceeds from the calendar year 2015 earn-out owed to the Company. The loss in 2015 was related to a change in estimate for the regulatory improvements we were required to make.

Operational Data and Results

Management uses fuel margin per gallon and merchandise margin to compare results to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel margin per gallon and merchandise margin; different companies may calculate them in different ways. We report fuel margin separate for our retail and branded operations as well as our unbranded operations due to the difference in margin economics in these channels. Fuel margin and fuel margin per gallon include the effect of intersegment purchases from the Refining segment. Merchandise margin is frequently used in the convenience store industry to measure operating results related to merchandise sales. Investors and analysts may use these metrics to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to revenues, segment operating income or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

2017 Versus 2016

Overview

Operating income decreased $42 million, or 5%, and Segment EBITDA decreased $33 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to weaker California fuel margins partially offset by contributions from the Western Refining Acquisition and retail stations acquired in northern California. 

Retail and Branded Fuel Margin

Fuel margin remained relatively flat at $1.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. During the first half of 2017, inclement weather along the west coast negatively impacted demand while rising spot prices in the second half of 2017 negatively impacted margins. These impacts were offset by margin contributions from the Western Refining Acquisition. Volumes increased 518 million gallons due to growth in our network from the Western Refining Acquisition, sales from 39 stations acquired in northern California and organic growth in our branded network.

Unbranded Fuel Margin

Fuel margin increased $41 million to $110 million in 2017 due to increased fuel sale volumes of 1.1 billion gallons primarily driven by the Western Refining Acquisition.

Convenience Margin

Convenience margin increased $155 million to $223 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflecting contributions of the company-operated stations included in the Western Refining Acquisition. This also resulted in a decreased merchandise margin percentage to 27.1% in 2017 compared to 34.4% in 2016 due to the product mix of the acquired business.

Operating Expenses and Depreciation

Operating expenses increased $213 million and depreciation and amortization expenses increased $19 million in 2017 versus 2016 primarily due to higher operating costs associated with company-operated stations acquired in the Western Refining Acquisition.

Operating income decreased $69 million, or 8%, to $830 million in 2016 compared to $899 million in 2015 and Segment EBITDA decreased $56 million to $889 million in 2016 compared to $945 million in 2015. These decreases were primarily due to lower gasoline margins in 2016 in all of the regions we operate in, particularly in the West Coast region. 

Retail and Branded Fuel Margin

Fuel margin decreased $73 million, or 6%, to $1.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to 2016 margins approaching the low end of the 5-year range with 2015 at near record levels partially offset by a 5% increase in volumes driven by growth in our retail and branded network.

Unbranded Fuel Margin

Fuel margin decreased $5 million to $69 million in 2016 with slightly lower per gallon margins offset by a modest increase in sales volumes.

Convenience Margin

Convenience margin increased $10 million to $68 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflecting the growth of our retail and branded network.

Logistics Segment Operating Results (in millions, except per barrel and per MMBtu)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2017 Versus 2016

Overview

Operating income for our Logistics segment increased from $487 million in 2016 to $665 million in 2017 and Segment EBITDA increased from $696 million to $954 million, respectively. These increases were driven by Andeavor Logistics’ acquisitions of the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets and the Northern California Terminalling and Storage Assets from Andeavor in the second half of 2016, the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets in January 2017 and from the operations obtained through the Western Refining Acquisition during 2017. The 2017 results also reflect a $25 million gain on the sale of a refined products terminal in Alaska.

Terminalling and Transportation

Terminalling and transportation revenues, net of operating expenses, increased $167 million, or 41%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher revenues associated with new commercial terminalling and storage agreements executed with our Refining segment in connection with the acquisitions in the second half of 2016. Also contributing to the increase were seven months of contributions from the WNRL operations obtained through the Western Refining Acquisition and higher marine terminalling revenues driven by higher refinery utilization. The increase in revenues was partially offset by higher operating expenses, particularly related to the acquisitions.

Gathering and Processing

Gathering and processing revenues, net of NGL expense and operating expenses, increased $109 million, or 30%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Revenues increased across the natural gas gathering and processing systems and crude oil and water gathering systems due primarily to the acquisition of the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets and expanded capabilities on our existing assets. Also contributing to the increase were seven months of contributions from the WNRL operations obtained through the Western Refining Acquisition. The increases were partially offset by a decline in revenues resulting from lower natural gas volumes in the Rockies Region, incremental operating expenses primarily associated with the acquired assets and estimated costs to complete remediation and closure activities along with long-term monitoring in Tioga, North Dakota.

Logistics Segment Operating Results (in millions, except per barrel and per MMBtu)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2016 Versus 2015

Overview

Operating income for our Logistics segment increased to $487 million in 2016 from $393 million in 2015 and Segment EBITDA increased to $696 million from $587 million. These increases were primarily driven by the full year impact of the LA Storage and Handling Assets purchased in November 2015 and the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets purchased in 2016.

Terminalling and Transportation

Terminalling and transportation revenues, net of operating expenses, increased $101 million, or 32%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher revenues associated with a full year impact of the new commercial terminalling and storage agreements executed with our Refining segment associated with the LA Storage and Handling Assets and the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets acquisitions, stronger customer demand and organic growth projects adding new capabilities to Andeavor Logistics’ system.

Gathering and Processing

Gathering and processing revenues, net of NGL expense and operating expenses, decreased $9 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Gas gathering and processing volume decreased largely due to the deconsolidation of RGS in 2016 while crude oil and water gathering throughput increased due to increased activity and the completion of expansion projects. Operating expenses increased $5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from the inclusion of gross operating expenses related to Andeavor Logistics’ transactions with RGS in 2016 that were previously eliminated upon consolidation as well as additional expenses related to acquisitions during 2016 partially offset by a reduction in the environmental remediation costs recognized in 2016 compare to 2015 related to the 2013 release of crude oil in a rural field northeast of Tioga, North Dakota.

Operational Data and Results

Various operating metrics are used by management to evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare profitability to other companies in the industry. These measures include:

•Refining utilization;

•Refining margin;

•Refining margin per barrel of throughput; and 

•Manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense per throughput barrel.

Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Refining Utilization (a)

(a)Andeavor had a total refining capacity of 1,157 Mbpd in 2017 following the Western Refining Acquisition and 895 Mbpd in 2016 following the acquisition of the Dickinson refinery. In December 2015, we updated our capacity to 875 Mbpd after the completion of several key capital projects. For purposes of the utilization calculation above, a total refining capacity of 850 Mbpd was used for the year ended December 31, 2015.

2017 Versus 2016

Overview

Operating income for our Refining segment increased $250 million, or 47%, to $785 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the Western Refining Acquisition and a stronger margin environment. Average U.S. West Coast and Mid-Continent crack spreads were up approximately $1.42 and $4.25 per barrel, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016. Total refinery utilization increased slightly to 95% in 2017 from the 93% experienced in 2016 due to higher turnaround and maintenance activities in 2016.

California Region

Refining margin decreased $180 million in 2017 to $1.9 billion, or $10.10 per barrel, compared to $2.1 billion, or $11.36 per barrel in 2016 as the refining throughput increased for the region by 16 Mbpd to 523 Mbpd for 2017. The lower refining margin was primarily driven by the year on year change in the LCM. There was no LCM margin impact in 2017 compared to a benefit to the refining margin in 2016 of $236 million. In addition, manufacturing costs increased in 2017 to $6.11 per barrel compared to $6.02 per barrel driven by higher energy prices and the timing of maintenance expenses.

Pacific Northwest Region

Refining margin increased $45 million in 2017 to $560 million, or $8.20 per barrel, compared to $515 million, or $7.77 per barrel in 2016, primarily due to a more favorable margin environment and an increase in refining throughput for the region of 6 Mbpd to 187 Mbpd for 2017. Partially offsetting this increase was the year on year change in LCM impact. There was no LCM margin impact in 2017 compared to a positive impact to refining margin in 2016 of $84 million. In addition, manufacturing costs increased in 2017 to $4.06 per barrel compared to $3.90 per barrel driven by higher energy prices and unplanned maintenance expenses.

Mid-Continent Region

Refining margin increased in 2017 to $1.4 billion, or $12.91 per barrel, compared to $523 million, or $10.43 per barrel in 2016, primarily due to the results from the operations from the Western Refining Acquisition for seven months of 2017, which led to a significant increase in refining throughput for the region of 150 Mbpd to 287 Mbpd in 2017. Partially offsetting this impact was the year on year change in LCM impact. There was no LCM margin impact in 2017 compared to a positive impact to the refining margin in 2016 of $39 million. In addition, manufacturing costs increased in 2017 to $4.88 per barrel compared to $4.29 per barrel in 2016 driven by the Western Refining Acquisition.

2016 Versus 2015

Overview

Operating income for our Refining segment decreased $1.3 billion, or 71%, to $535 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a weaker margin environment. Average U.S. West Coast and Mid-Continent crack spreads were down approximately $5.53 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015. Total refinery utilization of 93% in 2016 was in line with the utilization we experienced in 2015.

California Region

Refining margin decreased $824 million in 2016 to $2.1 billion, or $11.36 per barrel, primarily driven by a weaker refining margin environment in the region when compared to $2.9 billion, or $16.29 per barrel in 2015, Partially offsetting the effects of the refining margin environment was the positive impact of the LCM adjustment in 2016 and continued demand growth for our refined products. Manufacturing costs decreased in 2016 to $6.02 per barrel compared to $6.37 per barrel driven by lower energy prices and the timing of maintenance expenses.

Pacific Northwest Region

Refining margin decreased $165 million in 2016 to $515 million, or $7.77 per barrel, primarily driven by a weaker refining margin environment in the region when compared to $680 million, or $10.96 per barrel in 2015, Partially offsetting the effects of the refining margin environment was the positive impact of the LCM adjustment in 2016 and continued demand growth for our refined products. Manufacturing costs decreased in 2016 to $3.90 per barrel compared to $4.37 per barrel driven by lower energy prices and the timing of maintenance expenses.

Mid-Continent Region

Refining margin decreased $209 million in 2016 to $523 million, or $10.43 per barrel, primarily driven by a weaker refining margin environment in the region when compared to $732 million, or $16.17 per barrel in 2015. Partially offsetting the effects of the refining margin environment was the positive impact of the LCM adjustment in 2016 and continued demand growth for our refined products. Other operating expenses as well as depreciation and amortization expenses increased as a result of the acquisitions during 2016. Manufacturing costs remained steady in 2016 at $4.29 per barrel compared to $4.26 per barrel.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Overview

We operate in an environment where our capital resources are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit agreements and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.

Senior Notes by Maturity (in millions)

2017 Debt Transactions

On June 1, 2017, to finance approximately $424 million in total cash consideration, the $1.6 billion repayment of certain Western Refining and Northern Tier Energy LP (“NTI”) indebtedness and fees and expenses related to the Western Refining Acquisition, we borrowed $575 million under our revolving credit facility and utilized cash on hand, including the proceeds from the 4.750% Senior Notes due 2023 and the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2026 that we issued in December 2016. Included in the $1.6 billion of debt repayments were Western Refining’s $532 million Term Loan - 5.25% Credit Facility due 2020, $350 million of 6.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021, $371 million Term Loan - 5.500% Credit Facility due 2023 and NTI’s $350 million of 7.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 along with approximately $45 million to pay down the outstanding credit facilities at Western Refining and NTI upon acquisition. The Western Refining and NTI revolving credit facilities were terminated upon completion of the acquisition. We paid premiums of approximately $23 million in paying off the Western Refining and NTI senior notes, which were included in our purchase price allocation of the Western Refining Acquisition. The WNRL revolving credit facility and senior notes remained after the acquisition. Following the completion of the Western Refining Acquisition, our revolving credit facility increased in capacity from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion in accordance with the amendment entered into in December 2016.

On September 27, 2017, we redeemed all of our outstanding 4.250% senior notes due 2017 for approximately $459 million, including $9 million of accrued interest, by borrowing on the Revolving Credit Facility. Later, on October 30, 2017 and in connection with the WNRL Merger, WNRL terminated all commitments and repaid all amounts outstanding under the WNRL revolving credit facility for approximately $20 million and redeemed all of the then outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2023 for approximately $326 million, including an early payment premium and accrued interest, with borrowings from the Andeavor Logistics Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, on November 16, 2017, Andeavor Logistics completed the public offering of $500 million aggregate principal of 3.500% senior notes due 2022, $750 million aggregate principal of 4.250% senior notes due 2027 and $500 million aggregate principal of 5.200% senior notes due 2047. The proceeds of these senior notes were used to redeem all of Andeavor Logistics’ outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2020 and 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 and to repay borrowings under the Andeavor Logistics Dropdown Credit Facility along with fees and expenses associated with the offering. And finally, on December 14, 2017, we completed the public offering of $500 million aggregate principal of 3.800% senior notes due 2028 and $500 million aggregate principal of 4.500% senior notes due 2048. The proceeds of these senior notes were primarily used to pay down the Revolving Credit Facility.

See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a more detailed discussion regarding the Company’s debt transactions in the year.

Credit Facilities Overview

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations with additional sources available under borrowing capacity from our revolving lines of credit. We ended 2017 with $543 million of cash and cash equivalents, $55 million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $423 million of borrowings outstanding under the Andeavor Logistics Revolving Credit Facility. We believe available capital resources are adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for the available capacities under our credit facilities and expenses and fees associated with our credit facilities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Covenants 

The Andeavor and Andeavor Logistics revolving credit facility agreements and indentures both contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The sole financial covenant that Andeavor is required to maintain, as of the last day of the fiscal quarter, is a Consolidated Total Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the ANDV revolver credit facility agreement) of no greater than 60%. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our debt obligations.

The investment grade rating achievements in 2017 for Andeavor and Andeavor Logistics align with our capital allocation and financial principles. Benefits of Investment Grade Ratings are:

•Lower Cost of Capital - We expect incremental interest savings and lower costs on new issuances.

•Balance Sheet Flexibility - We have the ability to extend our maturity profile to increase duration and match asset life while also benefiting from simplified and less restrictive covenants.

•Financial and Operational Flexibility - We gain access to improved commercial terms that reduce the need for Letters of Credit, enhancing our financial standing with customers, suppliers and partners.

•Improved Market Access - We have greater market depth and breadth that provides stability and reliable access along with better access to subordinated debt and preferred equity markets.

Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends

Return to Shareholders (in millions, except per share)

We are authorized by our Board to purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions at our discretion. The Board’s authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases of our common stock can be made to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards and to meet our obligations under employee benefit and compensation plans, including the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and to fulfill other stock compensation requirements. We purchased approximately 7.0 million shares of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2017 at an average price of $99.43 per share and 3.2 million shares of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2016 at an average price of 78.56 per share for approximately $692 million and $250 million, respectively. In October 2015, our Board approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that became effective upon the full completion of the initial program. In connection with the Western Refining Acquisition, our Board approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. We have over $1.4 billion remaining under our authorized programs.

On February 14, 2018, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.59 per share, payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 28, 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Cash Flow Summary

Components of our Cash Flows (in millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2017 Compared to 2016

Operating Activities 

Net cash from operating activities increased $326 million, or 25%, to $1.6 billion in 2017 compared to $1.3 billion in 2016. The increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to higher net earnings after considering the impacts from non-cash operating activities partially offset by larger net cash outflows due to movements in working capital.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.1 billion, or 85%, to $2.4 billion in 2017 compared to $1.3 billion in 2016 primarily due to funds used for acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in 2017. See “Capital Expenditures” discussed further in this Item as well as the discussion of our acquisitions in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2017 totaled $1.9 billion compared to net cash from financing activities of $2.4 billion in 2016. The $4.3 billion year on year change was primarily due to increases in repayments of debt, repayment on revolving credit facilities, purchases of common stock and lower proceeds from debt offerings of $3.9 billion, $806 million, $442 million and $314 million, respectively. These decreases in cash were partially offset by increases in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and proceeds from Andeavor Logistics’ preferred equity issuance.

2016 Compared to 2015

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities decreased $827 million, or 39%, to $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $2.1 billion in 2015. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to $830 million in lower net earnings in 2016 versus 2015 coupled with a $676 million change in the lower cost of market adjustment offset by changes in working capital in the period.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased $188 million, or 17%, to $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $1.1 billion in 2015 primarily due to funds used for acquisitions in the year partially offset by reduced capital expenditures in 2016. See “Capital Expenditures” in this Item for more information.

Financing Activities

Net cash from financing activities during 2016 totaled $2.4 billion compared to net cash used of $1.1 billion in 2015. The $3.4 billion year on year change was primarily due to $3.1 billion of proceeds from debt offerings in 2016, $265 million more proceeds from issuances of Andeavor Logistics common units and $394 million less purchases of common stock in the year partially offset by no borrowings under the Andeavor Logistics term loan credit agreement in 2016 versus $250 million in 2015. The 2016 debt offerings primarily consisted of the $1.6 billion of senior notes issuances in late 2016 in anticipation of the Western Refining transaction, the $700 million of senior notes issuances by Andeavor Logistics in May 2016 and the $750 million of senior notes issued in December 2016 by Andeavor Logistics. Dividend payments and payments to noncontrolling interests increased $55 million during 2016 compared to 2015.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital spending reflects the Company’s emphasis on long term strategic priorities including continued focus on safety, reliability and value-driven growth. Growth capital expenditures include purchases or construction of new assets and expansion of existing facilities or services that increase throughput capacity or operational capabilities of our assets. Maintenance capital expenditures include projects to extend the life or maintain equipment reliability and integrity. Andeavor regulatory capital expenditures include projects to attain or maintain compliance with regulatory standards. We monitor the effectiveness of our

investments in capital projects as part of our focus on financial discipline and continuous improvement. In addition, for major capital projects, we routinely review project assumptions and project execution as well as obtain third-party evaluations to assist in improving our project planning and execution. Actual and estimated amounts described below include amounts representing capitalized interest and labor. Andeavor primarily funds capital expenditures with cash generated from operations. Andeavor Logistics primarily funds its capital expenditures with cash generated from operations, reimbursements for certain growth and maintenance capital expenditures, borrowings under the Andeavor Logistics Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of additional Andeavor Logistics debt and equity securities, as needed.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

(d)The Enterprise Resource Planning Project will simplify business processes by implementing a standardized and scalable platform across the Company to transform our business information and technology systems and to further streamline our operations, reduce costs and provide for future growth. We expect this project to be a complex, multi-year process that will require significant investments in software and technology. We expect the project to go-live in the first half of 2018.

(e)The Conan Crude Oil Gathering System is a newly constructed crude oil gathering pipeline system located in the Delaware Basin. The pipeline system will be approximately 130 miles in length and transport crude oil from origins in Lea County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas to a terminal to be constructed in Loving County, Texas, where the gathering system interconnects with long-haul pipeline carriers. The first phase of the Conan Crude Oil Gathering Pipeline system will provide capacity of approximately 250 Mbpd and storage capacity of 720,000 barrels. We expect the project to be completed in the second half of 2018.

(f)The Mandan Tier 3 Project is designed to lower the sulfur content in gasoline, which aligns with the new Federal Tier 3 standards. The project will install a gasoline hydrotreater and associated infrastructure with completion expected before the end of 2019.

(g)The Waxy Crude Oil Drilling Program is a drilling joint venture between Andeavor and EP Energy to fund oil and natural gas development located in the Uinta Basin of Utah. This project is limited to 60 wells and included a crude oil supply agreement allowing Andeavor to purchase all of the oil produced along with additional Waxy Crude Oil produced by EP Energy, ensuring ratable Waxy Crude Oil supply for Andeavor’s Salt Lake City Refinery.

(h)The Naphtha Isomerization Project is located at our Anacortes, Washington refinery and will improve our capability to deliver cleaner local transportation fuels. The project is progressing with construction and is designed to lower the sulfur content in gasoline, which aligns with the new Federal Tier 3 standards. We expect the project to be completed in the first half of 2018.

(i)The Carson Terminal Expansion Project will be constructed and funded by Andeavor Logistics. Andeavor Logistics intends to construct and operate two to three million barrels of additional crude oil storage capacity to better accommodate the unloading of marine vessels at the nearby marine terminals, which is expected to reduce transportation costs for Andeavor, such as extended port fees and demurrage.

(j)The North Dakota NGL Logistics Hub will be constructed and funded by Andeavor Logistics. Andeavor Logistics intends to transport mixed NGLs from a third party processing plant in McKenzie County, North Dakota to its Belfield Gas Processing Plant for fractionation and then ship purity NGL products on manifest and unit trains from its Fryburg Rail Terminal.

Turnarounds and Marketing Branding Charges

In addition to our capital spending program, we have expenditures for turnarounds, catalyst and marketing branding charges.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements, other than our leasing arrangements described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

Environmental

We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable third-party recoveries.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls or make other modifications to certain emission sources, equipment or facilities.

Future expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our refineries, tank farms, pipelines and currently and previously owned or operated terminal and retail station properties. The impact of these legislative and regulatory requirements, including any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program or low carbon fuel standards, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, or results of operations.

The Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating RFS2 requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 20.5 billion gallons in 2015 and to increase to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. These requirements could reduce future demand growth 

  December 31, 2017 | 55

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

for petroleum products that we manufacture. In the near term, the RFS2 presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol, alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries. We are currently meeting the RFS2 requirements through a combination of RINs that were carried over from prior periods, blending renewable fuels obtained from third parties and purchases of RINs in the open market. The spending related to the purchases of RINs for 2017 was not material to our operations and the spending for 2018 is not expected to be material based on our operations and the current regulatory environment. Actual costs related to RINs may differ due to changes in the market price of RINs and the ultimate destinations of our products. Additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels. While we cannot currently estimate the ultimate impact of this statute and implementing its regulations for future blending mandates, and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, the ultimate outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations.

In California, AB 32 created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions by requiring that the state return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. In 2016, SB 32 set a new emissions reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and LCFS, to achieve emissions reduction targets. The LCFS became effective in January 2010 and requires a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. In 2011, CARB approved cap-and-trade requirements that became effective in January 2013, and all of AB 32 related regulations are to be fully implemented by 2020. In December 2011, a U.S. District Court ruled that the LCFS violates the U.S. Constitution. CARB appealed the decision and, on September 18, 2013, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s decision and remanded the case to the lower court to rule on whether the ethanol provisions of the LCFS are unconstitutional. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the lower court’s ruling on the LCFS, and the implementation and implications of AB 32 and SB 32 will take many years to realize. On January 1, 2015, transportation fuels were brought into the California cap-and-trade program, making fuel suppliers responsible for carbon emission from their products. The cost for carbon emissions is being passed through to customers. While we believe that the cap and trade requirements will not materially impact our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations, we cannot currently predict the impact of the LCFS and other AB 32 or expected SB 32-related regulations on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Environmental Liabilities

We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental remediation liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities totaling $211 million and $227 million, including $16 million and $22 million for Andeavor Logistics, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

On October 17, 2016, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the July 10, 2015 federal court order denying coverage pursuant to an insurance policy for environmental remediation liabilities at our Martinez refinery. In November 2016, the Court of Appeals denied our petitions for a rehearing. The liabilities are included in our accruals as we have not recognized possible insurance recoveries under the policies. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our environmental obligations.

Other Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have not established accruals for these matters unless a loss is probable and the amount of loss is currently estimable.

Washington Refinery Fire

The naphtha hydrotreater unit at our Washington refinery was involved in a fire in April 2010, which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable. The Washington State Department of L&I investigated of the incident and issued a citation in October 2010 with an assessed fine of approximately $2 million. We appealed the citation in January 2011 as we disagree with L&I’s characterizations of operations at the refinery and believe, based on available evidence and scientific reviews, that many of the agency’s conclusions are mistaken. In separate September 2013, November 2013 and February 2015 orders, the BIIA granted partial summary judgment in our favor rejecting 33 of the original 44 allegations in the citation as lacking legal or evidentiary support. On June 8, 2017, the BIIA Judge issued a proposed decision and order vacating the entire citation, which L&I and the United Steel Workers (“USW”) appealed. On September 18, 2017, the BIIA granted L&I and USW’s petitions for review of the BIIA Judge’s June 8, 2017 proposed decision and order. The hearing on the remaining 11 allegations concluded in July 2016. While we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of the resolution of this matter, we have established an accrual based on our best estimate at this time and believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Environmental

We have investigated conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Martinez refinery pursuant to an order received in 2004 from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board that named us as well as two previous owners of the Martinez refinery. We cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order, but amounts that may be recognized in future periods for remediation of these wastewater treatment units could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

On October 26, 2016, the Utah Supreme Court rejected the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment’s and the Utah Chapter of the Sierra Club’s (“Petitioners”) challenge of an air permit issued by the UDEQ to our Salt Lake City refinery in September 2012. Petitioners had filed a Request for Agency Action (the “Request”) with UDEQ challenging UDEQ’s permitting of our refinery conversion project alleging that the permit did not conform to the requirements of the Clean Air Act. After proceedings before an administrative law judge and the Executive Director of UDEQ’s subsequent dismissal of Petitioners’ Request, Petitioners filed a petition for review with the Utah Court of Appeals in December 2014, and the Court of Appeals certified the case to the Utah Supreme Court. On December 27, 2016, the Utah Supreme Court denied the Petitioners’ petition for rehearing.

In response to incidents in February and March 2014 at our Martinez refinery involving sulfuric acid exposure at the Alkylation Unit, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting an investigation to evaluate the Martinez refinery’s compliance with certain federal environmental acts and the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act. While we cannot currently predict the timing and the resolution of this investigation, we believe the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

Tax

We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations such, including the Tax Act, could materially impact our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows in the future. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our tax matters.

Long-Term Commitments

During the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries along with other debt service and lease arrangements (see Note 12 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to Andeavor Logistics under our various fee-based commercial agreements as these related-party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 

Summary of Contractual Obligations (in millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings. Interest payments assume the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2017.

(b)Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)Represents long-term commitments primarily for the transportation of crude oil, refined products and NGLs as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contract’s minimum volume requirements.

(e)Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.

We also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current, there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Note 14 and 15, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

  December 31, 2017 | 57

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits, with the exception of amounts classified as current, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded from the table $35 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, and excluded from the table, is a liability for potential interest and penalties of $7 million at December 31, 2017. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Pension Funding

We provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees, with benefits based on age and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 6.50% as of December 31, 2017, and the actual return on our funded employee pension plan assets was $60 million, or 11.8%, gain in 2017 and $30 million, or 7.1%, gain in 2016. Based on a 3.65% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2017, the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 55% of the projected benefit obligation. For funding purposes, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, as signed into law in July 2012 and later modified by the BBA stipulates that the discount rate must remain within a specified corridor of a 25-year average corporate bond rate, with such corridor widening from 10% to 30% between 2012 and 2024. On the BBA basis, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding status measure defined under applicable pension funding regulations) was 100% at January 1, 2017. Although our funded employee retirement plan fully meets all of the funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we contributed $87 million and $60 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, to improve the plan’s funded status. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, discount rates, employee demographics, regulatory environments and other factors. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our benefit plans.

Accounting Standards

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For additional information concerning certain estimates and assumptions, see the respective footnotes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy, or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level on November 1 of each year and when circumstances change that might indicate impairment.

We test goodwill for impairment by performing an optional qualitative assessment process and/or using the quantitative assessment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment process and determine it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the reporting unit, a quantitative assessment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is performed. We may elect not to perform a qualitative assessment process and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative assessment process. For reporting units where the quantitative assessment process is performed, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, is compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the reporting unit.

We elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis using a quantitative assessment process on the goodwill recorded in our reporting units of our Logistics segment and the qualitative assessment process on the remaining goodwill in the reporting units in our other two segments as of November 1, 2017.

As part of our quantitative goodwill impairment process for our Logistics’ reporting units, we engaged a third-party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

within a comparable industry grouping. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, the discount rates, terminal growth rates, and forecasts of revenue, operating income and capital expenditures.

Factors utilized in the qualitative assessment include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, company specific operating results and other relevant entity-specific events affecting individual reporting units.

We determined that no impairment charges resulted from our November 1, 2017 goodwill impairment assessment. The fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of carrying values. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and at other times when an event occurs or circumstances change such that an impairment may exist. In evaluating our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value, we would then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts. There were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets (which include property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets with defined useful lives, deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs) are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the net book values of the assets may not be recoverable (for example, current period operating losses combined with a history of operating losses or a temporary shutdown of a refinery) and, if so, assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset’s net book value exceeds its fair market value. Fair market value is based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. We must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $23 million on certain state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2017, which were obtained with the acquisition of Western Refining. The valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. We may need to establish an additional valuation allowance if actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods. We also recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status or a liability if the plans are underfunded. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligations. While we believe the assumptions we used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to the effective yields on high quality corporate bonds that have a comparable cash flow pattern to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans and also uses a three-year average of the market value of plan assets. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

One-Percentage-Point Change in Expected Rate of Return and Discount Rate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.

Environmental Liabilities

We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Usually, the timing of our accruals coincides with when an assessment or claim has been asserted subsequent to which a feasibility study or formal plan of action is undertaken. When we complete our assessment or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties.

Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. Certain of our environmental liabilities, specific to long-term monitoring costs that we believe are fixed and determinable, are recorded on a discounted basis. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate is used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than other, the lower end of the range is used. Possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the financial statements until they become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental remediation are included as part of the estimated liability. The majority of our environmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis.

Acquisitions

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts, and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices, and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization.

While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
