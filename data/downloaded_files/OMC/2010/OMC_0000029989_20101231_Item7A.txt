Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

As a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. We limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. For interest rate exposure, derivatives are used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 

As a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on credit ratings and other factors. 

We evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. We periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk analysis. Value-at-risk is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments. The value-at-risk analysis on our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2010 indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. 

Foreign Exchange 

Our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the U.S. Dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. The effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements. For the most part, our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency. This minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations. 

While our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-U.S. currency markets are the European Monetary Union (EMU), the United Kingdom, Japan, Brazil and Canada. As an integral part of our treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use a multicurrency pool arrangement to manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of the treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. 

In certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with an intercompany treasury center operating in a different currency. To manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with third party banks. At December 31, 2010, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $1,300.0 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these intercompany borrowings and investments. 

Furthermore, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency. In these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts. At December 31, 2010, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $51.8 million related to these activities. 

The forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. These risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. As a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably.  

Interest Rate Risk 

From time to time, we issue debt in the capital markets. In 2010, to manage our overall interest cost, we used interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt and designated the swaps as a fair value hedge. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2010, the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was $1.0 billion. 

The holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount outstanding. The next date on which holders of our 2032 Notes can put the notes back to us for cash is August 2011 and the next date on which holders of our 2038 Notes can put the notes back to us for cash is June 2013. As we have done on prior occasions, we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us.

If we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including our stock price, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. 

If our outstanding convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put. Although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put. Additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. The extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. 

Even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to EBITDA ratio. If we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to interest expense. However, the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. If either our ratio of debt to EBITDA was to increase 50% or our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. Therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. 

Credit Risk 

We provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients. Due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 3.0% of our revenue, and no other client accounted for more than 2.4% of our revenue for 2010. However, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. 

In the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide. Many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clientsÂ’ creditworthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. Further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. In addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. We usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. We manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance. However, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client. We have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or on production costs incurred on behalf of our clients. However, the risk of a material loss could increase in a significant economic downturn.
