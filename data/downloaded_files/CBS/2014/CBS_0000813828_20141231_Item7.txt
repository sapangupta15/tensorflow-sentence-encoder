Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Overview

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television and radio stations, Internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company is increasing its investment in both Company-owned and acquired premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company's content on digital and other platforms through licensing and subscription services; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers' changing habits. The Company’s continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide it with incremental advertising and non-advertising revenues and serves to diversify the Company’s business model.

For 2014, revenues of $13.81 billion decreased 1% from $14.01 billion in 2013 primarily driven by 4% lower advertising revenues as 2013 included the benefit from the broadcast of the Super Bowl on the CBS Television Network and 2014 was impacted by four fewer NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship ("NCAA Tournament") games broadcast on CBS. Taken together these items impacted the revenue comparison by three percentage points. The impact from these items was offset by the addition of Thursday Night Football on CBS in 2014, increased political advertising spending associated with midterm elections, and 6% growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues.

The Company reported operating income of $2.90 billion in 2014, a decrease of 4% from $3.03 billion in 2013, reflecting an increased investment in programming, primarily for National Football League ("NFL") games. The investment in NFL programming has contributed to strong ratings for the 2014/2015 broadcast season, which also includes three successful new Company-owned television series that have all generated higher ratings in their respective time periods compared with the prior season. 

For 2014, net earnings from continuing operations were $1.35 billion compared with $1.74 billion for 2013 and diluted net earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations were $2.41 for 2014 compared with $2.79 for 2013. Comparability of results for 2014 versus 2013 was impacted by several discrete items that were not part of the normal course of operations. The following tables present adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which exclude the impact of these discrete items. These adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled below to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of these items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management and provides a clearer perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company.

(a) Amounts may not sum as a result of rounding.

On April 2, 2014, CBS Outdoor Americas Inc. (“Outdoor Americas”), which was previously a subsidiary of the Company and has been renamed Outfront Media Inc., completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) through which it sold 23.0 million shares, or approximately 19%, of its common stock for $28.00 per share. On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the disposition of its 81% ownership of Outdoor Americas common stock through a tax-free split-off (the “Split-Off”). In connection with the Split-Off, the Company accepted 44.7 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 97.0 million shares of Outdoor Americas common stock that it owned. The Split-Off resulted in a gain of $1.56 billion which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations for 2014. In aggregate, the Company received $4.76 billion from the disposition of Outdoor Americas, including proceeds from Outdoor Americas’ IPO and debt borrowings, and the fair value of shares received in the Split-Off.

During 2013, the Company completed the sale of its outdoor advertising business in Europe, which included an interest in an outdoor business in Asia (“Outdoor Europe”) for $225 million. Outdoor Americas and Outdoor Europe have been presented as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

During 2014, the Company also repurchased 60.3 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $3.61 billion, at an average price of $59.88 per share. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company expects to spend approximately $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. As of February 10, 2015, the Company had $4.08 billion of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program. Also during 2014, the Company declared dividends of $.54 per share, totaling $296 million on its Class A and Class B Common Stock. On January 30, 2015 the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share, payable on April 1, 2015.

During 2014, the Company redeemed $1.17 billion of its debt for $1.51 billion, including early redemption premiums, and also issued $1.75 billion of senior notes at significantly lower interest rates. During January 2015, the Company issued an additional $1.20 billion of senior notes, and used the net proceeds for the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and repayment of short-term borrowings. The Company had $7.72 billion of long-term debt outstanding at January 31, 2015, $6.53 billion at December 31, 2014, and $5.96 billion at December 31, 2013, at weighted average interest rates of 4.7%, 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.21 billion in 2014 and $1.78 billion in 2013. Included in operating cash flow for 2014 are payments of $360 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for early redemption premiums. The decrease in operating cash flow also reflects the timing of payments for sports programming, as well as the benefit to 2013 from CBS's Super Bowl broadcast. These declines were partially offset by higher collections from television licensing sales and contributions of $150 million in 2013 to prefund the Company's qualified pension plans, with no comparable amount in 2014. Free cash flow for 2014 was $1.00 billion compared with $1.57 billion for 2013. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow” on pages II-13 and II-14 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

CBS Corp. operates in the following four segments:

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group, CBS Interactive and CBS Films. Entertainment's revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 60%, 62% and 60% to consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and 45%, 53% and 50% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks' revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 16%, 15% and 14% to consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and 34%, 29% and 28% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster’s consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Atria Books. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 6% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2014, 2013, and 2012, and 3%, 4% and 3% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales and affiliate fees. The Local Broadcasting segment contributed 20%, 19% and 22% to consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and 28%, 27% and 31% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

Consolidated Results of Operations—2014 vs. 2013 and 2013 vs. 2012 

Revenues

The following tables present the Company’s consolidated revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

Advertising revenues decreased 4% to $7.20 billion in 2014 from $7.53 billion in 2013. This decrease reflects the benefit to 2013 from the CBS Television Network's Super Bowl broadcast, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network once every three years, and the broadcast of four fewer NCAA Tournament games on CBS during 2014. Taken together these items impacted the advertising revenue comparison by five percentage points. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of Thursday Night Football on CBS in 2014 as well as political advertising spending associated with midterm elections.

In 2013, advertising revenues increased 5% to $7.53 billion from $7.19 billion in 2012. This growth was principally driven by an increase at the CBS Television Network, including the 2013 broadcast of the Super Bowl, and increases at CBS Interactive. These increases were partially offset by lower political advertising revenues as 2012 benefited from the U.S. presidential election.

In 2015, the local advertising revenue comparison will be impacted by the benefit in 2014 from political advertising spending associated with midterm elections. For national advertising, upfront advertising sales for the 2014/2015 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2014 through the middle of September 2015, resulted in pricing increases with lower overall volume, compared with the 2013/2014 broadcast season. As a result, in 2015 more advertising spots will be available in the scatter advertising market, which is when advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming. Overall advertising revenues will be impacted by ratings for the Company’s programming as well as market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market. (See page I-2 for a description of advertising sales in the upfront and scatter markets.)

Content licensing and distribution

Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced television programming to multiple media platforms and in various geographic locations; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For 2014, content licensing and distribution revenues of $3.99 billion were comparable with 2013 revenues of $4.00 

II-7

billion reflecting higher revenues from the licensing of the Company's television programming offset by lower revenues from book sales and theatrical releases. For 2013, content licensing and distribution revenues increased 15% to $4.00 billion from $3.47 billion in 2012 reflecting growth from the domestic and international licensing of programming. Significant contributors to television licensing revenues in 2014 included Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0, and Dexter and in 2013 included NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife. 

For 2015, the content licensing and distribution revenue comparison will be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of Company-owned television series for multi-year licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition.

Affiliate and subscription fees

Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s cable networks, as well as for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); and subscription fees for online content. For 2014, affiliate and subscription fees increased 6% to $2.36 billion from $2.22 billion in 2013 and for 2013, affiliate and subscription fees increased 16% from $1.92 billion in 2012. These increases reflect higher rates across the Company. For 2014, the increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Showtime Networks' distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. In 2015, the Company expects continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees.

Other

Other revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks and Local Broadcasting operations, decreased 5% to $250 million in 2014 from $262 million in 2013, principally reflecting lower ancillary digital revenues. For 2013, other revenues increased 9% to $262 million from $240 million in 2012 primarily as a result of higher ancillary digital revenues.

International Revenues

International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues. The Company generated approximately 13% of its total revenues from international regions in each of 2014 and 2013, and 12% in 2012.

Operating Expenses

The table below presents the Company’s consolidated operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming expenses represented 36% of total operating expenses for 2014, 38% for 2013 and 36% for 2012, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses decreased 4% to $2.94 billion in 2014 from $3.05 billion in 2013 driven by the absence of costs associated with the CBS Television Network's broadcast of the Super Bowl in 2013. Programming expenses also reflect an increased investment in programming, primarily for Thursday Night Football on CBS, partially offset by lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series during 2014. For 2013, programming expenses increased 16% to $3.05 billion from $2.62 billion in 2012 primarily reflecting higher sports programming costs associated with the 2013 broadcast of the Super Bowl on CBS and Showtime Networks’ distribution of two pay-per-view boxing events, as well as higher investment in acquired television programming.

Production expenses represented 31% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2014 and 2013, and 30% for 2012, and reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. For 2014, production expenses of $2.49 billion remained flat with 2013, as an increased investment in internally developed television programming was offset by lower costs associated with the mix of titles licensed under television licensing arrangements. For 2013, production expenses increased 16% to $2.49 billion from $2.15 billion in 2012 primarily driven by increased revenues from the first-cycle domestic availabilities of NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife, as well as higher investment in internally developed television programming. 

Participation, distribution and royalty costs, which represented 15% of total operating expenses for 2014 and 14% for each of the years 2013 and 2012, primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television and feature film content, such as print and advertising. Participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 7% to $1.19 billion in 2014 from $1.11 billion in 2013, principally due to higher participations and residuals associated with the mix of titles licensed under television licensing arrangements, partially offset by lower advertising costs for feature films. For 2013, participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 11% to $1.11 billion from $1.00 billion in 2012, principally due to higher participations associated with higher revenues from the licensing of television programming.

Other operating expenses, which represented 18% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2014 and 2013, and 21% for 2012, primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For 2014, other operating expenses of $1.47 billion remained flat compared with 2013 and for 2013, decreased 1% to $1.47 billion from $1.49 billion in 2012.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 18% of total revenues for each of the years 2014 and 2013, and 19% for 2012. For 2014, SG&A expenses decreased $84 million, or 3%, to $2.46 billion from $2.55 billion in 2013 primarily reflecting lower stock-based compensation expense, driven by a change in the Company's stock price.

For 2013, SG&A expenses increased $104 million, or 4%, to $2.55 billion from $2.44 billion in 2012 reflecting higher employee-related costs, mainly associated with $75 million higher stock-based compensation primarily from a change in the Company’s stock price and an increase in selling expenses associated with higher revenues. These increases were partially offset by a 2012 charge related to a Publishing legal settlement.

Restructuring Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2014, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization or closure of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $26 million, reflecting $17 million of severance costs and $9 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $20 million, reflecting $14 million of severance costs and $6 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2014, the cumulative amount paid for the 2014 and 2013 restructuring charges was $24 million, of which $17 million was for the severance costs and $7 million related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. The 2013 restructuring reserve was substantially utilized at December 31, 2014. The Company expects to substantially utilize the 2014 restructuring reserve by the end of 2015.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impairment Charges

In December 2014, the Company completed a radio station swap with Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. through which the Company exchanged 13 of its radio stations in Tampa and Charlotte as well as one radio station in Philadelphia, for two radio stations in Philadelphia and three radio stations in Miami. In connection with the radio station swap, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $52 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In 2012, in connection with the sale of its five owned radio stations in West Palm Beach, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $11 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization decreased $9 million, or 3%, to $281 million for 2014 from $290 million for 2013, reflecting lower amortization resulting from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized during 2014. For 2013, depreciation and amortization decreased $16 million, or 5% from $306 million for 2012, reflecting lower depreciation associated with declining capital expenditure levels and lower amortization resulting from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $12 million, or 3%, to $363 million for 2014 from $375 million for 2013 and for 2013, decreased $26 million, or 6% from $401 million for 2012. These decreases were driven by the Company's debt refinancing during 2014 and 2012. During 2014, the Company issued $1.75 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds principally for the early redemption of $1.07 billion of its outstanding debt, which was at significantly higher interest rates, and also redeemed $99 million of outstanding 8.875% notes upon maturity (See "Capital Structure"). 

The Company had $6.53 billion of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 and $5.96 billion at December 31, 2013, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the Company also had $616 million and $475 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at weighted average interest rates of 0.46% and 0.28%, respectively.

During January 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2025 and $600 million of 4.60% senior notes due 2045 and used the net proceeds for the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. The 2015 debt issuances and 2014 debt refinancing activity are expected to result in an annualized net increase to interest expense of approximately $15 million.

Interest Income

Interest income increased $5 million to $13 million for 2014 from $8 million for 2013 and for 2013, increased $3 million from $5 million in 2012.

Net Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For 2014, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million reflected a pretax loss associated with the redemption of the Company's $600 million of 8.875% senior notes due 2019, $423 million of its 7.875% senior debentures due 2030, $37 million of its 7.875% debentures due 2023, and $6 million of its 7.125% senior notes due 2023.

For 2012, the net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $32 million reflected a pretax loss associated with the redemption of the Company’s $338 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2012 and $400 million of 8.20% senior notes due 2014, partially offset by the pretax gain recognized upon the redemption of the Company’s $700 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2056.

Other Items, Net

For all periods presented, “Other items, net” primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains and losses. The loss of $30 million in 2014 was driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 

II-11

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2014, the provision for income taxes was $762 million compared with $878 million in 2013 and $812 million in 2012, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 35%, 33%, and 34%, respectively. The Company's income tax provision for 2014 included a tax benefit of $133 million associated with the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million. For 2015, the Company’s annual effective tax rate is expected to be comparable with the prior three years.

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax

Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, reflects the Company's share of the operating results of its equity investments and was $48 million for 2014, $49 million for 2013, and $37 million for 2012.

 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations

Net earnings from continuing operations of $1.35 billion for 2014 decreased $384 million, or 22%, versus $1.74 billion for 2013, and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased $.38 to $2.41 for 2014 versus $2.79 for 2013. These decreases were driven by lower operating income and the loss on early extinguishment of debt. For 2013 net earnings from continuing operations increased $230 million, or 15% from $1.51 billion for 2012 and diluted EPS increased $.50 from $2.29 for 2012, reflecting higher operating income and lower interest expense. The diluted EPS comparisons in each period benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company's ongoing share repurchase program. For 2014, weighted average shares outstanding also decreased as a result of the Split-Off of Outdoor Americas on July 16, 2014. 

Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations

On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the disposition of Outdoor Americas and, as a result, Outdoor Americas has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. In aggregate, the Company received $4.76 billion from the disposition of Outdoor Americas, including $2.04 billion of cash and $2.72 billion in shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were accepted in the Split-Off. The disposition was completed in three phases. First, in January 2014 Outdoor Americas borrowed $1.60 billion and provided $1.52 billion of the proceeds to the Company. Next, on April 2, 2014, Outdoor Americas completed an IPO through which it sold 23.0 million shares, or approximately 19%, of its common stock for $28.00 per share. Proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, aggregated $615 million, of which $515 million was provided to the Company. Upon completion of the IPO, the Company owned 97.0 million shares, or approximately 81% of Outdoor Americas. Finally, on July 16, 2014, the Company completed the disposition of its 81% ownership of Outdoor Americas common stock through the Split-Off. In connection with the Split-Off, the Company accepted 44.7 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 97.0 million shares of Outdoor Americas common stock that it owned. This transaction resulted in a gain of $1.56 billion in 2014 which is calculated as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Split-Off was a tax-free transaction and therefore, there is no tax impact on the gain.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

During 2013, the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe for $225 million. Outdoor Europe is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods. For 2013, net earnings from discontinued operations include a gain on the disposal of Outdoor Europe and an after-tax charge of $110 million related to Outdoor Europe. This charge was associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement and the estimated fair value of guarantees, which historically were intercompany but upon the closing of the transaction became third-party guarantees (See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).

The following table sets forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Earnings and Diluted EPS

For 2014, net earnings were $2.96 billion, or $5.27 per diluted share, compared with $1.88 billion, or $3.01 per diluted share in 2013 and $1.57 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share in 2012. Included in net earnings for 2014 is a gain of $1.56 billion from the Split-Off of Outdoor Americas. 

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and less capital expenditures. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry.

II-13

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

The following tables present the Company’s revenues; operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (“OIBDA”), restructuring charges and impairment charges (“Segment OIBDA”); operating income (loss); and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The Company presents Segment OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments ("segment profit measure") in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance for segment reporting. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, the Company will present Operating Income excluding restructuring charges and impairment charges as its segment profit measure, in order to align with the primary method the Company's management began using in 2015 to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to its segments. The Company believes the presentation of its segment profit measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA to the Company’s consolidated Net earnings is presented in Note 16 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

2014 vs. 2013 

For 2014, Entertainment revenues decreased 4% to $8.31 billion from $8.65 billion in 2013 reflecting lower advertising revenues and content licensing and distribution revenues, partially offset by growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues. Advertising revenues decreased 7%, mainly driven by the benefit to 2013 from the CBS Television Network's broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on CBS once every three years, and four fewer NCAA Tournament games broadcast on CBS in 2014. These decreases were partially offset by advertising revenues from the broadcast of Thursday Night Football on CBS. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% reflecting the timing of theatrical releases and television licensing revenues. Television licensing revenues in 2014

included the first-cycle domestic syndication sales of Blue Bloods and Hawaii Five-0 and in 2013 included NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife.

For 2014, Entertainment OIBDA decreased $303 million, or 17%, to $1.46 billion from $1.76 billion for 2013 primarily reflecting an increased investment in programming, primarily for NFL games. For 2014, restructuring charges of $8 million principally reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting operating facilities. Restructuring charges of $12 million in 2013 principally reflected costs associated with exiting certain international operations and severance costs.

Revenue comparisons in 2015 will be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of television series for multi-year licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements were $3.57 billion and $3.14 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.56 billion in 2015, $1.00 billion in 2016, $531 million in 2017, $245 million in 2018, and $231 million in 2019 and thereafter. Unrecognized revenues attributable to license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $1.02 billion and $1.14 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

2013 vs. 2012 

For 2013, Entertainment revenues increased 12% to $8.65 billion from $7.69 billion in 2012 reflecting higher advertising revenues, content licensing and distribution revenues and affiliate and subscription fees. Advertising revenues increased 10%, driven by growth at the CBS Television Network of 10%, reflecting higher revenues from sports, including the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVII on the CBS Television Network in 2013, as well as an increase in primetime. Also contributing to the advertising revenue growth was an increase of 18% at CBS Interactive. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 15%, reflecting growth from domestic and international licensing of television programming for digital streaming and syndication, led by the first-cycle domestic availabilities of NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife.

For 2013, Entertainment OIBDA increased $209 million, or 13%, to $1.76 billion from $1.55 billion for 2012, principally driven by the growth in revenues which was partially offset by an increased investment in television content and higher sports programming costs associated with the Super Bowl broadcast. For 2012, restructuring charges of $7 million principally reflected severance costs.

Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks)

(Contributed 16%, 15% and 14% to consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and 34%, 29% and 28% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

2014 vs. 2013

For 2014, Cable Networks revenues increased $107 million, or 5%, to $2.18 billion from $2.07 billion in 2013 driven by higher revenues from the licensing of Showtime original series for digital streaming, mainly Dexter and Californication. Revenue growth also reflects higher affiliate revenues, primarily reflecting rate increases. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. As of December 31, 2014, subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 55 million for CBS Sports Network and 30 million for Smithsonian Networks.

For 2014, Cable Networks OIBDA increased $99 million, or 11%, to $997 million from $898 million for 2013 primarily as a result of the increased revenues and lower programming costs from the timing of premieres. 

In January 2015, Showtime Networks entered into new multi-year content licensing and trademark license agreements under which Company-owned Showtime original series, including library series, will be made available in Canada across all platforms of a Canadian media company, including its new streaming service, as well as its pay television service.

2013 vs. 2012 

For 2013, Cable Networks revenues increased $297 million, or 17%, to $2.07 billion from $1.77 billion in 2012 driven by higher revenues from the licensing of Showtime original series for digital streaming and syndication, led by Dexter; revenues from the distribution of two Floyd Mayweather pay-per-view boxing events; and higher affiliate revenues. Growth in affiliate revenues reflected rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. As of December 31, 2013, subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 51 million for CBS Sports Network and 21 million for Smithsonian Networks.

For 2013, Cable Networks OIBDA increased $87 million, or 11%, to $898 million from $811 million for 2012 principally due to the aforementioned revenue increases, partially offset by higher programming and production costs associated with the pay-per-view boxing events, the increase in licensing revenues and increased investment in Showtime original series. Cable Networks OIBDA margin decreased to 43% in 2013 from 46% in 2012 due to the margin impact from the distribution of the above mentioned pay-per-view boxing events.

Publishing (Simon & Schuster)

(Contributed 6% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2014, 2013, and 2012, and 3%, 4% and 3% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.)

2014 vs. 2013

For 2014, Publishing revenues decreased $31 million, or 4%, to $778 million from $809 million in 2013 reflecting lower book sales as 2013 benefited from the popularity of the Duck Dynasty series. Digital book sales represented 26% of Publishing’s total revenues for 2014. Best-selling titles in 2014 included Hard Choices by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Mercedes by Stephen King.

For 2014, Publishing OIBDA decreased $6 million, or 5%, to $107 million from $113 million for 2013 reflecting the aforementioned lower revenues partially offset by lower inventory, selling and overhead costs. 

2013 vs. 2012 

For 2013, Publishing revenues increased $19 million, or 2%, to $809 million from $790 million in 2012 led by growth in digital book sales. Digital book sales increased 22% from the same prior-year period and represented 27% of Publishing’s total revenues. Best-selling titles in 2013 included Doctor Sleep by Stephen King and Happy, Happy, Happy by Phil Robertson.

For 2013, Publishing OIBDA increased $24 million, or 27%, to $113 million from $89 million for 2012. The increase was mainly driven by the revenue growth, a charge in 2012 related to a legal settlement and a decline in production and distribution costs associated with a higher mix of revenues from digital book sales, partially offset by higher advertising expenses. Restructuring charges of $3 million in 2012 primarily reflected costs associated with combining several of Publishing's imprints.

Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio)

(Contributed 20%, 19% and 22% to consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and 28%, 27% and 31% to consolidated operating income in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2014 vs. 2013

For 2014, Local Broadcasting revenues increased $60 million, or 2%, to $2.76 billion from $2.70 billion in 2013, primarily driven by higher political advertising revenues as a result of midterm elections and growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues. CBS Television Stations revenues grew 4% and CBS Radio revenues increased 1%.

Local Broadcasting OIBDA increased $67 million, or 7%, to $965 million from $898 million for 2013, principally reflecting the increase in revenues as well as lower programming costs, mainly for sports. Restructuring charges of $14 million in 2014 reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. For 2013, restructuring charges of $5 million principally reflected severance costs.

II-18

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In 2015, affiliate and subscription fee revenues are expected to continue to increase, while advertising revenues will be negatively impacted by lower political spending as 2014 benefited from midterm elections. 

2013 vs. 2012

For 2013, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased $78 million, or 3%, to $2.70 billion from $2.77 billion for 2012. CBS Television Stations revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower political advertising and lower revenues from the nonrenewal of an unprofitable sports programming contract. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of the 2013 broadcast of Super Bowl XLVII to the Company’s owned CBS affiliated stations and higher affiliate and subscription fee revenues. CBS Radio revenues decreased 1% principally reflecting the impact of radio station dispositions in 2012, partially offset by the benefit from the new CBS Sports Radio network. 

For 2013, Local Broadcasting OIBDA decreased $59 million, or 6%, to $898 million from $957 million for 2012, principally reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower television programming costs and the benefit from the nonrenewal of an unprofitable sports programming contract. Restructuring charges of $8 million in 2012 reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. 

Transactions

In December 2014, the Company completed a radio station swap with Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. through which the Company exchanged 13 of its radio stations in Tampa and Charlotte as well as one radio station in Philadelphia, for two radio stations in Philadelphia and three radio stations in Miami. In connection with the radio station swap, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $52 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. 

During 2012, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $11 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill in connection with the disposition of the Company’s radio stations in West Palm Beach. 

Corporate

Corporate expenses include general corporate overhead, unallocated shared company expenses, pension and postretirement benefit costs for plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses, and intercompany eliminations. For 2014, corporate expenses decreased 17% to $298 million from $358 million for 2013 and for 2013, increased 13% from $316 million for 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the Company's stock price on stock-based compensation. The increase in 2013 was partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit costs, reflecting the benefit from pre-funding pension plans in 2012 and the favorable performance of pension plan assets.

Financial Position

Current assets increased by $219 million to $5.59 billion at December 31, 2014 from $5.37 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in receivables associated with the licensing of television programming; an increase in programming inventory, primarily reflecting the timing of payments under the Company's agreement with the NFL for Sunday football; and an increase in prepaid income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $351 million decrease in current assets of discontinued operations resulting from the Split-Off of Outdoor Americas in the third quarter of 2014. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 1.4% at December 31, 2014 compared with 1.8% at December 31, 2013, primarily due to the increase in receivables relating to television licensing agreements, which have historically had a low rate of uncollectability, as well as improved collections.

II-19

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Assets held for sale at December 31, 2013 included the property and equipment, goodwill, and FCC licenses disposed of in the radio station swap with Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc.

Other assets increased by $525 million to $2.49 billion at December 31, 2014 from $1.96 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting higher long-term receivables associated with additional revenues from long-term television licensing arrangements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. As of December 31, 2014, total outstanding receivables from licensing arrangements, including both current and noncurrent, were $3.57 billion versus $3.14 billion at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.56 billion in 2015, $1.00 billion in 2016, $531 million in 2017, $245 million in 2018, and $231 million in 2019 and thereafter. 

Current liabilities decreased by $174 million to $4.03 billion at December 31, 2014 from $4.21 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily driven by a decrease in current liabilities of discontinued operations resulting from the Split-Off of Outdoor Americas in the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by an increase in commercial paper borrowings.

Pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased by $237 million to $1.56 billion at December 31, 2014 from $1.33 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the favorable performance of pension plan assets.

The decreases in long-term assets and long-term liabilities of discontinued operations of $3.09 billion and $359 million, respectively, reflect the Split-Off of Outdoor Americas in the third quarter of 2014.

Cash Flows

The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities. In 2014, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $1.21 billion from $1.78 billion in 2013 reflecting higher payments for interest, as 2014 included payments of $360 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for early redemption premiums. The decrease in operating cash flows also reflects the benefit to 2013 from CBS's Super Bowl broadcast and the timing of payments for sports programming. These declines were partially offset by contributions of $150 million in 2013 to prefund the Company's qualified pension plans, with no comparable amount in 2014, as well as higher collections from television licensing agreements. 

II-20

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In 2013, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $274 million to $1.78 billion from $1.51 billion in 2012 primarily reflecting growth in operating income, the benefit from the 2013 Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network and lower payments for interest. Cash interest payments for 2012 included approximately $60 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for early redemption premiums. The increase from operating income was partially offset by an increase in receivables from the licensing of television programming, driven by the timing difference between revenue recognition and collections for long term television licensing arrangements. Revenues from the licensing of television programming are recognized when the television series is made available to the licensee, at the beginning of the applicable license period, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. 

Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations was $217 million for 2014, $294 million for 2013 and $331 million for 2012. These amounts are net of excess tax benefits for the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units of $243 million, $148 million, and $103 million, respectively, which are presented in cash flows from financing activities. Cash taxes included in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations were $460 million in 2014, $442 million in 2013 and $434 million in 2012. 

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations decreased $29 million to $65 million in 2014 from $94 million in 2013 and for 2013 decreased $216 million from $310 million for 2012. Included in 2013 was a payment of $171 million associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement in connection with the sale of Outdoor Europe.

Investing Activities. In 2014, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $316 million principally reflects capital expenditures of $206 million and investments in investee companies of $98 million, mainly for the Company’s investment in The CW as well as its other domestic and international television joint ventures. In 2013, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $214 million principally reflects capital expenditures of $212 million and investments in investee companies of $176 million, mainly for the Company’s initial investment in POP (formerly known as TVGN, TV Guide Network) as well as its other domestic and international television joint ventures. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from dispositions of $164 million, principally from the sale of Outdoor Europe. In 2012, cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $375 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $200 million and acquisitions of $146 million, primarily for television and radio stations.

Capital expenditures for 2015 are anticipated to be at a similar level to 2014.

Cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations of $285 million for 2014 principally reflects the disposition of Outdoor Americas' cash as well as the capital expenditures of Outdoor Americas. Cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations for 2013 and 2012 of $58 million and $76 million, respectively, primarily reflects the capital expenditures of Outdoor Americas and for 2012 also includes the capital expenditures of Outdoor Europe.

Financing Activities. In 2014, cash used for financing activities from continuing operations of $2.81 billion principally reflects the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $3.60 billion and the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.15 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $1.73 billion. For 2013, cash used for financing activities of $1.91 billion principally reflected the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $2.19 billion, partially offset by proceeds from short-term borrowings of $475 million. For 2012, cash used for financing activities of $1.32 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.58 billion and the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.14 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.57 billion.

II-21

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations of $2.17 billion in 2014 principally reflects the net proceeds from Outdoor Americas' long-term debt borrowing and IPO.

Dividends

During the third quarter of 2014, the Company announced an increase to its quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock of 25% from $.12 per share to $.15 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company declared per share dividends of $.54, $.48, and $.44, respectively, which resulted in total annual dividends of $296 million, $295 million and $287 million, respectively. 

On January 30, 2015, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2015. 

Share Repurchase Program

During 2014, the Company repurchased 60.3 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock under its share repurchase program for $3.61 billion, at an average cost of $59.88 per share. At December 31, 2014, $4.80 billion of authorization remained under the share repurchase program.

Also during 2014, the Company completed the Split-Off through which it received 44.7 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock in exchange for the 97.0 million shares of Outdoor Americas common stock that it owned (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company expects to spend approximately $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock.

Capital Structure

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $21 million and $13 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $14 million and $18 million, respectively. The face value of the Company’s total debt was $7.15 billion at December 31, 2014 and $6.44 billion at December 31, 2013.

(b) Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For the year ended December 31, 2014, debt issuances, redemptions and repurchases were as follows:

Debt Issuances

August 2014, $600 million 2.30% senior notes due 2019

August 2014, $600 million 3.70% senior notes due 2024 

August 2014, $550 million 4.90% senior notes due 2044 

Debt Redemptions

$99 million 8.875% notes due 2014

$264 million 8.875% senior notes due 2019

Debt Repurchases

$336 million 8.875% senior notes due 2019, through a tender offer

$37 million 7.875% debentures due 2023, through a tender offer

$6 million 7.125% senior notes due 2023, through a tender offer

$423 million 7.875% senior debentures due 2030, through a tender offer

The debt repurchases and early debt redemption resulted in a pretax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million ($219 million, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2014.

During January 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2025 and $600 million of 4.60% senior notes due 2045. The 2015 debt issuances and 2014 debt refinancing activity are expected to result in an annualized net increase to interest expense of approximately $15 million.

All of the Company’s long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2014, in connection with the issuance of its $600 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2019, the Company entered into $600 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements to hedge this debt. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).

At December 31, 2014, the Company’s scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial Paper

The Company had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its commercial paper program of $616 million and $475 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.46% and 0.28%, respectively and with maturities of less than forty-five days. During December 2014, the Company increased its commercial paper program from $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. 

Credit Facility

During December 2014, the Company amended and restated its revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to increase the capacity from $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion and extend the expiration to December 2019. The provisions of the Credit Facility are substantially similar to those under the Company's previous credit facility. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing 

II-23

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company’s option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.1x.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company’s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.

The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2014, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.49 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company’s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company’s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $2.49 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2014, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

The Company’s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for the Company’s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $1.50 billion is expected to come from the Company’s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $4.80 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded over time by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

During January of 2015, the Company issued $1.20 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds for the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2014 payments due by period under the Company's significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $10.23 billion for sports programming rights, $2.70 billion relating to the production and licensing of television, radio, and film programming, and $797 million for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding capital leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases.

(f) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals.

The table above excludes $140 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation. The table above also excludes principal and interest payments relating to the Company's issuance of $1.20 billion of senior notes in January 2015.

In 2015, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $50 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2015, the Company expects to contribute approximately $58 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company’s portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

Guarantees

On September 30, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Outdoor Europe to an affiliate of Platinum Equity. The Company continues to remain as guarantor of certain of Outdoor Europe’s obligations, including franchise payment obligations under certain transit franchise agreements. Generally, the Company would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-performance by the buyer. These agreements have varying terms, with the majority of the obligations guaranteed under these agreements expiring by September 2016. At December 31, 2014, the total franchise payment obligations under these agreements are estimated to be approximately $187 million, which will decrease on a monthly basis thereafter. The carrying value of the guarantee liability of approximately $28 million and $40 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in “Liabilities of discontinued operations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2014, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $242 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Programming and Production Costs

Accounting for the Company's television production costs requires management’s judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Management’s judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program.

Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test.

Goodwill—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. For 2014, the Company performed qualitative assessments for five reporting units which management estimates each have fair values that exceed their respective carrying values by 20% or more. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units. Based on this qualitative assessment, considering the aggregation of these factors, the Company concluded that for these five reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and therefore performing the two-step impairment test was unnecessary.

The Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the remaining two reporting units. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). For 2014, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market or a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Based on the 2014 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the fair value of each of the two reporting units for which the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test exceeded their respective carrying values. The carrying value of the following reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $1.86 billion at December 31, 2014, was within 10% of its estimated fair value:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

An increase to the discount rate of 35 basis points or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rate of 45 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value of the CBS Radio reporting unit to fall below its carrying value.

FCC Licenses—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company’s radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use.

For its annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company performed qualitative assessments for five radio markets and ten television markets which management estimates each have an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that exceed their respective carrying values by 20% or more. For each market, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on this qualitative assessment, considering the aggregation of these factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the aggregate fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these radio and television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For each of the remaining radio and television markets the Company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up station, the total market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2014 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The assumptions used in determining the fair values of the FCC licenses require management to make significant judgments. Certain events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital or a decline in the local radio or television advertising markets, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television and radio stations. Deterioration in the economic conditions or a change in population size of any individual geographic market could adversely impact advertisers’ ability or willingness to purchase advertising on the radio and television stations in that market. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain industries, including automotive, entertainment and retail, have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues in all geographic markets. As a result, an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in these categories or adverse economic conditions, particularly in larger markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, where the Company holds FCC licenses with substantial carrying values, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the FCC licenses.

Based on the 2014 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses in each radio and television market for which the Company performed the quantitative assessment exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. Three radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $729 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and eight radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $1.30 billion, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. In addition, one television market, which had a carrying value of FCC licenses of $167 million, was within 10% of its estimated fair value. In each of the remaining radio and television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values by more than 10%. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Reserves and Legal Matters

Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company’s pension plan’s expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2014, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased from the prior year end due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate partially offset by the favorable performance of pension plan assets. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $120 million and will not have a material impact on the 2014 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $10 million to 2015 pension expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized tax benefits of $7 million and $17 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $140 million at December 31, 2014 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

Legal Matters 

General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, ‘‘litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named. 

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product 

II-30

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had pending approximately 41,100 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 45,150 as of December 31, 2013 and 45,900 as of December 31, 2012. During 2014, the Company received approximately 3,880 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 7,930 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company’s total costs for the years 2014 and 2013 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $11 million and $29 million, respectively. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. 

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to modify this exposure. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian 

II-31

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $152 million and $136 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.

Interest Risk

All of the Company’s long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2014, in connection with the issuance of its $600 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2019, the Company entered into $600 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements to hedge this debt. The fair value of interest rate swaps is included within the carrying value of the debt attributable to the risk being hedged, and in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps are recognized within interest expense. The swaps expose the Company to movements in short-term interest rates. Based on the amount of fixed-to-floating rate swaps at December 31, 2014, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $6 million change to pretax earnings.

Credit Risk

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2014 or 2013, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.
