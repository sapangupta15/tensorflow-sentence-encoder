Item 1A. Risk Factors  

This report contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect us. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. The cautionary statements made under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report are intended to be applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they may appear in this report. We urge you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.  

Risks Relating to our Business  

The continuing worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Market acceptance of our medical products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding world financial markets and continuing weak worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of actual or potential debt default by certain European countries, have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums and co-payments may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists, which in turn would adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Job losses or slow improvement in the unemployment rate in the U.S. as a result of current macroeconomic conditions may result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer health group and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying Medicare and Medicaid programs. Furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. If the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.

Sales and market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payors. The failure of third-party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.  

Sales and market acceptance of our medical products and the treatments facilitated by our products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our products and treatments has and will continue to depend upon our customers ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from third-party payors for, these products and treatments.  

Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures are being adopted in the United States and in many foreign countries. These reforms and measures, including those envisioned by the adoption in 2010 of United States healthcare reform, could among other things limit the use of our products and treatments and further reduce reimbursement available for such use. In addition, the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect could have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Significant reductions in reimbursement rates proposed or implemented for the use of any our products have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the sales of those products. We also expect that pricing of medical products and services will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations begin to take shape in the United States.  

Currently, there is not an established CPT code, reimbursement rate or official coverage for the use of 3D mammography (breast tomosynthesis). We are working with governmental authorities, professional societies, healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in efforts to secure reimbursement for the use of 3D mammography. However, we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, adequate reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis would adversely affect sales of our Dimensions 3D systems.  

The adoption of healthcare reform in the United States and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of these reforms could harm our business and prospects.  

The healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. The effect of the implementation of the PPACA on our business is uncertain. Among other things, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices which became effective on January 1, 2013. We expect that this excise tax will continue to apply to the majority, if not all, of our products sold in the U.S. in which net product sales represent, and will likely continue to represent a substantial majority of our net revenues. In addition, the judgments we make regarding which of our products are subject to the excise tax based on our interpretations of this act and IRS regulations and the underlying factors used to calculate the amount of tax due on the sale of such products could differ from the IRS, resulting in additional charges to our results of operations. Our U.S. product sales represented 74% and 73% of our net product sales for the years ended September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively. Since the effective date of the medical device excise tax through September 28, 2013, the Company has incurred $15.7 million of excise tax expense related to the domestic sales of its medical device products.  

The law also includes new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, as well as stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and hospitals. We expect compliance with the new healthcare legislation, including with these new reporting requirements and the new excise tax, to impose significant additional administrative and financial burdens on us. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The healthcare reform  

27  

Table of Contents 

 legislation and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. These reforms include a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. In addition, the excise tax will increase our costs of doing business. The impact of this healthcare reform legislation, and practices including price regulation, competitive pricing, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed care arrangements could harm our business and prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could:  

       limit the use of our products and treatments;  

       reduce reimbursement available for such use;  

       further tax the sale or use of our products;  

       adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted; and  

       further increase the administrative and financial burden of compliance.  

These reforms, cost containment measures and new taxes, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.  

Changes in laws affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  

We operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:  

       new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services;  

       changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and treatments and result in lost market opportunity;  

       changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products and treatments to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or treatments, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; and  

       new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.  

We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may cause increased compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.  

Guidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations may reduce the use of our products.  

Professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. Recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by healthcare providers and insurers could result in  

28  

Table of Contents 

 decreased use of our products. For example, in November 2012, the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, known as the ACOG, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in March 2012 by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, known as the USPSTF, and the American Cancer Society. We believe that these recommendations and guidelines may have contributed to increased screeing intervals for cervical cancer, which we believe has and may continue to adversely affect our ThinPrep revenues.  

Our long-term success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and treatments and enhance our existing products and treatments.  

We are devoting significant resources to our continuing research and development programs which are designed to develop new products and treatments and to enhance and improve our existing products and treatments. The successful development of our products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       unanticipated delays in development, clinical trials or the approval or clearance process by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority;  

       access to capital;  

       budget overruns;  

       third-party intellectual property;  

       technical problems; and  

       other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the FDA in connection with pre-market approval applications for products or 510(k) clearance.  

Given the uncertainties inherent with product development, introduction, and enhancement our efforts may not be completed on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget, if at all, could harm our business and prospects.  

Our blood screening business, which we conduct through our collaboration agreement with Novartis, could be adversely affected by the recently announced proposed sale by Novartis of its blood screening business to Grifols.  

Product sales from our blood screening collaboration with Novartis accounted for 16.6% of our Diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2013. Under that collaboration our blood screening products have been marketed and sold by Novartis. On November 11, 2013, Novartis announced that it is selling its blood screening business to Grifols. Grifols had previously been a customer of our collaboration with Novartis. As announced, the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2014. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, Grifols will replace Novartis as our blood screening collaborator. Novartis has significantly greater resources and worldwide name recognition than Grifols. A disruption of our blood screening business, including a loss of customers as a result of the announcement or transfer of Novartis blood screening business to Grifols, Grifols failure to market and sell our blood screening products successfully, or our and Grifols failure to otherwise manage our mutual collaboration successfully could adversely affect our Diagnostics segment revenues and profitability.

If we cannot maintain our current corporate collaborations and enter into new corporate collaborations, our product development could be delayed. In particular, any failure by us to successfully maintain our blood screening collaboration could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

We have historically entered into various corporate collaborations, including alliances and joint ventures, with certain partners or companies that could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Moreover, we may not be able to:  

       identify appropriate candidates for corporate collaborations;  

       assure that any collaboration candidate will provide us with the support we anticipated;  

       successfully negotiate a collaboration on terms that are advantageous to us; or  

       successfully manage any collaboration.  

Gen-Probe has relied, to a significant extent, on corporate collaborators for funding the development of and marketing for certain of its products. In addition, we expect to rely on our corporate collaborators for the commercialization of certain products. If any of our corporate collaborators were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner, the development or commercialization and subsequent marketing of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources our corporate collaborators devote to our programs or potential products.  

The continuation of any of these collaboration agreements depends upon their periodic renewal by us and our collaborators. For example, in January 2009, Gen-Probe extended the term of its blood screening collaboration with Novartis to June 30, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances specified in the collaboration agreement. The collaboration was previously scheduled to expire by its terms in 2013. Most recently, on November 11, 2013, Novartis announced that it was selling its blood screening business to Grifols. Although Grifols had previously been a customer of our collaboration with Novartis, we have not previously collaborated with Grifols and we cannot assure that we and Grifols will be able to manage or continue a successful blood screening collaboration.  

If any of our current collaboration agreements are terminated, or if we are unable to renew those collaborations on acceptable terms, we may be required to devote additional internal resources to product development or marketing or to terminate some development programs or seek alternative corporate collaborations. In addition, in the event of a dispute under our current or any future collaboration agreements, such as our collaboration agreement with Novartis, which will be assigned to Grifols upon completion of Novartis proposed sale of its blood screening business to Grifols, a court or arbitrator may not rule in our favor and our rights or obligations under an agreement subject to a dispute may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse effect on our business or operating results. Any corporate collaboration may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous corporate collaboration, failing to manage a collaboration effectively, or failing to comply with the obligations associated with a collaboration, could harm our business and prospects.  

If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory and quality requirements, our ability to sell our products will be harmed.  

The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities. These difficulties have primarily related to delays and difficulties associated with ramping up production of newly introduced products and may result in increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. In addition,  

30  

Table of Contents 

 production of these newer products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise, which we may be unable to develop. Our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.  

In determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we and our distributors require, which could harm our business and results of operations.  

Blood screening, medical diagnostic and surgical device products are regulated by the FDA as well as other foreign medical regulatory bodies. In some cases, such as in the United States and the EU, certain products may also require individual lot release testing. Maintaining compliance with multiple regulators, and multiple centers within the FDA, adds complexity and cost to our manufacturing processes. In addition, our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, and these facilities are subject to FDA requirements relating to the Quality System Regulation and Good Manufacturing Practices. We or our contractors may fail to satisfy these regulatory requirements in the future, and any failure to do so may prevent us from selling our products.  

Our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet applicable specifications.  

We are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. Our existing and newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet applicable specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity, mandatory or voluntary recalls or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products may be subject to recalls even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which could harm our reputation, business and prospects.  

The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of medical products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall could divert managerial and financial resources, be difficult and costly to correct, result in the suspension of sales of certain of our products, harm our reputation and the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.  

Interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.  

We and our contract manufacturers manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Our manufacturing facilities may experience  

plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment  

31  

Table of Contents 

 failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could harm our business and prospects. Because some of our manufacturing operations are located outside the United States, including in Germany, Canada, Costa Rica, the United Kingdom and China, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described below.  

Our inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products and treatments or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.  

Our products and treatments are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. Our inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary United States or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.  

Medical devices cannot be marketed in the United States without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties.  

Medical devices sold in the United States must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.  

Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability. In August 2010, the FDA issued two reports outlining potential changes to the 510(k) regulatory process. In addition, in January 2011, the FDA issued an implementation plan containing 25 specific actions to be implemented in 2011 relating to the 510(k) regulatory process and associated administrative matters. The FDA also deferred action on several other initiatives, including the creation of a new class of devices that would be subject to heightened review processes, until the Institute of Medicine released a related report on the 510(k) regulatory process in July 2011. The FDA is reviewing the Institute of Medicines report as well as public input to determine what, if any, recommendations the FDA will adopt with respect to the 510(k) regulatory process. Many of the actions proposed by the FDA could result in significant changes to the 510(k) regulatory process, which would likely complicate the process of obtaining product clearance from the FDA. In September 2012, the European Commission proposed new regulations for medical devices. The proposed new regulations cover in one regulation devices that are currently the subject of two separate directives, the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive and the Medical Devices Directive. The adoption of these regulations may impact our international operations through a broadened scope of medical device oversight and/or regulatory reach. Compliance with the new European Commission regulations, if and when adopted, may impose additional administrative and financial burdens on us.

The markets for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected.  

The successful commercialization of our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:  

       uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;  

       trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;  

       the perception of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;  

       recommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers;  

       the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;  

       competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and  

       other technological developments.  

Often, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not established until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment.  

If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments our business and prospects could be harmed.  

The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products may not develop as expected.  

The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products may not continue to develop as expected. There is a significant installed base of conventional digital and screen-film mammography products in hospitals and radiological practices. The use of our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x-ray imaging equipment. As our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis systems are generally more expensive than conventional mammography products, we believe that a major factor in the markets acceptance of Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis systems has been and will continue to be based upon the benefits of tomosynthesis as compared to less expensive technologies. Moreover, as a new technology, there is currently limited, if any, reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We believe that our ability to continue to gain market acceptance of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and follow-on products depends on our ability to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and to secure reimbursement to support the use of 3D tomosynthesis. We are working with healthcare providers, insurance companies and other third-party payors in connection with our efforts to promote, and to secure reimbursement for, the use of 3D tomosynthesis. However, we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful. The markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products have and will  

33  

Table of Contents 

 continue to be affected by published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of tomosynthesis, as well as decisions relating to the reimbursement of healthcare providers for the use of the system. The publication of an adverse study, or an adverse decision relating to the reimbursement of the use of tomosynthesis, would likely significantly impair the adoption of this technology and harm our business. Sales of our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system may also be adversely affected by increased competition. Several companies, including Siemens, I.M.S., Fuji, and Philips have recently introduced 3D tomosynthesis systems in certain foreign countries. We also are aware that other companies, several of which have substantially greater resources than we have, such as GE, Siemens and Fuji, are developing 3D tomosynthesis systems for approval in the U.S. Because the markets for our Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system and related products are relatively new, it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time.  

Our business may be harmed by the acquisition of Gen-Probe, our other prior acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.  

We have acquired a number of businesses, technologies, product lines and products, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete acquisition transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further, the long-term success of our acquisitions and any additional acquisitions we may complete in the future will depend upon our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. We may fail to realize anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:  

       problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:  

       diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;  

       failure to retain and motivate key employees;  

       failure to successfully oversee international sales efforts and inability to prevent FCPA violations;  

       failure to successfully obtain appropriate regulatory approval or clearance for products under development;  

       failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;  

       failure of customers to accept new products;  

       failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;  

       failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;  

       failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;  

       potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;  

       potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems;  

       potential difficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the SEC; and  

       potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition of such  

34  

Table of Contents 

     companies, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;  

       we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;  

       an acquisition may result in future impairment charges related to a decline in the fair value of the acquired business as compared to the price we paid for such acquisition;  

       an acquisition may involve restructuring operations or reductions in workforce which may result in substantial charges to our operations;  

       our current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with an acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business;  

       an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by shareholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;  

       an acquisition may involve significant deferred or contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources; and  

       the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax decisions and/or changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.  

Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from combining acquired businesses could harm our business and prospects.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, in connection with our Company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure, we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit, which is in our Diagnostics segment. The Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our Aptima business acquired in the Gen-Probe acquisition in fiscal 2012 and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the Third Wave acquisition in fiscal 2008. The updated forecast, which reflects recent pricing pressures, is now lower, and the current projections for revenue and profitability are lower than those expected at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. As such, the fair value of this reporting unit declined. As a result of performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the completion of a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of the implied goodwill, we recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. For further information of this charge, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or other obligations, or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.  

Our business may be harmed by the contingent earn out obligations we incurred in connection with our acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.  

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earn out payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period. We also expect that acquisitions we may complete in the future may contain contingent earn out  

35  

Table of Contents 

 payments, and these payments could be significant. In certain circumstances, such as a change of control, a portion of these obligations may be accelerated. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn out obligations may include covenants to operate the acquired businesses in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us. These provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. Our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances giving rise to the payment and our previous estimates, all or a portion of these payments may be required to be expensed by us when accrued. We can give no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to pay our contingent obligations when due, or that such obligations, including the associated covenants relating to the operation of the acquired business, will not otherwise adversely affect our business, liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.  

It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for sustaining growth.  

Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining. For example, in fiscal 2013, we experienced declines in domestic sales of our ThinPrep and NovaSure systems, and worldwide sales of our 2D mammography systems. We attribute the decline in ThinPrep system sales to the increased time intervals between cervical cancer screenings as a result of recent screening recommendations, the decline in the sale of NovaSure systems to the continuing effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty and the increase in insurance deductibles and the availability of less expensive, although often less effective, alternative therapies, and the decline in 2D mammography sales to our introduction of the Dimensions 3D tomosynthesis system. At the end of fiscal 2013, we also experienced a modest decline in prices for our molecular diagnostics products. We also continue to experience pressures resulting from ongong economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from health care reforms, reimbursement pressures and capital budget uncertainty. We expect such trends and pressures to continue in fiscal 2014.  

To offset these pressures, we are pursuing a number of strategies to sustain our business, including:  

       continuing to aggressively place our molecular diagnostics instrumentation in laboratories, particular our Panther system, to drive longer term growth from the use of those systems and the purchase of our assays;  

       continuing to aggressively market and sell our Dimenstions 3D tomosynthesis system and to seek incremental reimbursement for the use of 3D tomosynthesis;  

       expanding our product offerings, particularly within our Diagnostics segment;  

       allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;  

       developing new applications for our technologies;  

       strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;  

       implementing targeted customer initiatives; and  

       supporting cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of the breadth of our product offerings.  

We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business.

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could harm our business and prospects.  

The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals and clinical laboratories. This consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition and continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, we are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the United States for a significant portion of our sales of diagnostics products. Due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest United States laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories.  

Our business is dependent on technologies we license, and if we fail to maintain these licenses or license new technologies and rights to particular nucleic acid sequences for targeted diseases in the future, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.  

Our business is dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. For example, our patented TMA technology is based on technology we licensed from Stanford University. In addition, we have acquired exclusive worldwide diagnostic rights to the PCA3 gene from DiagnoCure, Inc. We anticipate that we will enter into new licensing arrangements in the ordinary course of business to expand our product portfolio and access new technologies to enhance our products and develop new products. Many of these licenses will provide us with exclusive rights to the subject technology or disease marker. If our license with respect to any of these technologies or markers is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to sell products that incorporate the technology. Similarly, we may lose competitive advantages if we fail to maintain exclusivity under an exclusive license.  

Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued decisions, the full impact of which is not yet known. For example, in March 2012 in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. The decision appears to impact diagnostics patents that merely apply a law of nature via a series of routine steps and it has created uncertainty around the ability to patent certain biomarker-related method claims. Additionally, in June 2013 in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Court held that claims to isolated genomic DNA are not patentable, but claims to complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules were held to be valid. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain and we may lose competitive advantages should the subject matter of an exclusive license be deemed non-statutory and we therefore fail to maintain exclusivity to such subject matter as a result.  

Our ability to develop additional diagnostic tests for diseases may depend on the ability of third parties to discover particular sequences or markers and correlate them with disease, as well as the rate at which such discoveries are made. Our ability to design products that target these diseases may depend on our ability to obtain the necessary rights from the third parties that make any of these discoveries. In addition, there are a finite number of diseases and conditions for which our NAT diagnostic assays may be economically viable. If we are unable to access new technologies or the rights to particular sequences or markers necessary for additional diagnostic products on commercially reasonable terms, we may be limited in our ability to develop new diagnostic products.

Our products and manufacturing processes will require access to technologies and materials that may be subject to patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may need to obtain additional intellectual property rights in order to commercialize our products. We may be unable to obtain such rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.  

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.  

We have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, and copyrights to protect our products and technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe our intellectual property, or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. The pursuit and assertion of a patent right, particularly in areas like nucleic acid diagnostics and biotechnology, involve complex determinations and, therefore, are characterized by substantial uncertainty. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents that do issue will be challenged or invalidated. The patents that we own or license could also be subject to interference proceedings or similar disputes over the priority of the inventions, and an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to the technology from the prevailing party. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in biotechnology. As a result, patents might not issue from certain of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us.  

We have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our U.S. patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the U.S.  

The rights provided by a patent are finite in time. Over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the U.S. and abroad thus allowing third parties to utilize certain of our technologies.  

Our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. Even if our proprietary information is protected by patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. As a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.  

Additionally, the effect of the Prometheus Laboratories and Myriad Genetics decisions on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain and these decisions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  

Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.  

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device, diagnostic products and related industries. We are and have been involved in patent litigation, and may in the future be subject to further claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties.  

In connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will  

38  

Table of Contents 

 not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.  

Our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.  

We are subject to a number of additional risks and expenses due to our international operations, including our operations in China. Any of these risks or expenses could harm our operating results. These risks and expenses include:  

       difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;  

       protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;  

       difficulties in the collection of trade accounts receivable;  

       difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;  

       expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;  

       possible adverse tax consequences;  

       the inability to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements;  

       the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;  

       governmental currency controls;  

       multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements);  

       operation in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices;  

       reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  

       political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;  

       the inability to effectively obtain or enforce intellectual property rights and otherwise protect against clone or knock off products; and  

       the lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in China and other foreign countries.  

Our global operations are required to comply with the FCPA, Chinese anti-corruption and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions.  

Our China operations are subject to national, regional and local regulations. The regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. It is possible that the Chinese governments current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our China operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.

We utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.  

We rely on strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. For example, in our Diagnostics business we are dependent on Novartis to distribute the blood screening products we manufacture. Commercial blood screening product sales to Novartis accounted for 16.6% of our Diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2013. In January 2009, Gen-Probe extended the term of its blood screening collaboration with Novartis to June 30, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances specified in the collaboration agreement. On November 11, 2013, Novartis announced that it is selling its blood screening business to Grifols. As announced, the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2014. Upon the consummation of that transaction, Grifols will replace Novartis as our blood screening collaborator. If our blood screening relationship or any of our other strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. If any of our distribution or marketing agreements are terminated, particularly our blood screening collaboration agreement, or if we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales and marketing resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would significantly increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. We may not be able to enter into new distribution or marketing agreements on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into acceptable distribution or marketing agreements or fail to successfully market our products, our product sales will decrease. We may also be exposed to risks as a result of transitioning a territory from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers, hiring appropriately trained personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements, any of which could result in lower revenues than previously received from the distributor in that territory.  

Fluctuations in the exchange rates of European currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.  

We maintain sales and service offices outside the United States, have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Canada, China, Costa Rica, England and Germany, and conduct business worldwide. The expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies, except at our Costa Rica subsidiary, where the majority of business is conducted in U.S. dollars. Our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the Euro or U.S. dollar. Historically, a majority of our sales of capital equipment to international dealers have been denominated in U.S. dollars; however, in the second half of fiscal 2010 we began to invoice more of our European sales in the Euro.  

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency. In the last few years we have not hedged foreign currency exposures, but we may in the future hedge foreign currency denominated sales. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products. This reliance could harm our business and prospects.  

We rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials, components or subassemblies for our products. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. Any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales.

Our current supplier of certain key raw materials for certain of our amplified NAT diagnostic assays, pursuant to a fixed-price contract, is Roche Diagnostics Corporation. We have a supply and purchase agreement for oligonucleotides for HPV with Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. Each of these entities is an affiliate of Roche Diagnostics GmbH, which is one of our primary competitors in molecular diagnostics. We also have a supply agreement with an affiliate of GE for membranes used in connection with our ThinPrep product line. GE competes with us in our Breast Health and Skeletal Health businesses.  

We have only one third-party manufacturer for each of our molecular diagnostics instrument product lines, which exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.  

We have one third-party manufacturer for each of our molecular diagnostics instrument product lines. KMC Systems, Inc., or KMC Systems, is the only manufacturer of the Tigris instrument; Stratec Biomedical AG, or Stratec, is the only manufacturer of the Panther instrument; and Tecan Group Ltd., or Tecan, is the only manufacturer of the Cervista High Throughput Automation System. We are dependent on these third-party manufacturers, and this dependence exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.  

We have no firm long-term commitments from KMC Systems, Stratec or Tecan or any of our other contract manufacturers to supply products to us for any specific period, or in any specific quantity, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. If KMC Systems, Stratec, Tecan or any of our other third-party manufacturers experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its development or manufacturing operations or becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to supply us with products in sufficient quantities, then instrument shipments to our customers could be delayed, which would decrease our revenues and harm our competitive position and reputation. Further, because we place orders with our manufacturers based on forecasts of expected demand for our instruments, if we inaccurately forecast demand we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity or adequate quantities of components to meet our customers delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories.  

We may in the future need to find new contract manufacturers to replace existing suppliers, increase our volumes or reduce our costs. We may not be able to find contract manufacturers that meet our needs, and even if we do, qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming. If we are required or elect to change contract manufacturers, we may lose revenues and our customer relationships may suffer.  

We may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with our planned consolidation of operations and facilities that could materially harm our business and prospects.  

We continually review our operations and facilities in an effort to reduce costs and increase efficiencies and are currently still in the process of completing the consolidation of our Madison, Wisconsin molecular diagnostics operations into our Gen-Probe facilities in San Diego, California. We expect this consolidation to be completed in calendar 2014. During fiscal 2013, we moved our selenium panel coating production line into our digital detector manufacturing facility in Newark, Delaware from Germany, and have completed the majority of consolidation of our breast biopsy operations, including manufacturing, research and development and sales support to our Costa Rica manufacturing facility and facilities in Massachusetts. Our breast biopsy operations consolidation is expected to be completed at or near the end of calendar 2013. Uncertainty is inherent within the consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances, costs and expenses could offset the anticipated benefits, disrupt operations, including the timely delivery of products and service to customers, and impact product quality, which could materially harm our business and prospects. In addition, we may fail to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and who we depend upon for the timely and successful transition, we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers at the new locations to handle the additional production and other demands, and the relocation may absorb significant management and key employee attention and resources. If any of these risks materialize, our business, result of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.

We face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.  

A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. In addition, some companies may have significant competitive advantages over us, which may make them more attractive to hospitals, radiology clients, group purchasing organization, laboratories, and physicians, including:  

       greater brand recognition;  

       larger or more established distribution networks and customer bases;  

       a broader product portfolio, resulting in the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;  

       higher levels of automation and greater installed bases of such equipment;  

       more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities and greater financial resources; and  

       greater technical resources positioning them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.  

The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, and these competitive pressures may reduce our gross margins. Other companies may develop products that are superior to and/or less expensive than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introduction of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.  

The current environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, together with current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures, may put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes.  

If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative products and treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.  

Our Diagnostics segment depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its product sales, the loss of any of these customers or any cancellation or delay of a large purchase by any of these customers could significantly reduce revenues in our Diagnostics segment.  

Although we do not currently have any customers that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, a material portion of product sales in our Diagnostics segment comes from a limited number of customers. We do not have any long-term commitments with these Diagnostics customers, other than pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Novartis. On November 11, 2013, Novartis announced that it is selling its blood screening business to Grifols. Upon the consummation of that transaction, Grifols will replace Novartis as our blood screening collaborator. Product sales from our blood screening collaboration accounted for 16.6% of our Diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2013. Our blood screening collaboration is largely dependent on two significant customers in the United States, The American Red Cross and Creative Testing Solutions, although we do not receive any revenues directly from those entities. We anticipate that our operating results in our Diagnostics segment will continue to depend, to a significant extent, upon revenues from a small number of customers. The loss of any of these key customers, or a significant reduction in sales volume or pricing to these customers, could significantly reduce our Diagnostics segment revenues or profitability.

Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.  

The markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. These trends will likely continue into the foreseeable future. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasingly challenging customer requirements and gain market acceptance. If we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.  

We will likely continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may reduce our profitability.  

Historically, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the development and improvement of our products and technologies. We expect that research and development expenditures will remain high as we seek to expand our product offerings and continue to develop and improve products and technologies. As a result, we will need to continue to generate significant revenues to maintain current levels of profitability. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to maintain current levels of profitability in the future.  

Our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation.  

Our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:  

       the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;  

       the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;  

       the development status and demand for our products;  

       the development status and demand for therapies to treat the health concerns addressed by our products and treatments;  

       economic conditions in our markets;  

       foreign exchange rates;  

       the timing of orders;  

       the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;  

       the mix of products we sell and markets we serve;  

       regulatory approval of products;  

       the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       pricing and other competitive conditions;  

       unanticipated expenses;  

       complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP;  

       asset impairments;  

       contingent consideration charges;  

       restructuring and consolidation charges; and  

       seasonality of sales of certain of our products.  

43  

Table of Contents 

Customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.  

Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false or fraudulent claims.  

We are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the anti-kickback statute, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. Similarly, our international operations are subject to the provisions of the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. In addition to the FCPA, our international operations are also subject to various other international anti-bribery laws such as the UK Anti-Bribery Act. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. However, despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents, or employees or agents of businesses or operations we may acquire. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also could be subject to adverse publicity, severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions. Moreover, our failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, and withdrawal of an approved product from the market.  

Failure to comply with laws relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, may require us to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.  

State, federal and foreign laws, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released. These measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving submission of claims to third party payors. These standards also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. In addition, under the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which was passed in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to  

44  

Table of Contents 

 federal HIPAA privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses may be deemed to serve as business associates to certain of our customers. On January 17, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule implementing the HITECH Act and making certain other changes to HIPAA privacy and security requirements. Compliance with the rule will increase the requirements applicable to some of our businesses. Failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.  

New regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.  

On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The new rule, which is effective for calendar 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31, 2014, will require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.  

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.  

In the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any such compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our computer systems, none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.  

We are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products.  

Our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and  

45  

Table of Contents 

 exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that products competitive position in the market.  

The sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, inaccurate test results or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of managements attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, and could harm our business and prospects.  

We use hazardous materials and products.  

Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture. This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan and China and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials. These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects. We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities. We are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.  

We may incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage.  

Our insurance coverage includes product liability, property, fire, terrorism and business interruption policies. Our insurance coverage contains policy limits, specifications and exclusions. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. Nonetheless, we may incur losses of a type for which we are not covered by insurance or which exceed the limits of liability of our insurance policies. In that event, we could experience a significant loss which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.  

Our future success depends on the continued services of key personnel.  

The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or strategic objectives. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial  

46

 and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel, particularly software engineers and other technical personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.  

Our ongoing organizational and strategic changes review and any changes resulting from that review could harm our business if not effectively managed.  

We are undertaking a review of our organizational structure and business strategies. Our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and strategic partners could be adversely affected by this transition. If we fail to effectively manage our leadership change, including any ongoing organizational and strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed.  

An adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate, including the continuation of the current financial and economic uncertainty, could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.  

At least annually, we review the carrying value of our goodwill, and for other long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. Conditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate an evaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. In addition, the deterioration of a companys market capitalization significantly below its net book value is an indicator of impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates.  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, in connection with our Company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure, we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit, which is in our Diagnostics segment. The Molecular Diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our Aptima business acquired in the Gen-Probe acquisition in fiscal 2012 and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the Third Wave acquisition in fiscal 2008. The updated forecast, which reflects recent pricing pressures, is now lower, and the current projections for revenue and profitability are lower than those expected at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. As such, the fair value of this reporting unit declined. As a result of performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the completion of a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of the implied goodwill, we recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. For further information of this charge, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report.  

All of our other reporting units passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test in fiscal 2013. Although we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. It is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic uncertainty could negatively affect our anticipated future cash flows, or the discount rates used to value the cash flows for each reporting unit, to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test in fiscal 2014.  

Our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.  

We are subject to income taxes and non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In certain instances, we take certain income tax return positions and provide additional  

47  

Table of Contents 

 taxes if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will not withstand a tax authoritys challenge. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly evaluate the audits likely outcomes to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and tax reserves. However, we can give no assurance that we will accurately predict the audits outcomes, which could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition.  

Our effective tax rate may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic earnings mix and changes in tax laws or tax rulings. U.S. law makers are considering several U.S. corporate tax reform proposals including those that may reduce or eliminate U.S. income tax deferral on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminate tax incentives such as the domestic manufacturing deduction and research credits in exchange for a lower U.S. statutory tax rate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have a material impact on our business and operating results.  

Risks Relating to our Indebtedness  

We incurred significant indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of Gen-Probe, which will limit our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.  

As of September 28, 2013, we had approximately $4.96 billion aggregate principal of indebtedness. We also have other contractual obligations and deferred tax liabilities. This significant level of indebtedness and our other obligations may:  

       make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;  

       increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;  

       require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;  

       limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we participate;  

       place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  

       limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.  

In addition, the terms of our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants that are customary with these types of credit facilities, which are described in Note 5 Borrowings and Credit Arrangements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, we could default under the credit facilities, which could cause us to be unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facilities and may result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding indebtedness under the facilities. If the maturities were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment, and if we were unable to make additional borrowings under the facilities, we may not be able to make investments in our business to support our strategy or we may end up in bankruptcy proceedings, or other processes, in which our business would be negatively impacted. In addition, our shareholders could be adversely  

48  

Table of Contents 

 impacted as shareholder value could decrease to a point of limited return. Each scenario would result in significant negative implications to our liquidity and results of operations.  

Further, the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:  

       incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;  

       pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments;  

       make certain investments;  

       agree to payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries;  

       sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;  

       enter into transactions with our affiliates;  

       create liens;  

       designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;  

       consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; and  

       use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets.  

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt, including the Senior Notes. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default or a change of control, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.  

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.  

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  

Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we can give no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this occurs, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These alternative strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.  

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds from asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.

A significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.  

A significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. As of September 28, 2013, approximately $2.24 billion aggregate principal of our indebtedness, which represents the outstanding principal under our tranche A term loan facility and our tranche B term loan facility, was subject to floating interest rates. We currently have no hedging arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates.  

Risks Relating to our Common Stock  

Future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes.  

Any future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.  

In addition, the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of our convertible notes, or any common stock that note holders receive upon conversion of their notes.  

Future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.  

Future sales of our common stock, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In addition, we may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options or for other reasons.  

Provisions in our charter, bylaws, indebtedness and stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  

Our charter, bylaws, and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. Our indebtedness also contains provisions which either accelerate or require us to offer to repurchase the indebtedness at a premium upon a change of control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.

Our stock price is volatile.  

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:  

       new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;  

       announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;  

       published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;  

       quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;  

       general conditions in the worldwide economy;  

       our stock repurchase program;  

       announcements of technological innovations;  

       new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;  

       developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;  

       developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;  

       the implementation of healthcare reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future; and  

       the success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions.  

The price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of high-tech companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.  

Our previously announced stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.  

On November 11, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our outstanding common stock over the next three years. Under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase, from time-to-time, shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in the United States. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will be determined based upon our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the program. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness.
