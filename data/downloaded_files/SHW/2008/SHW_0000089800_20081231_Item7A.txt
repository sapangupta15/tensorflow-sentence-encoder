ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

 We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company had foreign currency option and forward contracts and commodity swaps outstanding at December 31, 2008 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency and commodities. Foreign currency option and forward contracts are described in detail in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 69 of our 2008 Annual Report. Commodity swaps are described in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 45 of our 2008 Annual Report. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency translation and commodity price fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction, commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
