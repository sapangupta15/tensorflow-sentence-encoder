Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Foreign Exchange: Our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the U.S. Dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. The effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. For the most part, our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency. This minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations. 

While our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-U.S. currency markets are the European Monetary Union (EMU), the United Kingdom, Japan, Brazil and Canada. As an integral part of our treasury operations, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest. In the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts. At December 31, 2009, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $900.7 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments. The majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from 5 to 455 days with an average duration under 90 days. 

In addition to hedging intercompany cash movement, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge U.S. Dollar commercial paper issued by our London treasury center, whose functional currency is the British Pound. At December 31, 2009, we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as we had no commercial paper outstanding. 

The forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. These risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. As a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. In using these contracts, we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk. To minimize counterparty risk, we only enter into these contracts with major well-known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating. 

These hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations. We have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. We periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value-at-risk computation. Value-at-risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments. The value-at-risk analysis we performed on our December 31, 2009 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. This overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action, if appropriate. 

Interest Rate Risk: Substantially all of our long-term debt is fixed rate debt and is not affected by changes in interest rates. In managing our day-to-day liquidity, we may issue commercial paper, borrow under our $2.5 billion credit facility or borrow under our uncommitted lines of credit. Interest on this debt is variable. Interest expense on our variable rate debt was approximately $13 million out of our total interest expense of $122.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 

Our $2.5 billion credit facility expires on June 23, 2011. Our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, RBS, Deutsche, Bank of America, Societe Generale and BBVA. We also include large regional banks in the U.S. such as US Bancorp, Northern Trust, PNC and Wells Fargo. We also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as BNP Paribas in France, Sumitomo in Japan, Intesa San Paolo in Italy, Scotia in Canada and ANZ in Australia. 

Several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions. Additionally, during the recent credit crisis, several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central 

32 

governments. In the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity, the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us. 

The holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount. The next date on which holders of our 2033 Notes and 2038 Notes can put the notes back to us for cash is June 2010 and the next date on which holders of our 2032 Notes can put the notes back to us for cash is July 2010. As we have done on prior occasions, we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date. If we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including our stock price, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. 

If the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put. Although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event. Additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. The extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. 

Even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to EBITDA ratio. If we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to interest expense. However, the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. If either our ratio of debt to EBITDA was to double or our ratio of EBITDA was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. Therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. 

Credit Risk: We provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients. Due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 3.1% of our revenue, and no other client accounted for more than 2.5% of our revenue for 2009. However, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. 

In many of our businesses, we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. We enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide. These commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers. While operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. In other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clientsÂ’ credit worthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. Further, in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. We have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients. However, this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn.
