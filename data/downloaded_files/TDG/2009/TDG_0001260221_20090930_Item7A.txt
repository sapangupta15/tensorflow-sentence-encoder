ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At September 30, 2009, we had borrowings under our senior secured credit facility of $780 million that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the CompanyÂ’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our senior secured credit facility by approximately $7.8 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2009. The weighted average interest rate on the $780 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility on September 30, 2009 was 2.3%.  

At September 30, 2009, we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our senior secured credit facility for fixed interest rates through March 23, 2011 for the notional amount of $300 million. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a liability of $7.8 million.  

The fair value of the $780 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loan approximated $749 million at September 30, 2009 based upon information provided to the Company from its agent under the credit facility. The fair value of the $575 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of such notes approximated $571 million at September 30, 2009 based upon quoted market rates.
