ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company” or “ITW”) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 58 countries. As of December 31, 2012, these businesses are internally reported as 40 operating segments to senior management. The Company’s 40 operating segments have been aggregated into the following seven external reportable segments: Transportation; Power Systems & Electronics; Industrial Packaging; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Polymers & Fluids; and All Other.

Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company’s decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company’s corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.

Management analyzes the Company's consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment's operating margin.

A key element of the Company’s business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company’s operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Company’s operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their businesses. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:

•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.

•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.

•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.

•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.

The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.

INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE

Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one-month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company now reports both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. Prior to this, the international fiscal reporting period began on December 1st and ended on November 30th. The Company applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial statement periods presented. Refer to the International Reporting Lag note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the international reporting change.

DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT

On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed joint venture, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Effective November 1, 2012, the Company made changes to its management reporting structure and Decorative Surfaces is no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. For businesses reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income, all related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.

STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT

On February 19, 2013, the Company announced that it is initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment, which may include a sale or spin-off of the business. The Company expects the review process will last through the remainder of 2013. 

2011 AND 2012 SEGMENT CHANGES

The Company periodically makes changes to its management reporting structure to better align its businesses with Company objectives and operating strategies. 

In the first quarter of 2011, the Company made certain changes in its management reporting structure that resulted in changes in some of the reportable segments. The pressure sensitive adhesives, and the static and contamination control reporting units were moved to the Power Systems & Electronics segment from the Polymers & Fluids and All Other segments, respectively. The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2011. 

In the first quarter of 2012, the Company made certain changes in its management reporting structure that resulted in changes in some of the reportable segments. These changes primarily related to the industrial fasteners reporting unit, formerly in the All Other segment, moving to the Transportation segment; certain businesses in a Latin American reporting unit, formerly in the Polymers & Fluids segment, moving to the Transportation segment; and a worldwide insulation reporting unit, formerly in the Industrial Packaging segment, moving to the Power Systems & Electronics segment. The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2012. 

The prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company’s consolidated results of operations for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

16

In 2012 and 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues increased 0.8% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation and the reduction of revenues due to divestitures. Base revenues increased 1.7% in 2012 versus 2011 as North American economic conditions were stronger than the European and Asia Pacific economic environments. North American base revenues increased 4.3% in 2012 versus 2011. International base revenues decreased 1.1% as Europe decreased 2.3% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily driven by weakness in Southern Europe. Asia Pacific base revenues increased 1.3% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to growth in India. Acquisitions contributed 3.1% to revenues primarily due to the purchase of a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids in the first quarter of 2012 and a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer purchased in the third quarter of 2011. Currency translation resulted in a 2.7% decline in revenues primarily due to a weaker Euro versus the year ago period. Divestitures reduced revenues by 1.4% primarily due to only ten months of operating results for the Decorative Surfaces segment in 2012 versus twelve months of operating results in 2011 as the Company divested a 51% interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment on October 31, 2012, and the segment was deconsolidated as of that date.

Revenues increased 15.4% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to higher base revenues, revenues from acquisitions, and the favorable impact of currency translation. Base revenues increased 7.5% in 2011 versus 2010 as worldwide economic conditions strengthened. North American and international base revenues increased 8.7% and 6.1%, respectively, in 2011 versus 2010. Base revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific increased 5.9% and 5.4%, respectively, in 2011 versus 2010; however, European economic conditions slowed in the second half of the year. End markets associated with welding, transportation and test and measurement businesses showed strength in 2011. Acquisitions contributed 4.9% to revenues primarily due to a North American automotive aftermarket business purchased in the first quarter of 2011, a South American chemical products manufacturer purchased in the fourth quarter of 2010, and a North American packaging business purchased in the second quarter of 2011. Currency translation resulted in a 3.1% increase in revenues primarily due to a stronger Euro and Australian dollar versus the year ago period. 

Operating Income

Operating income increased 4.2% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the positive operating leverage effects of the base revenue increase noted above and improved variable margins. Currency translation resulted in a 2.5% decline in operating income primarily due to a weaker Euro versus the year ago period. Higher restructuring expenses due to increased cost reduction activities also negatively impacted operating income by 1.9%. Base margins increased 110 basis points primarily due to improved variable margins and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues noted above. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs improved base margins 70 basis points primarily due to the favorable effect of selling 

17

price versus material cost comparisons of 50 basis points and benefits of restructuring projects. The increase in base margins was partially offset by a 40 basis point decline related to acquisitions, primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets. Restructuring expenses diluted total operating margins by 30 basis points primarily due to restructuring activities related to continued improvements in operating structure and efficiencies.

Operating income increased 21.2% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the positive operating leverage effects of the base revenue increase noted above, the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions, partially offset by weaker variable margins. Currency translation resulted in a 3.4% increase in operating income primarily due to a stronger Euro and Australian dollar versus the year ago period. Base margins increased 120 basis points due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 70 basis points, which was primarily due to the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 60 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 40 basis points primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues increased 3.1% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the increase in base business and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide automotive base revenues increased 9.4% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to an increase in worldwide auto builds of approximately 6%, favorable customer mix and product penetration gains in Europe, and growing product penetration with automotive original equipment manufacturers in China. The automotive aftermarket base business declined 4.1% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the loss of a major product line with a key customer and decreased demand for car care products in Europe, partially offset by higher demand in the U.S. Base revenues for the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business increased 4.0% over the prior year primarily due to strong energy development activity that increased consumer demand in North America. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a North American automotive aftermarket business in the first quarter of 2011 and a European automotive aftermarket business in the third quarter of 2011. 

19

Revenues increased 21.3% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base business, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide automotive base revenues increased 10.3% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to an increase in worldwide auto builds of 3% and improved product penetration in European and Asian markets. The truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business increased 19.7% over the prior year due to increased demand in North America and Canada related to oil and gas exploration. Automotive aftermarket base business increased 3.7% over the prior year. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a North American automotive aftermarket business in the first quarter of 2011. 

Operating Income

Operating income increased 3.8% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect of the base revenue increase noted above and income from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 50 basis points primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues described above, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Improvements in variable margins were primarily due to the favorable impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 40 basis points, which were more than offset by higher overhead costs of 60 basis points, including costs related to business expansion in China. The increase in total base margins was partially offset by a 20 basis point operating margin decline due to the higher restructuring expenses noted above. 

Operating income increased 26.2% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the positive operating leverage effects of the base revenue increase noted above, income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by lower variable margins and higher overhead costs. Base margins increased 110 basis points primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues described above, partially offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 80 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 30 basis points primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues increased 5.5% in 2012 versus 2011 due to growth in base business and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide welding base revenues increased 6.8% in 2012 versus 2011, but softened in the fourth quarter, as worldwide revenues declined 1.2% in the fourth quarter, largely due to an 11.7% decline in the international welding base business. North American welding base revenues increased 10.2% in 2012 versus 2011 due to growth in oil and gas end markets for the full year and increased sales to heavy equipment OEM's in the first half of 2012, with slowed growth in heavy equipment OEM demand in the second half of the year. Base revenues for the international welding businesses decreased 2.1% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to a weak Chinese shipbuilding end market, partially offset by growth in Asian and European oil and gas markets. Base revenues for the electronics businesses increased 0.5% mainly due to base revenue growth of 8.0% in the electronics assembly businesses driven by strong order rates from a key electronics customer, partially offset by a 4.1% decline in the other electronics businesses as consumer demand for basic cell phones and computers was weaker. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer in the third quarter of 2011. 

Revenues increased 18.7% in 2011 versus 2010 due to growth in base business, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Worldwide welding base revenues increased 19.5% in 2011 versus 2010. North American welding base revenues increased 22.4% due to improvements in a number of industrial-based end markets. In particular, increased sales in the oil and gas end market as well as sales to heavy equipment OEM’s and other manufacturers helped drive base revenues. Base revenues for the international welding businesses increased 11.9% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to growth in European and Asian oil and gas and infrastructure-related end markets. Base revenues for the electronics businesses increased 1.3% mainly due to base revenue growth of 6.3% in the electronics assembly businesses, though end markets significantly slowed for these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2011. Base revenues for the other electronics businesses decreased 1.3% due to weakening end markets and softer consumer demand. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer in the third quarter of 2011 and an automated welding systems business in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 6.2% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the growth in base revenues and improved variable margins, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses due to increased cost reduction activities and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base margins increased 110 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the growth in base business of 80 basis points and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 30 basis points primarily due to the positive impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 90 basis points, partially offset by higher overhead costs, including investments in emerging markets related to the oil and gas businesses. Acquisitions diluted 

21

total operating margins by 70 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to lower operating margins and the impact of intangible asset amortization from acquisitions made within the past year.

Operating income increased 22.7% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the growth in base revenues and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower variable margins. Base margins increased 170 basis points primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the growth in base revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 40 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset amortization.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 2.0% in 2012 versus 2011 due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, which more than offset revenues from acquisitions and an increase in base revenues. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a European protective packaging business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a North American protective packaging business in the second quarter of 2011. Total North American base revenues increased 3.4% in 2012 versus 2011, while international base revenues declined 1.9% over the same period. Base revenues were virtually flat for the North American 

22

strapping and equipment businesses due to unfavorable selling prices and lower equipment sales, partially offset by increased sales volume in steel and plastic strapping. Base revenues for the international strapping and equipment businesses decreased 3.4%, primarily due to a slowdown in consumable sales in the European steel and lumber markets. Worldwide stretch packaging base revenues increased 4.9% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to increased equipment sales in North America and Europe and consumable sales to agricultural customers in Europe, while worldwide protective packaging grew 3.2% over the same period primarily due to increased product penetration.

Revenues increased 16.0% in 2011 versus 2010 due to the increase in base revenues, the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues for the North American strapping and equipment businesses increased 11.6% in 2011 versus 2010 largely due to higher steel and plastic strapping prices and increased equipment sales. Base revenues for the international strapping and equipment businesses grew 7.0% primarily due to higher strapping prices and higher equipment sales. Base revenues for stretch packaging worldwide increased 14.0% in 2011 versus 2010 and worldwide protective packaging grew 7.9% over the prior period. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a protective packaging business in the second quarter of 2011. 

Operating Income

Operating income increased 13.4% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base operating margins increased 180 basis points primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 170 basis points primarily due to the positive impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 70 basis points, the benefits of restructuring projects, primarily within the strapping business, and other overhead cost reductions.

Operating income increased 19.7% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, the favorable impact of currency translation and income from acquisitions, partially offset by lower variable margins and higher restructuring expenses. Base operating margins increased 40 basis points primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues of 250 basis points, partially offset by changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs decreased base margins by 210 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 110 basis points and higher operating expenses in North America.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 2.3% in 2012 versus 2011 due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, which more than offset the growth in base business. North American base revenues increased 3.0% in 2012 versus 2011 as equipment revenues increased 2.7% and service revenues increased 3.6%. The increase in equipment revenues was driven by growth in certain institutional, restaurant and retail markets, but declined in the fourth quarter of 2012, largely due to slower demand from institutional customers in budget constrained sectors. The increase in service revenues was partly due to expanded service capabilities and improved market penetration. International base revenues decreased 2.0% in 2012 versus 2011 as equipment revenues decreased 4.2%, driven by lower European sales in the cooking businesses, partially offset by product penetration gains in China and Brazil. International service revenues increased 3.4% driven by sales in Europe due to expanded service capabilities. 

Revenues increased 6.7% in 2011 versus 2010 due to the growth in base business, the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquisitions. North American food equipment base revenues increased 3.9% in 2011 versus 2010 as equipment revenues increased 4.6% and service revenues grew 2.7%. Equipment revenues increased primarily due to better, but still modest growth in the casual dining restaurant category, partially offset by weakness in institutional categories where government budgets were constrained. International base revenues increased 1.7% for the period as equipment revenues increased 1.0% and service revenues increased 3.3%. Growth in Asian and Latin American revenues was partially offset by lower European sales in 2011 versus 2010. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a European food equipment business in the third quarter of 2010.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 6.7% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to improved variable margins and productivity improvements, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base operating margins increased 140 basis points primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 120 basis points in 2012 versus 2011, primarily due to the positive impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 60 basis points and a 50 basis point improvement from lower operating expenses due to productivity improvements in North America and Europe.

Operating income increased 19.1% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to lower operating expenses, the increase in base revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses. Base business margins increased 220 basis points primarily due to lower operating expenses and adjustments related to a European business in 2010, and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues of 80 basis points noted above. Higher restructuring expenses in 2011 versus 2010 decreased total operating margins by 40 basis points.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012 and 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 2.9% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation and lower base revenues. International base revenues declined 3.4% in 2012 versus 2011 as European base revenues declined 5.1% due to lower sales of consumable products driven by a slowdown in construction activity in all European end markets. Base revenues in Asia Pacific declined 1.4% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to lower renovation and commercial construction activity in Australia and New Zealand. In North America, base revenue growth for residential, renovation and commercial construction was 9.5%, 5.6% and 4.1%, respectively. The North American base revenue increase was driven by improved U.S. housing starts as well as a modest increase in commercial construction square footage activity. 

Revenues increased 11.7% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation, revenues from acquisitions and an increase in base revenues. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a European retail distribution business in the second quarter of 2010 and a North American fastener business in the second quarter of 2011. European base revenues increased 7.2% due to improved conditions in commercial construction in the first half of the year; however, the rate of growth moderated in the second half of the year compared to early 2011. North American base revenues increased 2.3% primarily due to price increases implemented to offset higher steel prices, partially offset by the one-time licensing agreement settlement in the commercial construction business that positively impacted revenues in 2010. In 

25

North America, renovation base revenue growth was 5.5%, residential base revenue growth was 2.7% and commercial construction base revenue declined 3.0%. North American base revenue was impacted by 1% growth in remodeling expenditures, 3% annualized growth in U.S. housing starts as well as a 2% decline in commercial construction square footage activity. Base revenues for the Asia-Pacific region declined 1.7% as market conditions in the Australian residential construction market progressively softened throughout the year.

Operating Income

Operating income decreased 11.3% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to higher restructuring expenses, the unfavorable impact of currency translation and lower base revenues, partially offset by income from acquisitions. Total base margins decreased 20 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 due to the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues. The impact of changes in variable margins and overhead costs on total base margins was flat in 2012 versus 2011, as the favorable impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 20 basis points was offset by higher operating expenses in Europe. Restructuring expenses reduced total operating margins by 100 basis points due to increased cost reduction activities worldwide. 

Operating income increased 17.4% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect from the increase in base revenues described above, the favorable effect of currency translation, and lower restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 10 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to the favorable operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, partially offset by a one-time licensing agreement settlement in the commercial construction business that favorably affected margins in 2010, and the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 30 basis points.

POLYMERS & FLUIDS

Businesses in this segment produce adhesives, sealants, lubrication and cutting fluids, and hygiene products.

In the Polymers & Fluids segment, products include:

•adhesives for industrial, construction and consumer purposes;

•chemical fluids which clean or add lubrication to machines;

•epoxy and resin-based coating products for industrial applications; and

•hand wipes and cleaners for industrial applications.

In 2012, this segment primarily served the general industrial (33%), construction (14%) and maintenance, repair and operations, or "MRO", (18%) markets.

The results of operations for the Polymers & Fluids segment for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

26

In 2012 and 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues decreased 1.6% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the negative effect of currency translation and a decrease in base revenues, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Worldwide base revenues for the polymers and hygiene businesses decreased 4.0% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily driven by a decrease in European sales, especially in Spain, and from exiting low margin business. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids business decreased 1.4% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to decreased sales in Europe, partially offset by modest growth in North America and Brazil. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a manufacturer of advanced technology silicone materials in the second quarter of 2012 and a European specialty chemical business in the first quarter of 2012.

Revenues increased 24.9% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions, an increase in base revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a Latin American fluids business and a European polymers business in the fourth quarter of 2010. End market demand was stronger in North America and Asia Pacific but weaker in Europe. Total base revenues for the polymers businesses increased 2.7% while the fluids businesses increased 6.2% in 2011 versus 2010. North American base revenues increased 7.4% and European base revenues increased 3.2%, while Asia-Pacific base revenues increased 5.0% primarily due to growth in China.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 3.7% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to improvements in variable margins and income from acquisitions, partially offset by the decrease in base revenues noted above, the unfavorable effect of currency translation, and higher restructuring expenses. Total base margins increased 170 basis points versus last year primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 260 basis points, partially offset by the impact of the decrease in base revenues noted above. The positive impact from changes in variable margins and overhead costs was primarily due to the favorable impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 90 basis points, lower overhead costs of 110 basis points primarily due to the benefits of restructuring projects, and the loss on an international polymers contract that negatively impacted margins in 2011. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 80 basis points primarily due to the impact of intangible asset amortization from acquisitions made within the past year.

Operating income increased 12.6% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher operating costs and restructuring expenses. Base margins declined 20 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 90 basis points and a loss on an international polymers contract, partially offset by the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 90 basis points primarily due to the impact of intangible asset amortization.

27

ALL OTHER

This segment includes all other operating segments.

In the All Other segment, products include:

•equipment and related software for testing and measuring of materials, structures, gases and fluids;

•plastic reclosable packaging for consumer food storage;

•plastic consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles and related equipment;

•plastic and metal fasteners and components for appliances;

•foil, film and related equipment used to decorate consumer products;

•product coding and marking equipment and related consumables; and

•line integration, conveyor systems and line automation for the food and beverage industries.

In 2012, this segment primarily served the general industrial (27%), food and beverage (21%), consumer durables (12%), and food retail/service (4%) markets.

The results of operations for the All Other segment for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2012 and 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

Revenues increased 7.2% in 2012 versus 2011 due to revenues from acquisitions and an increase in base business, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the first quarter 2012 purchase of a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids. Base revenues increased 7.2% for the worldwide test and measurement businesses primarily due to increased equipment orders in North America, Europe, and China, and a one-time sale of equipment to a consumer electronics customer. Base revenues for the consumer packaging businesses were virtually flat as increased sales in both the global packaging solutions business and plastics and security business were offset by lower sales related to the reclosable packaging business and the worldwide foils and transfer ribbon business. Worldwide appliance base revenue growth was 8.0% primarily due to market penetration and improved customer demand in North America in 2012 versus 2011.

Revenues increased 11.8% in 2011 versus 2010 due to an increase in base business revenues, revenues from acquisitions and 

28

the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a test and measurement business in the fourth quarter of 2010, a heat transfer business in the second quarter of 2011, and a plastics and security business in the second quarter of 2010. Base business revenues for the test and measurement businesses increased 15.5% due to increased equipment orders both internationally and in North America. Growing worldwide product regulatory standards contributed to growth in these businesses. Base revenues for the consumer packaging business increased 4.7% in 2011 versus 2010 due to growth in the beverage packaging solutions, decorating equipment and marking and labels businesses. Base revenues for the worldwide appliance businesses declined 9.1% due to prolonged construction-associated weakness in the appliance end market.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 6.7% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the growth in base revenues and improved variable margins, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation, higher restructuring expenses, and the loss of income due to divestitures partially offset by income from acquisitions. Total base margins increased 160 basis points primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 90 basis points and the increase in base revenues noted above. The positive impact from changes in variable margins and overhead costs was primarily due to favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 40 basis points and other variable margin improvements of 40 basis points primarily due to product mix. Acquisitions (net of divestitures) diluted total operating margins by 130 basis points primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets from acquisitions made within the past year. Higher restructuring expenses decreased operating margins by 40 basis points due to increased cost reduction activities in 2012.

Operating income increased 23.8% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the growth in base revenues. Base margins increased 210 basis points primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect from the increase in base revenues of 190 basis points and changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 20 basis points. The positive impact from changes in variable margins and overhead costs was primarily due to the benefits from past restructuring projects. Acquisitions (net of divestitures) diluted total operating margins by 30 basis points in 2011.

DECORATIVE SURFACES

The Decorative Surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.

On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by CD&R. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed joint venture, Wilsonart. The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Effective November 1, 2012, the Company made changes to its management reporting structure and Decorative Surfaces is no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

Historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues declined 15.0% and operating income decreased 7.5% in 2012 versus 2011 due to there being only ten months of operating results in 2012 versus twelve months of operating results in 2011 as the Company divested a 51% interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment on October 31, 2012. 

Revenues increased 9.3% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation. Operating income increased 12.8% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher operating costs.

29

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Amortization of intangible assets increased to $288 million in 2012 from $255 million in 2011, due to newly acquired businesses, most notably a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids in the All Other segment acquired in the beginning of 2012. Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2011 versus $207 million in 2010, due to intangible asset amortization for newly acquired businesses, most notably a North American automotive aftermarket business in the Transportation segment and a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer in the Power Systems & Electronics segment.

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In 2012, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1 million related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment and an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $1 million related to an international reporting unit in the Food Equipment segment. There were no impairment charges in 2011. In 2010, there was an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $1 million related to the test and measurement reporting unit in the All Other segment. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense increased to $214 million in 2012, which includes the full year impact of interest expense on the 3.375% notes and 4.875% notes issued in late August 2011 and the interest expense related to the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $192 million in 2011. The increase was partially offset by lower interest expense on the 6.55% preferred debt securities which were fully paid on the first business day in 2012. Interest expense increased to $192 million in 2011 versus $175 million in 2010 primarily due to interest expense on the 3.375% notes and 4.875% notes issued in late August 2011. The weighted-average interest rate on the Company's commercial paper was 0.2% in 2012, 0.1% in 2011 and 0.2% in 2010.

GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $933 million ($632 million after-tax) related to the sale of a 51% majority interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other income (expense) was income of $37 million in 2012 versus $54 million in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to an equity loss related to Wilsonart of $30 million in 2012, lower income from investments of $11 million (versus $17 million in 2011), and losses on foreign currency transactions of $11 million (versus $4 million in 2011), partially offset by gains on the disposal of operations and affiliates of $22 million (versus $2 million in 2011). See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the Wilsonart transaction.

Other income (expense) was income of $54 million in 2011 versus $10 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher interest income of $40 million (versus $24 million in 2010), lower losses on foreign currency transactions of $4 million (versus $17 million in 2010) and gains on disposal of operations and affiliates of $2 million (versus losses of $8 million in 2010).

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate was 30.7% in 2012, 22.2% in 2011, and 30.5% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2012 was unfavorably impacted by discrete tax charges totaling $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included $35 million for the settlement of an IRS tax audit for the years 2008-2009. The effective tax rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by the discrete non-cash tax benefit of $166 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the decision in the Company’s favor by the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions that had been challenged by the Australian Tax Office. The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by the discrete tax charge of $22 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. 

See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details on these discrete tax adjustments and a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.

30

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Income from continuing operations in 2012 of $2.5 billion ($5.27 per diluted share) was 23.7% higher than 2011 income of $2.0 billion ($4.08 per diluted share). Income from continuing operations in 2011 was 38.9% higher than 2010 income of $1.5 billion ($2.89 per diluted share).

FOREIGN CURRENCY

The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2012 versus 2011 decreased operating revenues by approximately $466 million in 2012 and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $44 million ($0.09 per diluted share). The weakening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2011 versus 2010 increased operating revenues by approximately $460 million in 2011 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately $51 million ($0.10 per diluted share).

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Income from discontinued operations was $375 million in 2012 versus $54 million in 2011 primarily due to an after-tax gain of $372 million on the sale of the finishing business in the second quarter of 2012. Income from discontinued operations in 2011 was higher than 2010 income of $51 million primarily due to improved operating results in the held for sale finishing business partially offset by an after-tax loss of $3 million on the sale of a discontinued operation in 2011 versus an after-tax gain of $5 million on the sale of a discontinued operation in 2010. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.

2013 SEGMENT CHANGES

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprise-wide portfolio management initiative.

 As a result of this reorganization, the Company's operations will be prospectively aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Industrial Packaging; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Automotive OEM; Polymers & Fluids; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Welding; and Specialty Products.

The significant changes resulting from this reorganization include the following: 

•Certain businesses within the former Transportation segment, primarily related to the automotive aftermarket business, will be reported in the Polymers & Fluids segment and the Transportation segment will be renamed Automotive OEM.

•The Welding business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, will be reported separately as the Welding segment.

•The Electronics business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, will be combined with the Test & Measurement business, which was formerly reported in the All Other segment, to form a new Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.

•The All Other segment will be renamed Specialty Products.

The 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K has not been restated for these changes in segment reporting. Results for 2012 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which the Company managed its business in 2012 and do not reflect the January 2013 reorganization described above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to finance internal growth, to continue to pay dividends, and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.

The primary uses of liquidity are:

•dividend payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years’ free operating cash flow;

•acquisitions; and

•share repurchases.

31

Cash Flow

The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On August 20, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2007 Program”). Under the 2007 Program, the Company made repurchases of approximately 16.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $53.51 per share and approximately 8.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.29 per share during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 Program.

On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). Under the 2011 Program, the Company made repurchases of approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.20 per share during 2011 and approximately 35.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $56.93 per share during 2012. As of December 31, 2012, there was approximately $1.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.

Return on Average Invested Capital

The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.

32

ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

ROIC decreased 180 basis points in 2012 versus 2011 as a result of after-tax operating income decreasing 7.2% and an increase in average invested capital. The decrease in after-tax operating income was due to a higher tax rate in 2012 resulting from discrete tax charges in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included the settlement of an IRS tax audit for the years 2008-2009, versus a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2011 for an Australian tax matter. The fourth quarter 2012 discrete tax charges had an unfavorable 40 basis point impact on ROIC in 2012.

ROIC increased 220 basis points in 2011 versus 2010 as a result of after-tax operating income increasing 35.6%, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital. The increase in after-tax operating income was due to an increase in base business and a lower tax rate in 2011 resulting from a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2011 for an Australian tax matter versus a discrete tax charge in the first quarter of 2010 for the impact of the health care reform legislation. The first quarter 2011 discrete tax benefit had a favorable 140 basis point impact on ROIC in 2011. 

Working Capital

Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

33

Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2011, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.

Debt

Total debt and total debt to capitalization at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2016 and $1.5 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017. No amounts were outstanding under these two facilities at December 31, 2012. The Company’s foreign operations also had authorized credit facilities of $337 million of which $89 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2012. 

The Company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately $408 million and $192 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, which is included in short-term debt. The maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2012 was $1.5 billion while the average daily balance was $808 million.

In 2012, the Company issued $1.1 billion of 3.9% notes due September 1, 2042 at 99.038% of face value. The effective interest rate of the notes is 3.955%. These notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay outstanding commercial paper.

The Company believes that, based on its current free operating cash flow, debt to capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. 

Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA

The Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, gain on sale of interest in Decorative Surfaces, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.

34

Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company's debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased from 1.2 to 1.5 in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to the increase in long-term debt related to the $1.1 billion of 3.9% notes that were issued in August 2012.

Stockholders’ Equity

The changes to stockholders’ equity during 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company’s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2012, the Company has recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $108 million. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. 

At December 31, 2012, the Company had open stand-by letters of credit of approximately $194 million, substantially all of which expire in 2013 and 2014. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2012.

35

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. Various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The Company's critical accounting policies are as follows:

Realizability of Inventories — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition, for approximately 44% of the U.S. inventories, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method due to the effects of inflation.

Collectibility of Accounts Receivable — The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.

Depreciation of Plant and Equipment — The Company’s U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:

Buildings and improvements150% declining balance

Machinery and equipment200% declining balance

The majority of the Company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations.

Income Taxes — The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets — The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its 40 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of $7.8 billion allocated to its 40 reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the 

36

number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 40 reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Company’s 80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $9 million to $1.1 billion, with the average amount equal to $195 million.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Company’s global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits — The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. Pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.

The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $36 million.

The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2012 and will be 8.0% for 2013. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.
