ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  

Business Overview  

Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that touch the lives of people where they work, live and play. With annual sales of over $6 billion, the Companys products are marketed under a strong portfolio of brands, including Sharpie®, Paper Mate®, Dymo®, Expo®, Waterman®, Parker®, Rolodex®, Irwin®, Lenox®, BernzOmatic®, Rubbermaid®, TC®, Levolor®, Graco®, Aprica®, Calphalon® and Goody®. The Companys multi-product offering consists of well-known name-brand consumer and commercial products in four business segments during 2008: Cleaning, Organization & Décor; Office Products; Tools & Hardware; and Home & Family.  

Business Strategy  

Newell Rubbermaids vision is to become a global company of Brands That Matter and great people, known for best-in-class results. The Company is committed to building consumer-meaningful brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer performance and value. To support its multi-year transformation into a best-in-class global consumer branding and marketing organization, the Company has adopted a strategy that focuses on optimizing the business portfolio, building consumer-meaningful brands on a global scale, and achieving best cost and efficiency in its operations.  

       Optimizing the business portfolio includes reducing the Companys exposure to non-strategic businesses and product lines and acquiring businesses that facilitate geographic and category expansion, thus enhancing the potential for growth and improved profitability of the overall portfolio.  

       Building consumer-meaningful brands involves embracing a consumer-driven innovation process, developing best-in-class marketing and branding capabilities across the organization and investing in strategic brand building activities, including investments in research and development to better understand target consumers and their needs.  

       Achieving best cost involves the Companys adoption of best-in-class practices, such as leveraging scale, restructuring the supply chain to improve capacity utilization and to deliver productivity savings, reducing costs in non-market facing activities, designing products to optimize input costs, and utilizing strategic sourcing partners when it is cost effective. Achieving best cost allows the Company to improve its competitive position, generate funds for increased investment in strategic brand building initiatives, and preserve cash and liquidity in the midst of volatile commodity and currency markets and the current global economic slowdown.  

Market Overview  

The Company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets, which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates. During 2008, the Companys results were impacted by the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions, significant inflation, a volatile currency environment, instability in the credit markets, and disruption of global equity markets. These factors, combined with rising unemployment levels and the contraction of consumer credit markets, adversely impacted consumer confidence leading to reductions in consumer spending. The Companys results were impacted as follows:  

       The inflationary commodity environment and volatile currency environment led to significant year-over-year inflation in raw materials, including resin, and sourced finished goods. The primary drivers for the increases were record-high energy prices, including the price of oil and natural gas, and currency volatility on sourced products. The record-high energy prices contributed to increases in transportation costs and the cost of resin, since oil and natural gas are key inputs in the production and cost of certain types of resin. For 2008, inflation adversely impacted year-over-year gross margins by approximately $200.0 million.

Table of Contents 

       As consumer confidence waned, the Company experienced pressure on its sales, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008, across all businesses and geographies since consumer spending declined and retailers responded by tightly managing inventory levels.  

       Declines in residential and commercial construction markets contributed to sales declines in the Tools & Hardware segment and the Décor business. An estimated 0.9 million housing units were started in 2008 compared to 1.4 million housing units started in 2007, and existing home sales declined from 5.7 million units in 2007 to 4.9 million units in 2008.  

In response to these market conditions, the Company took the following actions:  

       Expanded Project Acceleration, the Companys restructuring initiative, to include the divestiture, rationalization, or exit of selected low margin, commodity-like, and resin-intensive product categories, to create a more focused and more profitable platform for growth by reducing the Companys exposure to volatile commodity markets and raw material inflation.  

       Implemented pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures experienced across multiple product lines in 2008, particularly those where resin is the primary cost of products, including quarterly price adjustment mechanisms to adjust prices to reflect actual changes in raw material, processing and transportation costs. These price increases offset a portion of the input cost inflation experienced in 2008.  

       Managed working capital to maximize cash flow, with a particular focus on lowering receivables days sales outstanding and inventory levels, including accelerating SKU rationalization efforts.  

       Continued to optimize the cost structure of the business by reducing and streamlining structural costs, which included initiating salaried work force reductions, freezing wages and salaries, reducing the number of global business units from 16 to 13, and consolidating the segment structure from four to three segments for 2009. This allowed the Company to continue to invest in brand building and product development, gaining valuable consumer insight, delivering innovative new products, expanding the Companys leading brands into near neighbor product categories and new geographic regions, and acquiring businesses with consumer-meaningful brands with differentiated products in global categories, including Aprica and Technical Concepts.  

       Reduced the dividend payable on its common stock from $0.84 per year to $0.42 per year to align the dividend yield and payout ratio more closely with the Companys industry peers. The new dividend policy better positions the Company to protect its investment grade credit rating and maintain continuing access to credit markets by allowing the Company to retain approximately $120.0 million of cash flows annually.  

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $761.0 million of debt obligations payable within one year, substantially all of which matures in September 2009 and December 2009. The Company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements; however, access to the capital markets or successful negotiation of other arrangements cannot be assured.  

Ongoing Initiatives  

Through the Project Acceleration restructuring program and other initiatives, the Company has made significant progress in improving capacity utilization rates to deliver productivity savings and increasing the use of strategic sourcing partners. In order to achieve logistical excellence and optimize its geographic footprint, the Company continues to evaluate its supply chain to identify opportunities to realize efficiencies in purchasing, distribution and transportation. The Company expects to incur between $100 and $150 million ($80 and $120 million after-tax) of Project Acceleration restructuring costs in 2009.  

The Company strives to leverage the common business activities and best practices of its business units, and to build one common culture of shared values with a focus on collaboration and teamwork. Through this initiative, the Company has established regional shared services centers to leverage non-market facing functional capabilities to reduce costs. The Company has also begun migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP global information platform in a phased, multi-year rollout. SAP is expected to enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently. To date, the North American operations of its Home & Family and Office Products segments have successfully gone live with their SAP implementation efforts.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are important in evaluating the Companys operations. The following table sets forth items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Results of Operations  2008 vs. 2007  

Net sales for 2008 were $6,470.6 million, representing an increase of $63.3 million, or 1%, from $6,407.3 million for 2007. The Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions increased sales by $204.7 million, or 3.2%, over the prior year, and foreign currency contributed 0.8% of sales growth. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions, mid single-digit sales growth in the Home & Family segment was more than offset by a high single-digit decline in the Tools & Hardware segment and low single-digit declines in the Cleaning, Organization & Décor and Office Products segments.  

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2008 was 32.8%, or $2,123.2 million, versus 35.2%, or $2,257.2 million, for 2007. Positive pricing and savings from Project Acceleration of approximately $40.0 million were more than offset by the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation as well as lower manufacturing volumes and unfavorable product mix experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008.  

SG&A expenses for 2008 were 23.2% of net sales, or $1,502.7 million, versus 22.3% of net sales, or $1,430.9 million, for 2007. The $71.8 million increase was primarily driven by SG&A expenses associated with the Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency, which more than offset the impacts of the Companys management of structural and strategic SG&A spending.  

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $120.3 million and $86.0 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in restructuring costs for 2008 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to $36.0 million of asset impairment charges recorded in 2008 associated with the Companys plan to divest, downsize or exit certain product categories where resin is the primary component of cost of products sold. The 2008 restructuring costs included $46.1 million of facility and other exit costs, including the $36.0 million of asset impairment charges noted above, $57.5 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $16.7 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs, of which $3.1 million relates to the Companys 2001 Restructuring Plan. The 2007 restructuring costs included $27.7 million of facility and other exit costs, $36.4 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $21.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Project Acceleration is designed to reduce manufacturing overhead, better align the Companys distribution and transportation processes, and reorganize the overall business structure to align with the Companys core organizing concept, the global business unit, to achieve best total cost. Project Acceleration is expected to be fully implemented in 2010 and is expected to result in cumulative restructuring costs over the life of the initiative totaling between $475 and $500 million ($405 and $425 million after-tax), including $250 to $270 million of employee-related costs, $155 to $175 million in non-cash asset-related costs, and $50 to $70 million in other associated restructuring costs. Approximately 67% of the Project Acceleration restructuring costs are expected to be cash charges.  

The adverse impact of the macroeconomic environment on the Company during the fourth quarter of 2008, particularly the decrease in consumer demand, combined with the updated outlook for certain business units led the Company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2008. As a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $299.4   

23  

Table of Contents 

 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain business units in the Tools & Hardware and Office Products segments. No similar impairment charges were recorded in 2007 or 2006. The Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.  

Operating income for 2008 was $200.8 million, or 3.1% of net sales, versus $740.3 million, or 11.6% of net sales, in 2007. The $539.5 million decline in operating income is primarily attributable to the $299.4 million of impairment charges noted above, the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation on gross margin and the $36.0 million of Project Acceleration asset impairment charges in 2008 discussed above, partially offset by gross margin improvements from productivity initiatives and favorable pricing during 2008.  

Interest expense, net, for 2008 was $137.9 million versus $104.1 million for 2007. The $33.8 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by additional borrowings in 2008 used to fund the acquisitions of Aprica and Technical Concepts.  

Other expense, net, for 2008 was $61.1 million versus $7.3 million for 2007. The increase in other expense, net, in 2008 is primarily attributable to the $52.2 million loss on debt extinguishment relating to the Companys redemption of its $250.0 million of Reset notes in July 2008.  

The Company recognized income tax expense of $53.6 million for 2008, compared to $149.7 million for 2007. The decrease in tax expense was primarily a result of a decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007. The impact of the decrease in operating income from 2007 to 2008 on income tax expense was partially offset by a decrease in the tax rates applied to the various discrete expenses, including restructuring and impairment charges, in 2008 compared to 2007, which had the effect of increasing income tax expense in 2008 compared to 2007. Income tax expense for 2008 and 2007 was favorably impacted by the recognition of net income tax benefits of $29.9 million and $41.3 million, respectively, primarily related to favorable outcomes from the IRSs review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired. See Footnote 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

For 2007, the Company recognized a loss from operations of discontinued operations of $0.2 million, net of tax, related to the results of the remaining operations of the Home Décor Europe business and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $11.9 million, net of tax, related primarily to the disposal of the remaining operations of the Home Décor Europe business.  

Results of Operations  2007 vs. 2006  

Net sales for 2007 were $6,407.3 million, representing an increase of $206.3 million, or 3.3%, from $6,201.0 million for 2006. Foreign currency contributed approximately 2.0% of sales growth. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, sales increased 1.3%. The increase was primarily related to mid single digit sales growth in the Home & Family and Cleaning, Organization & Décor segments, partially offset by a decrease in Office Products sales.  

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2007 was 35.2%, or $2,257.2 million, versus 33.4%, or $2,070.0 million, for 2006. Ongoing productivity initiatives, favorable mix, and savings from Project Acceleration, which contributed approximately $45 million to gross margin, drove the 185 basis point improvement year over year, with pricing offsetting raw material inflation.  

SG&A expenses for 2007 were 22.3% of net sales, or $1,430.9 million, versus 21.7% of net sales, or $1,347.0 million, for 2006. Approximately 38% of the increase is attributable to foreign currency, with the remainder due to investments in brand building, product development and other corporate initiatives, including SAP and Shared Services. These investments were partially offset by $15 million in savings from Project Acceleration and other structural overhead reductions.  

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $86.0 million and $66.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2007 restructuring costs included $27.7 million of facility and other exit costs, $36.4 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $21.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2006 restructuring costs included $14.9 million of facility and other exit costs, $44.7 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $6.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Operating income for 2007 was $740.3 million, or 11.6% of net sales, versus $656.6 million, or 10.6% of net sales, in 2006. This increase was driven by sales and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the increased investment in brand building and product development initiatives, expansion of Shared Services and implementation of SAP.

Table of Contents 

Net nonoperating expenses for 2007 were 1.7% of net sales, or $111.4 million, versus 2.3% of net sales, or $141.7 million, for 2006. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses was mainly attributable to a decrease in interest expense, reflecting a reduction in average debt outstanding year over year and slightly lower average borrowing rates.  

The Company recognized income tax expense of $149.7 million for 2007, compared to $44.2 million for 2006. The increase in tax expense was primarily a result of an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by a decrease in income tax benefits recorded in 2007 compared to 2006. Income tax expense for 2007 and 2006 were favorably impacted by the recognition of net income tax benefits of $41.3 million and $102.8 million, respectively, primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain tax positions, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain deductions, and the reorganization of certain legal entities in Europe.  

The loss from discontinued operations for 2007 was $12.1 million, compared to $85.7 million for 2006. The loss on the disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 was $11.9 million, net of tax, compared to a gain of $0.7 million, net of tax, for 2006. The 2007 loss related primarily to the disposal of the remaining operations of the Home Décor Europe business. The 2006 gain related primarily to the disposal of the Little Tikes business, partially offset by the loss recognized on the disposal of portions of the Home Décor Europe business. The loss from operations of discontinued operations for 2007 was $0.2 million, net of tax, compared to $86.4 million, net of tax, for 2006. The 2006 amount primarily relates to the Little Tikes and Home Décor Europe businesses and includes a $50.9 million impairment charge to write off goodwill of the Home Décor Europe business. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cleaning, Organization & Décor  

Net sales for 2008 were $2,147.3 million, an increase of $50.9 million, or 2.4%, from $2,096.4 million in 2007. The Technical Concepts acquisition increased sales $109.2 million, or 5.2%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales decreased $58.3 million, or 2.8%, as high single-digit growth in the Rubbermaid Food business and mid single-digit growth in the Rubbermaid Commercial business were more than offset by softness in the Rubbermaid Home and Décor businesses.  

Operating income for 2008 was $238.6 million, or 11.1% of sales, a decrease of $34.7 million from $273.3 million, or 13.0% of sales, in 2007. Significant raw material inflation, particularly in resin, and lower manufacturing volume more than offset the contribution from favorable pricing and the Technical Concepts acquisition during 2008.

Table of Contents 

Office Products  

Net sales for 2008 were $2,005.8 million, a decrease of $36.5 million, or 1.8%, from $2,042.3 million in 2007. Favorable foreign currency and growth in the segments international businesses in local currency was more than offset by a decline in domestic sales driven by adverse economic conditions in the U.S., including lower consumer demand and inventory management at U.S. retailers. The European business benefited in comparison to prior year from softer sales in 2007 driven mainly by service level interruptions that did not repeat in 2008.  

Operating income for 2008 was $215.8 million, or 10.8% of sales, a decrease of $102.1 million from $317.9 million, or 15.6% of sales, in 2007, as positive pricing and favorable foreign currency were more than offset by raw material inflation, unfavorable mix and core sales declines in North America. Additionally, in response to significant sales declines during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company reduced production at certain manufacturing facilities and accelerated SKU rationalization efforts. These efforts contributed to the decline in operating income year-over-year.  

Tools & Hardware  

Net sales for 2008 were $1,200.3 million, a decrease of $88.4 million, or 6.9%, from $1,288.7 million in 2007. Contributions from favorable foreign currency and positive pricing were more than offset by declines in core sales in the segments domestic businesses, attributable to continued declines in the U.S. residential construction market, retail inventory management and increased softness in industrial and commercial channels.  

Operating income for 2008 was $145.3 million, or 12.1% of sales, a decrease of $36.2 million from $181.5 million, or 14.1% of sales, in 2007, as contributions from SG&A expenses reduction initiatives, favorable pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by raw material inflation, unfavorable mix and core sales declines in North America.  

Home & Family  

Net sales for 2008 were $1,117.2 million, an increase of $137.3 million, or 14.0%, from $979.9 million in 2007. The Aprica acquisition increased sales $95.5 million, or 9.7%. The remaining increase of $41.8 million, or 4.3%, was primarily attributable to high single-digit growth in the Baby & Parenting Essentials business attributable to product launches and favorable pricing during 2008.  

Operating income for 2008 was $102.7 million, or 9.2% of sales, a decrease of $32.9 million from $135.6 million, or 13.8% of sales, in 2007, as contributions from core sales increases and positive pricing were more than offset by unfavorable mix, sourced product inflation and an increase in strategic SG&A spending for new product launches and brand building investments, mainly related to Aprica. Additionally, child safety protection laws enacted during the latter half of 2008 contributed to the year-over-year decline in operating income for the Baby & Parenting Essentials business unit.

Cleaning, Organization & Décor  

Net sales for 2007 were $2,096.4 million, an increase of $100.7 million, or 5.0%, from $1,995.7 million in 2006, driven by double-digit sales growth in Rubbermaid Commercial, resulting from new product launches during the year, mid single-digit growth in Rubbermaid Home due to growth in sales of home organization and insulated products, and low single-digit growth in the Rubbermaid Food and Décor businesses.  

Operating income for 2007 was $273.3 million, or 13.0% of sales, an increase of $64.2 million from $209.1 million, or 10.5% of sales, in 2006. The improvement in operating income was the result of sales growth driven by strategic SG&A investments and gross margin expansion, resulting from productivity gains and favorable mix.  

Office Products  

Net sales for 2007 were $2,042.3 million, an increase of $10.7 million, or 0.5% from $2,031.6 million in 2006. Growth in the Office Technology business, driven by increased sales in the Dymo business and the acquisition of Endicia, along with favorable foreign currency, was offset by overall softness in the U.S. resulting from weaker foot traffic in the North American office retailers and inventory corrections taken within that same channel.  

Operating income for 2007 was $317.9 million, or 15.6% of sales, an increase of $30.9 million from $287.0 million, or 14.1% of sales, in 2006. This increase primarily resulted from gross margin expansion, resulting from favorable mix and pricing initiatives, partially offset by increased investment in brand building activities.  

Tools & Hardware  

Net sales for 2007 were $1,288.7 million, an increase of $26.5 million, or 2.1%, from $1,262.2 million in 2006. The successful commercialization of certain products, particularly industrial bandsaw blades, and favorable foreign currency drove sales growth in Europe and Latin America, which more than offset continued softness in the domestic tool and hardware businesses affected primarily by the U.S. residential construction market. The Construction Tools & Accessories and Industrial Products & Services businesses combined yielded mid single-digit growth for the year.  

Operating income for 2007 was $181.5 million, or 14.1% of sales, a decrease of $3.5 million from $185.0 million, or 14.7% of sales, in 2006. Top line growth and productivity initiatives were more than offset by investments in strategic brand building.  

Home & Family  

Net sales for 2007 were $979.9 million, an increase of $68.4 million, or 7.5%, from $911.5 million in 2006. Broad based success in all three business units was fueled by new product launches and better sell-through resulting from demand creation activities.  

Operating income for 2007 was $135.6 million, or 13.8% of sales, an increase of $17.7 million from $117.9 million, or 12.9% of sales, in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by top line sales growth supported by increased SG&A investments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Cash Flows  

Cash and cash equivalents (decreased) increased as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the effects of acquisitions, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement differ with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet.  

Sources  

Historically, the Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have included cash provided by operations, proceeds from divestitures, issuance of debt, and use of available borrowing facilities.  

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $454.9 million compared to $655.3 million for the prior year. The decrease is attributable primarily to lower income from continuing operations, a reduction in accounts payable, and the timing of payments of accrued liabilities, including income taxes, partially offset by working capital reductions driven by improved collection on accounts receivables and tighter management of inventory levels. Cash provided by operating activities for 2007 reflect an increase of $11.9 million from $643.4 million in 2006, primarily attributable to increased net income, offset by increased investments in working capital, including cash restructuring costs.  

In 2008, the Company received proceeds of $1,318.0 million from the issuance of debt compared to $420.8 million in 2007. In September 2008, the Company entered into a $400.0 million credit agreement, under which the Company received an unsecured three-year term loan in the amount of $400.0 million (the Term Loan). Net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In March 2008, the Company completed the offering and sale of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500.0 million in 5.50% senior unsecured notes due April 2013 and $250.0 million in 6.25% senior unsecured notes due April 2018. Net proceeds from this offering were used to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2007 include the issuance of commercial paper to fund acquisitions and the repayment of a five-year, $250.0 million medium term note that matured in 2007. Proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2006 were $177.0 million.  

Uses  

Historically, the Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources have included acquisitions, dividend payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt.  

The Company made payments on notes payable, commercial paper and long-term debt of $772.5 million, $478.3 million and $511.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In July 2008, the Company redeemed its $250.0 million of Reset notes due July 2028 for $302.2 million, which includes the Companys purchase of the remarketing option embedded in the Reset notes from a third party for $52.2 million. In July 2008, the Company also repaid $65.0 million of its $75.0 million outstanding 6.11% medium term notes due July 2028 in accordance with the terms of the notes. The Company utilized its commercial paper program to fund the redemption of the Reset notes, the purchase of the remarketing option, and the repayment of the $65.0 million of 6.11% medium term notes due July 2028. The remaining payments made on debt during 2008 mainly represent the pay off of commercial paper. In 2007, the Company retired a five-year, $250 million, 6% fixed rate note, at maturity, and made payments on commercial paper. In 2006, the Company used available cash to pay off commercial paper and retire a $150.0 million, 6.6% fixed rate medium-term note that matured. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.  

Cash used for acquisitions was $655.7 million, $106.0 million, and $60.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The cash used in 2008 relates primarily to the acquisitions of Technical Concepts and Aprica, while cash used in 2007 included the acquisition of

 Endicia. The Company did not invest in significant acquisitions in 2006. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Aggregate dividends paid were $234.5 million, $234.7 million and $232.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

Capital expenditures were $157.8 million, $157.3 million and $138.3 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The largest single capital project in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006 was the implementation of SAP.  

Cash used for restructuring activities was $60.9 million, $53.1 million, and $26.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in the cash flows from operating activities. These payments relate primarily to employee termination benefits.  

Financial Position  

The Company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity, managing working capital, and monitoring the Companys overall capitalization.  

       Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 were $275.4 million, and the Company had $690.0 million available for borrowing under its syndicated revolving credit facility (the Revolver).  

       Working capital at December 31, 2008 was $187.9 million compared to $87.9 million at December 31, 2007, and the current ratio at December 31, 2008 was 1.09:1 compared to 1.03:1 at December 31, 2007. The increase in working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to the repayment of current maturities of long-term debt and commercial paper during 2008 with proceeds from the Term Loan.  

       The Company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating total debt to total capitalization. Total debt to total capital capitalization is defined as the sum of short- and long-term debt, less cash, divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders equity, less cash. Total debt to total capitalization was .62:1 at December 31, 2008 and .45:1 at December 31, 2007. The Companys debt to total capitalization in 2008 was adversely impacted by the performance of the Companys pension plan assets in 2008, fluctuations in foreign currency, borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Aprica and Technical Concepts, and the net loss recorded in 2008 which was primarily attributable to the impairment charges totaling $299.4 million.  

Over the long-term, the Company plans to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results, managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay certain debt maturities. In addition, the Company reduced the dividend payable on its common stock by 50%.  

Borrowing Arrangements  

The Companys Revolver expires in November 2012. As of December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver, and the Company had $690.0 million available for borrowing. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $690.0 million of commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. However, the Companys current short-term debt credit ratings, coupled with turmoil in the credit markets, may preclude it from accessing the commercial paper market. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. There was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008, and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver.  

The Company has several covenants under its Revolver and Term Loan facilities, two of which are interest coverage and debt to total capitalization. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had complied with all covenants under the facilities and had sufficiently exceeded the requirements for both the interest coverage and debt to total capitalization covenants. A failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the Companys ability to borrow under the Revolver and Term Loan.  

Debt  

The Companys objective is to finance the business through the appropriate mix of short-term and long-term debt. The Company has varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business. The volume and timing of production impacts the Companys cash flows and involves increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased   

29  

Table of Contents 

 customer demand through the remainder of the year. Working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through the commercial paper markets in the U.S., which is supported by the Revolver. However, access to the commercial paper market cannot be assured with the Companys current short-term debt credit ratings and, therefore, the Company may be required to access the Revolver for future working capital needs.  

Total debt increased $694.4 million to $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2008 from $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 resulted from the issuance of $750.0 million of senior unsecured notes in March 2008 and $400.0 million borrowed pursuant to the Term Loan, offset by the repayment of $315.0 million of medium term notes and $197.0 million of commercial paper. The December 31, 2008 debt balance was also affected by the mark-to-market adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixed rate debt, pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The mark-to-market adjustments increased the carrying value of debt by $62.3 million in 2008 compared to 2007.  

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $761.0 million of short-term debt, including a floating rate note of $448.0 million related to its 2001 receivables facility that matures in September 2009, a $50.0 million principal payment on the Term Loan due in September 2009, and $250.0 million of medium term notes that mature in December 2009. The Company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements; however, access to the capital markets cannot be assured, particularly in light of the recent turmoil and uncertainty in the global credit markets, the February 2009 downgrade by Moodys and Standard & Poors of the Companys credit ratings to the lowest rating considered investment grade, and alternative financing arrangements may result in higher borrowing costs for the Company.  

Pension Obligations  

The Company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the U.S. and in various other countries. The Companys ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plans assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets. In 2008, total contributions to all of the Companys pension plans totaled approximately $32.6 million. During 2008, the Companys primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan moved from a near fully funded status to an approximate $260.0 million underfunded status, driven by a decrease in the value of plan assets. Because of this situation, the Company currently expects to make contributions to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan of approximately $50 to $75 million in 2009, which is in addition to the $25.0 million of contributions expected to be made to the Companys other pension plans in 2009.  

Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. The Company determines its plan asset investment mix, in part, on the duration of each plans liabilities. Across all plans, at December 31, 2008, approximately 41% of assets are invested in equities, 23% in fixed income investments, 17% in cash and 19% in other investments. To the extent each plans assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the Company, the Company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate.  

Dividends  

In January 2009, the Company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from $0.21 per share to $0.105 per share. The Company currently expects to maintain this dividend rate throughout 2009; however, the payment of dividends to holders of the Companys common stock remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Companys financial condition, earnings, legal requirements and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.  

Credit Ratings  

The Companys credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service downgraded the Companys long-term debt rating from Baa2 to Baa3 and its short-term debt rating from P-2 to P-3, and Standard & Poors downgraded the Companys long-term rating from BBB+ to BBB- and its short-term debt rating from A-2 to A-3. Both Moodys and Standard & Poors reaffirmed their Negative outlook. The Companys current senior debt credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings are Baa3, BBB- and BBB, respectively. Its current short-term debt credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings are P-3, A-3 and F-2, respectively. Changes in the Companys operating results, cash flows, or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of the Companys credit ratings.

Outlook  

In 2009, the Company expects to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to contribute $75 to $100 million to its foreign and U.S. pension plans, use $100 million of cash for restructuring activities related to Project Acceleration, and fund capital expenditures of approximately $150 million, which include expenditures associated with the implementation of SAP.  

Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under the Revolver, will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses, assuming the Company refinances its maturing short-term debt in 2009.  

Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies  

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded $29.9 million, $41.3 million and $102.8 million, respectively, in net income tax benefits as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the IRS, the settlement of certain tax contingency reserves, the reversal of a valuation allowance, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in Europe. These benefits are reflected in the Companys 2008, 2007 and 2006 Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals, which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows.  

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2008 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.  

The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2008. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2008. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (2)  Amounts represent estimated interest expense on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2008 based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due. Interest on floating debt was estimated using the index rate in effect as of December 31, 2008. For further information, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (3)  Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2008. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (4)  Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligations are due as provided in the lease agreements as of December 31, 2008. Capital lease obligation balances are classified as Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008.

Table of Contents 

 (5)  Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2008 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services and joint venture interests pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms. The Company purchased the minority interest of a majority owned subsidiary in the first quarter of 2009 for approximately $30.0 million which is included in the purchase obligations amount shown in the table above.  

 (6)  Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2008 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for Current portion of long-term debt.  

The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. As a large taxpayer, the Company is under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the $164.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at December 31, 2008 is excluded from the preceding table. See Footnote 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  

Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table. The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of $607.7 million. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $82.2 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self-insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability and medical. See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

As of December 31, 2008, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies.  

Sales Recognition  

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts.  

Recovery of Accounts Receivable   

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Accounts are reviewed for potential write-off on a case by case basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

Table of Contents 

Inventory Reserves  

The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company conducted its annual test of impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names). The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level (herein referred to as the reporting unit). The Company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process. The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount. The impact of the macroeconomic environment on the Company during the fourth quarter of 2008 combined with the updated outlook for certain business units during the period led the Company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2008. As a result, during 2008, the Company completed its annual impairment test during the third quarter of 2008 and completed an impairment test as of December 31, 2008 based on events and circumstances that arose during the fourth quarter of 2008. 

In its goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than the fair value, impairment may be present. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units generally based on discounted cash flow models, market multiples of earnings, or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer, if available. The Company assesses the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were the Company to license the use of the trademark or trade name. The Companys use of a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets involves several assumptions, and changes in assumptions could materially impact fair value estimates. Assumptions critical to the Companys fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow models include discount rates, royalty rates, and cash flow projections, and inherent in cash flow projections are estimates regarding projected revenue growth rates, projected cost reductions and efficiencies, and projected long-term growth rates in the determination of terminal values.  

The Company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. The Company identifies unrecognized intangible assets, such as trade name and customer relationships, and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting units recognized and unrecognized intangible assets. The estimated values of the reporting units intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting units total value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is also recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.  

For the annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2008, the Company determined that the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values. A one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair values of the Companys reporting units, which were not deemed to be impaired based on the annual impairment testing in the third quarter, would not cause the carrying value of each respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value.  

For the impairment testing as of December 31, 2008, the economic events and circumstances that arose during the fourth quarter of 2008, and the associated impact on the outlooks for certain of the Companys reporting units, led the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge of $299.4 million principally related to goodwill of certain business units in the Tools & Hardware and Office Products segments.  

See Footnote 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base and net sales, a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers, or sustained declines in the Companys market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity. The Company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the Company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Companys total market capitalization periodically   

33  

Table of Contents 

 declined below the Companys December 31, 2008 consolidated stockholders equity balance. If the Companys total market capitalization is below consolidated stockholders equity balance at a future reporting date or for a sustained period, the Company considers this an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill. The Company utilizes market capitalization in corroborating its assessment of the fair value of its reporting units. As a result, the Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.  

Capitalized Software Costs  

The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Companys management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development. Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internal-use software. In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage. Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software. Capitalized software costs were $153.2 million at December 31, 2008. Capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of December 31, 2008.  

The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used. Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.  

Other Long-Lived Assets  

The Company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Companys strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.  

Product Liability Reserves  

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. The Company has product liability reserves of $42.5 million as of December 31, 2008. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Legal and Environmental Reserves  

The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters. The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into

 account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability (CERCLA) matters which are estimated at present value. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2008 ranged between $12.6 million and $30.3 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had a reserve of $15.1 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Income Taxes   

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested.  

The Companys income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.  

For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Companys ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Companys effective tax rate as well as impact operating results. See Footnote 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, discussed below:  

     Discount rates: The Company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high-quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The Company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities.  

     Health care cost trend rate: The Companys health-care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data, near term health care outlook, and industry benchmarks and surveys.  

     Expected return on plan assets: The Companys expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. The Companys analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns; however, the assumptions are primarily based on long-term, prospective rates of return.  

     Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience.  

     Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increases reflects the Companys long-term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation.  

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Companys pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated

The following table summarizes the net pre-tax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company used weighted average discount rates of 6.0% and 6.3% to determine the expenses for 2008 for the pension and post retirement plans, respectively. The Company used a weighted average expected return on assets of 7.9% to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2008. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and post retirement expenses, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The total projected benefit obligations of the Companys pension and post retirement plans as of December 31, 2008 were $1.26 billion and $162.5 million, respectively. The Company used weighted average discount rates of 6.2% and 6.3% to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and post retirement plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and post retirement plans, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company has $309.1 million (after-tax) of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses ($498.4 million pre-tax) included as a reduction to stockholders equity at December 31, 2008. The unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected. The unrecognized gain (loss) for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan. The net amount amortized to expense totaled $9.6 million (pre-tax) in 2008, and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future. Changes in actuarial assumptions, actual returns on plan assets, and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain (loss) recognized as expense annually.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008, as required for financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued Staff Position 157-2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157-2), which deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 for the Companys nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. SFAS 157 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

       Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

       Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  

       Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) significantly changes the accounting for business combination transactions by requiring an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value. Additionally, SFAS 141(R) modifies the accounting treatment for certain specified items related to business combinations and requires a substantial number of new disclosures. SFAS 141(R) is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company prospectively adopted SFAS 141(R) on January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) could have a material effect on the way the Company accounts for future acquisitions.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting requirements that require sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The Company prospectively adopted SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material effect on the way the Company accounts for acquisitions of minority interests by requiring the acquisitions of minority interests to be considered equity transactions rather than as acquisitions of net assets or liabilities.  

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment to FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable investors to better understand how derivative instruments are accounted for under SFAS 133 and their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 161 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP SFAS 142-3). FSP SFAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider when developing renewal or extension assumptions for determining the useful lives of recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). FSP SFAS 142-3 is intended to improve the consistency between the useful lives of recognized intangible assets under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of acquired assets. The guidance also requires expanded disclosure related to an entitys intangible assets. The guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements shall be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the effective date. FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP SFAS 142-3 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.  

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 162 became effective on November 13, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.  

In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03-06-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-06-1). This Staff Position provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03-06-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those years and requires all prior-period earnings per share data to be adjusted retrospectively. FSP EITF 03-06-1 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP EITF 03-06-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

In November 2008, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 08-7, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets (EITF 08-7). EITF 08-7 clarifies the accounting for certain separately identifiable intangible assets which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them. EITF 08-7 requires an acquirer in a business combination to account for a defensive intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting which should be amortized to expense over the period the asset diminishes in value. EITF 08-7 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company prospectively adopted EITF 08-7 on January 1, 2009. The adoption of EITF 08-7 could have a material effect on the way the Company accounts for acquired intangible assets.  

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP SFAS 132(R)-1). FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefitsan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106 (SFAS 132(R)), to require additional disclosures about assets held in an employers defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan using the guidance in SFAS 157. FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 also amends SFAS 157 to clarify that defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan assets are not subject to disclosure requirements under SFAS 157. FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

International Operations  

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Companys non-U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 31%, 28% and 26% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
