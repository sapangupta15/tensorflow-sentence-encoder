Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company," "IPG," "we," "us" or "our"). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. Our MD&A includes the following sections:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds, and debt credit ratings.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2017 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our organic revenue increase in 2017 was driven by growth throughout most of our geographic regions, which was primarily a result of growth with existing clients. The growth in our domestic market was primarily driven by our media and advertising disciplines. Our international organic increase was primarily driven by strong growth within our media discipline, with notable contributions from Continental Europe and our Other region, primarily in Canada. The Asia Pacific region weighed on our international growth, mainly due to a challenging and competitive market within our advertising discipline. We continued to have increased growth in demand for our full range of services, including media, creative and marketing services across most of our regional markets. We carefully managed our operating expenses, which reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio, service our existing clients and grow our capabilities.

Overall demand for our services by clients remains solid, though our growth slowed in 2017 relative to its strong pace in recent years due to challenging comparable performance over the last three years, and to caution on the part of some large marketers that characterized our industry in 2017. We continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base, our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. We continued to enhance our businesses during 2017 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities: fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions, creative talent and strategic world markets. We believe our continued investment in tools, technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services.

We continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends, share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet. Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.49, $1.53 and $1.11 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.46, $1.49 and $1.09 per share, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a net positive impact of $0.09 per share as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as discussed in further detail in the Income Taxes section of our MD&A. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a negative impact of $0.04 per share from net losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a net positive impact of $0.20 per share from various tax items as discussed in further detail in the Income Taxes section of our MD&A. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included negative impacts of $0.10 and $0.12 per share, respectively, from net losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale.

The following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with the same periods in 2016 and 2015.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance, we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. The performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses, and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by geographic region and also by business sector, in which we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitute approximately 55% to 60% of our annual consolidated revenues. 

The change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. Our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency. Both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. The foreign currency that most adversely impacted our results during 2017 was the British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the Brazilian Real and South African Rand.

For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. During the past few years, we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results of Operations 

REVENUE

Our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. In the events marketing business, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. When we act as principal for these projects, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue, and the related costs are incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2017, our revenue increased by $35.8, or 0.5%, compared to 2016, comprised of an organic revenue increase of $138.9, or 1.8%, partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of $100.3 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $2.8. Our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to growth within the healthcare, auto, government and industrials sectors, partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom and the consumer packaged goods sectors. The organic increase in our domestic market was mainly driven by strong growth at our media and advertising businesses, partially offset by weakness in our public relations and digital specialist agencies. In our international markets, the organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth at our media businesses and public relations agencies across all regions and our advertising businesses in the United Kingdom, partially offset by decreases at our advertising businesses in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions and our events business in the United Kingdom, primarily as a result of certain projects where we no longer act as principal.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2016, our revenue increased by $232.8, or 3.1%, compared to 2015, comprised of an organic revenue increase of $377.2, or 5.0%, and the effect of net acquisitions of $15.3, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $159.7. Our organic revenue increase was throughout all geographic regions, attributable to a combination of higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in most client sectors, notably in the healthcare and technology and telecom sectors. The organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across nearly all disciplines, most notably at our digital specialist agencies and advertising businesses. In our international markets, the organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines, most notably at our media businesses in all geographic regions, primarily in Continental Europe, led by Germany, as well as our events business, where we had an increase in the United Kingdom offset by a decrease in the Asia Pacific region. Also contributing to our international organic revenue increase were our digital specialist agencies, primarily in the Latin America

region and the Other region, led by Canada, and our public relations agencies, primarily in the United Kingdom and the Asia Pacific region.

Refer to the segment discussion later in this MD&A for information on changes in revenue by segment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2017, our operating margin expanded to 12.4% from 12.0% in 2016, mainly driven by an increase in revenue of 0.5%, partially offset by a slight increase in total operating expenses. In 2016, our change in revenue of 3.1% from 2015 outpaced an increase in total operating expenses of 2.5%, resulting in operating margin expansion to 12.0% from 11.5%. Our operating income grew 3.5% in 2017 to $973.6, and 7.6% in 2016 to $941.0.

Salaries and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, costs for temporary workers, severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels; however, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel, including freelancers, to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards. Additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership. Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year in which they are earned, and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. Factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, assumptions regarding forfeiture rates, the change in our stock price, actual results and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Salaries and related expenses in 2017 increased by $33.0 compared to 2016, due to an organic increase of $102.3, partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of $65.2 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $4.1. The organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries, benefits and tax, partially offset by lower incentive expense and a decrease in acquisition-related contractual compensation, which is classified within all other salaries and related expenses in the table below. Our staff cost ratio, defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, slightly increased in 2017 to 64.3% from 64.2% when compared to the prior year.

 Salaries and related expenses in 2016 increased by $180.3 compared to 2015, due to an organic increase of $277.8 and the effect of net acquisitions of $2.2, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $99.7. The organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries, benefits and tax as a result of increases in our workforce at businesses and in regions where we had revenue growth or new business wins over the last twelve months, and higher long-term incentive awards expense, as a result of improved financial performance. Our staff cost ratio increased in 2016 to 64.2% from 63.8% in 2015.

The following table details our staff cost ratio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Office and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Office and general expenses in 2017 decreased by $29.8 compared to 2016, comprised of an organic increase of $9.4, the effect of net divestitures of $36.7 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $2.5. The organic increase was primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs, partially offset by decreases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations as compared to the prior year and lower production expenses related to pass-through costs. Our office and general expense ratio, defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, decreased in 2017 to 23.4% from 23.8% in 2016.

Office and general expenses in 2016 decreased by $13.7 compared to 2015, comprised of an organic increase of $38.6, a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $43.6 and the effect of net divestitures of $8.7.The organic increase was attributable to higher occupancy costs as well as increases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations, partially offset by lower production expenses related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, for certain projects that decreased in size or did not recur during 2016. Our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2016 to 23.8% from 24.7% in 2015.

The following table details our office and general expense ratio. All other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses, and, to a lesser extent, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations, foreign currency losses (gains), spending to support new business activity, net restructuring and other reorganization-related charges (reversals), long-lived asset impairments and other expenses.

Net Interest Expense

For 2017, net interest expense increased by $0.9 as compared to 2016. For 2016, net interest expense increased by $7.5 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased cash interest expense from uncommitted credit lines in order to meet working capital needs.

Other Expense, net

Net losses on sales of businesses – During 2017, the amounts recognized were primarily related to sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, as held for sale within our Integrated Agency Networks ("IAN") operating segment. The businesses held for sale as of year end primarily represent unprofitable, non-strategic agencies which are expected to be sold within the next twelve months. During 2016, the amounts recognized were related to sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable, as held for sale within both our IAN and Constituency Management Group ("CMG") segments. During 2015, the amounts recognized were related to sales of businesses within both our IAN and CMG segments and the classification of certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable, as held for sale within our IAN segment. 

INCOME TAXES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income. Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act legislated many new tax provisions which have impacted our operations, including the reduction of the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective in 2018, a current tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and a U.S tax exemption for future distributions of certain foreign earnings.

U.S. GAAP requires the income tax accounting effect of a change in tax law, including the effects on current and deferred income taxes, to be reflected in the period in which such law is enacted. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") on December 22, 2017, which acknowledges that the information necessary to determine such income tax effects may not be sufficiently available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting under U.S. GAAP. SAB 118 allows 

22
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

for the reporting of provisional amounts for those specific tax effects for which a reasonable estimate can be made, and for no amounts to be recorded where a reasonable estimate cannot be made. Any subsequent adjustments to reported amounts will be made over the measurement period, which begins in the reporting period that includes the Tax Act's enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information that is needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under U.S. GAAP, not to exceed one year from the enactment date.

We have reasonably estimated the tax effect of re-measuring our deferred tax balances and reserves at year end to reflect the tax effect of the reversal of such deferred tax balances in future periods during which the U.S. federal income tax rate will be 21.0%. We have recorded a decrease related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, with a corresponding provisional net benefit to our deferred income taxes of $104.7. The Tax Act’s various changes to the treatment of fixed assets and deferred compensation are sufficiently complex to conclude that an adjustment may be necessary.

The Tax Act also imposes a tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings at various tax rates. We have reasonably estimated the tax effect of this deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and have recorded tax expense of $62.3 as a provisional amount due to the fact that necessary information could not be attained, prepared or analyzed on a timely basis to be able to complete the calculations. The complexity of the rules and the comprehensive data requirements will likely result in some adjustment to the provisional amount. The Company expects to pay this amount over the next eight years, as further detailed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Additionally, the Tax Act imposes a new tax on certain foreign earnings generated in 2018 and forward. We are continuing to evaluate these global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") tax rules, which are extremely complex. U.S. GAAP allows us to choose between an accounting policy which treats the U.S. tax under GILTI provisions as either a current expense, as incurred, or as a component of the Company’s measurement of deferred taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of the GILTI rules due to the significant complexity of the rules and the fact that the information necessary could not be attained, prepared or analyzed on a timely basis. Therefore, we have not made any adjustment related to the potential GILTI tax and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes thereon.

Finally, as per interpretive guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury on February 13, 2018, a tax benefit of $31.2, which was recorded during the third quarter of 2017, was reversed during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Act.

Effective Tax Rate

In 2017, our effective income tax rate of 32.2% was positively impacted by a net benefit of $36.0 as a result of the Tax Act, the primary impacts of which are discussed above, as well as excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments, partially offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances.

In 2016, our effective income tax rate of 23.8% was positively impacted by a benefit of $44.6 related to refunds to be claimed on future amended U.S. federal returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 primarily related to foreign tax credits and, to a lesser extent, research and development credits based on the conclusion of multi-year studies; the settlement of 2011 and 2012 income tax audits, which included the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits of $23.4; the reversal of valuation allowances of $12.2 as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses in Continental Europe; excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments; and various changes in state income tax laws as well as the recognition of previously unrecognized state tax benefits as a result of a lapse in statute of limitations. The positive impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by a revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of a statutory tax rate change in Continental Europe, losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and by losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit.

In 2015, our effective income tax rate of 37.1% was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and from the losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit. The negative impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances in Continental Europe and the settlement of a 2010 income tax audit.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.49, $1.53 and $1.11 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.46, $1.49 and $1.09 per share, respectively.

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a negative impact of $0.04 per share from losses on sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets as held for sale, offset by a net positive impact of $0.09

per share as a result of the Tax Act. Further information on the impacts of the Tax Act is included in the Income Taxes section of this MD&A and Note 7 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a net positive impact of $0.20 per share from the various tax items previously quantified in the Income Taxes section of this MD&A, partially offset by a negative impact of $0.10 per share from losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 included a negative impact of $0.12 per share from losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale.

Segment Results of Operations 

As discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2017: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the "Corporate and other" group.

IAN

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2017, IAN revenue increased by $77.9 compared to 2016, comprised of an organic revenue increase of $139.1 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $6.5, partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of $67.7. The organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to growth within the healthcare sector, partially offset by decreases in the financial services and technology and telecom sectors. The organic increase in our domestic market was mainly driven by strong growth at our media and advertising businesses, partially offset by a decline within our digital specialist agencies. In our international markets, the organic increase was primarily driven by strong growth at our media businesses across all regions, most notably in Canada within our Other region and in Germany, as well as our advertising businesses in the United Kingdom, partially offset by decreases at our advertising businesses in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. The organic growth in our media and advertising businesses was also positively impacted by the achievement of contractual performance-related incentives.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2016, IAN revenue increased by $174.0 compared to 2015, comprised of an organic revenue increase of $324.5, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $128.8 and the effect of net divestitures of $21.7. The organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to a combination of higher spending and net client wins in most client sectors, most notably in the healthcare sector. The organic revenue increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across all disciplines, most notably at our digital specialist agencies and advertising businesses. The international organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines, most notably at our media businesses in all geographic regions, primarily in Continental Europe, led by Germany, and our Other region, primarily in Canada, and our digital specialist agencies in the Latin America region and Canada.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income increased during 2017 when compared to 2016, due to an increase in revenue of $77.9, as discussed above, and a decrease in office and general expenses of $4.0, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of $72.7. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and tax, partially offset by lower incentive expense. The decrease in office and general expenses was attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, and a gain on the sale of an asset, partially offset by higher occupancy costs.

Operating income increased during 2016 when compared to 2015 due to an increase in revenue of $174.0, as discussed above, and a decrease in office and general expenses of $2.7, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of $128.8. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and tax as well as temporary help, primarily attributable to increases in our workforce at businesses and in regions where we had revenue growth or new business wins over the last twelve months. The decrease in office and general expenses was attributable to lower charges for contingencies and lower professional consulting fees, partially offset by higher occupancy costs and increases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations as compared to the prior year.

CMG

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2017, CMG revenue decreased by $42.1 compared to 2016, comprised of a slight decrease in organic revenue of $0.2, the effect of net divestitures of $32.6 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $9.3. The organic revenue decrease in our domestic market was mainly driven by decreases in our public relations agencies and branding businesses, partially offset by growth at our sports marketing businesses. In our international markets, the organic increase was primarily driven by growth at our public relations and sports marketing businesses across all regions, partially offset by a decrease in pass-through revenue related to certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur in our events business in 2017, most notably in the United Kingdom, the impact of which is also reflected as a comparable reduction in office and general expenses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2016, CMG revenue increased by $58.8 compared to 2015, comprised of an organic revenue increase of $52.7 and the effect of net acquisitions of $37.0, largely offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $30.9. The organic revenue increase in our international markets was driven by our public relations businesses, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, as well as our events business, where we had an increase in the United Kingdom offset by a decrease in the Asia Pacific region. The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our public relations businesses, primarily in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors, offset by a decline in our events marketing business.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating income increased during 2017 when compared to 2016, comprised of a decrease in revenue of $42.1, as discussed above, a decrease in salaries and related expenses of $28.0 and a decrease in office and general expenses of $16.9. The decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary bonuses and incentive expense as well as a decrease in base salaries, benefits and tax. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to decreases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations, as compared to the prior year.

Operating income increased during 2016 when compared to 2015 due to an increase in revenue of $58.8, as discussed above, and a decrease in office and general expenses of $3.7, partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of $38.8. The increase in salaries and related expenses was attributable to an increase in base salaries, benefits and tax primarily due to increases in our workforce to support business growth over the last twelve months. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, for certain projects in which we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur during the current year.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses, as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office. Office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization.

Corporate and other expenses decreased during 2017 by $20.6 to $126.6 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower annual incentive expense. Corporate and other expenses increased during 2016 by $5.4 to $147.2 compared to 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, net losses on sales of businesses and deferred income taxes.

2Reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Operating Activities

Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year, with the largest impact in the first quarter, and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter, driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients. Quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries.

26
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved, which substantially exceed our revenues, primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 was $881.8, which was an increase of $369.0 as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of $385.0. Working capital in 2017 benefited from the spending patterns of our clients compared to 2016.

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 was $512.8, which was a decrease of $175.7 as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in working capital usage of $315.0. Our net working capital usage in 2016 was primarily attributable to our media businesses and the shifting of several clients’ media spending budgets into the third quarter from the fourth quarter in 2016, and the corresponding payments to media suppliers thereafter.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities during 2017 primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of $155.9, related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software.

Net cash used in investing activities during 2016 primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of $200.7, related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software, and payments for acquisitions of $52.0, net of cash acquired.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily driven by the redemption of all $300.0 in aggregate principal amount of the 2.25% Senior Notes due 2017, the repurchase of 13.7 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $300.1, including fees, and the payment of dividends of $280.3.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily driven by the repurchase of 13.3 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $303.3, including fees, and the payment of dividends of $238.4.

Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in an increase of $16.8 in 2017, primarily a result of the Australian Dollar strengthening against the U.S. Dollar as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in an increase of $11.6 in 2016, primarily a result of the Brazilian Real strengthening against the U.S. Dollar as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK

We expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We also have a committed corporate credit facility, uncommitted lines of credit and a commercial paper program available to support our operating needs. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

From time to time, we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit ratings, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity, or continue to access existing sources of liquidity, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Funding Requirements 

Our most significant funding requirements include our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock dividends, taxes and debt service. Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests.

Notable funding requirements include: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

5Amounts represent the taxes to be paid to the U.S. federal government related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. We will elect to pay the amounts above over an eight-year period.

Share Repurchase Program

In February 2017, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2017 Share Repurchase Program"), which was in addition to the remaining amount available to 

28
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

be repurchased from the $300.0 authorization made by the Board in February 2016 (the "2016 Share Repurchase Program"). We fully utilized the 2016 Share Repurchase Program during the third quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, $155.5 remained available for repurchase under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.

On February 14, 2018, we announced that our Board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. The new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining for repurchase under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs.

We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means. We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods, although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements.

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries. Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.

At December 31, 2017, we held $598.4 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries. The Company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, and therefore had not recorded deferred taxes on such amounts. The Tax Act provides a U.S. tax exemption for dividends of certain foreign earnings. The Tax Act may provide additional flexibility in the Company’s tax-efficient access to global cash, but is expected to have limited impact to net domestic liquidity. The Company is still evaluating whether to continue its indefinite reinvestment assertion, in light of the Tax Act. The evaluation is not yet complete. Any change to the assertion will be accounted for as part of the change in tax law.

Credit Agreements

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility which has been amended and restated from time to time (the "Credit Agreement"). We use our Credit Agreement to increase our financial flexibility, to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, expiring in October 2022, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,500.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company has the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $50.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement; however, we had $8.4 of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which reduced our total availability to $1,491.6.

Under the Credit Agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the Eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margin was 0.10% for base rate advances and 1.10% for Eurocurrency rate advances. Letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0.25%. We also pay a facility fee at an annual rate that is determined based on our credit ratings, which as of December 31, 2017, was 0.15% on the aggregate lending commitment under the Credit Agreement.

The table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of December 31, 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1The interest coverage ratio is defined as EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to net interest expense for the four quarters then ended. The leverage ratio is defined as debt as of the last day of such fiscal quarter to EBITDA for the four quarters then ended.

As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement. If we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that 

29
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. If we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility.

We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of $926.2, under which we had outstanding borrowings of $84.9 classified as short-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The average amount outstanding during 2017 was $223.8, with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 2.9%.

Commercial Paper

In June 2017, the Company established a commercial paper program under which the Company was authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1,000.0, which was increased to $1,500.0 on October 25, 2017. Borrowings under the program are supported by the Credit Agreement described above. Proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2017, there was no commercial paper outstanding. From the date the program was first utilized through December 31, 2017, the average amount outstanding under the program was $477.4, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.5% and a weighted-average maturity of seventeen days.

Cash Pooling

We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 the amounts netted were $1,412.0 and $1,300.6, respectively.

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS

Our debt credit ratings as of February 14, 2018 are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We are rated investment-grade by Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings. In June 2017, we received from the credit rating agencies the short-term credit ratings, set forth above, with respect to our commercial paper. The most recent update to our long-term credit ratings occurred in April 2017 when S&P Global Ratings upgraded our rating from BBB- to BBB with a Stable outlook. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, because, among other things, they could affect funding costs in, or the ability to access, the capital markets or otherwise. For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a long-term credit ratings grid.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed 

30
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities, and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods.

The majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs. We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses. In general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as “out-of-pocket” expenses. These expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges. We record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could significantly affect our reported results. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned.

In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance on revenue recognition which requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. We have elected to adopt the standard, effective January 1, 2018, using the 

31
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

full retrospective method. The standard, which accelerates the recognition of revenue primarily as a result of estimating variable consideration, mostly impacts the timing of revenue recognition between quarters, but also can affect, to a lesser extent, the amount of annual revenue recognized. Although we have determined that the standard results in an increase in the number of performance obligations within certain of our contractual arrangements, this is not expected to materially impact the amount or timing of revenue recognized. The standard will also result in an increase in third party costs of approximately $1,100.0 to $1,300.0 being included in revenue and costs, primarily in connection with our events businesses, which has no impact on operating income, net income or cash flows. The increase to retained earnings as of December 31, 2017 as a result of adopting the standard is not material.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change.

In response to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC issued SAB 118 on December 22, 2017, which acknowledges that the information necessary to determine such income tax effects may not be sufficiently available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting under U.S. GAAP. SAB 118 allows for the reporting of provisional amounts for those specific tax effects for which a reasonable estimate can be made, and for no amounts to be recorded where a reasonable estimate cannot be made. Any subsequent adjustments to reported amounts will be made over the measurement period, which begins in the reporting period that includes the Tax Act's enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information that is needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under U.S. GAAP, not to exceed one year from the enactment date. We have reasonably estimated and recorded provisional amounts resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings. A valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence, such as past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance. Conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings.

The authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate 

32
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 11 reporting units that were subject to the 2017 annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2017 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units. 

In performing our annual impairment review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. Qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as pending litigation. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value. Otherwise, no additional testing is required.

For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the quantitative impairment test is failed, and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.

For our 2017 and 2016 annual impairment tests, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for eight and seven reporting units and performed the quantitative impairment test for three and four reporting units, respectively. For the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, macroeconomic conditions and entity-specific factors such as client wins and losses. Based on this assessment, we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment, it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value; therefore, no additional testing was required.

The 2017 and 2016 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.

These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For the 2017 test, the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested was 11.5%, and the terminal value growth rate was 3.0%. The terminal value growth rate represents the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy. For the 2017 test, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 2.0% and 6.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

We also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 0.5%. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test.

The table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2017 and 2016 annual impairment tests, indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20%. When factoring in a 0.5% increase in discount rate, our results of the 2017 and 2016 tests indicate that the fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20% for all reporting units, except for reporting unit B whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 17.5% in 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Based on the analysis described above, for the reporting units for which we performed the quantitative impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of October 1, 2017, because these reporting units passed the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values.

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. These assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. Management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. We determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond yield curve approach. Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate.

The discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, discount rates of 4.20% for the domestic pension plan and 4.05% for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weighted-average discount rate of 2.52% for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2017 net pension and postretirement benefit costs. A 25 basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2017 net pension and postretirement benefit cost by $0.2.

The discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year. As of December 31, 2017, we used discount rates of 3.70% for the domestic pension plan and 3.65% for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weighted-average discount rate of 2.36% for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations. A 25 basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2017 benefit obligation by approximately $28.0 and $30.0, respectively.

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.

For 2017, the weighted-average expected rates of return of 7.00% and 4.66% were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2018, we plan to use expected rates of return of 7.00% and 4.70% for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. Changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. A lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension
