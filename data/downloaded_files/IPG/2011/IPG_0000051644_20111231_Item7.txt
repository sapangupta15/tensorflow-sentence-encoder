Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“IPG,” “we,” “us” or “our”). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. Our MD&A includes the following sections:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2011 compared to 2010 and 2010 compared to 2009.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing and sources of funds and debt credit ratings.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2011 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During 2011, we had strong revenue and profit growth. Our revenue grew at all major businesses and client sectors, and in nearly every major region of the world. We continued to build our businesses by making investments in talent and acquisitions that emphasize our growth priorities: fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth regions and the largest world markets. We greatly improved our operating profitability again in 2011, as seen in the progress of our operating margin for the full year. Early in the year, as a direct result of improvements in our operating performance and financial strength, we initiated both a dividend on our common shares and a program of share repurchases that we expanded during the year. 

Overall demand for our services by clients remains solid. With challenging economic conditions in some parts of the world, marketers continue to show a measure of caution as well. In this complex global environment, we find that we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base, our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. We believe the investment in tools, technology and process improvements we have made in recent years, and which continue, will allow us to grow increasingly more efficient in the delivery of our services. As we continue to evolve our services at a rapid pace, we believe we are positioned for revenue growth and continued strong margin expansion. The following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared with the same periods in 2010 and 2009.

When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. The performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector, where we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitutes approximately 55%-60% of our annual consolidated revenues. We also analyze revenue by geographic region.

The change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk. Our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency. Both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. The primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2011 include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Japanese Yen and Pound Sterling. During 2011, the U.S. Dollar was weaker as compared to all foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prior-year period, which had a positive impact on our revenue and operating income. For 2011, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 2% in revenues and operating expenses, which had no impact on our operating margin percentage. For 2010, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 1% in revenues and operating expenses, which also had no impact on our operating margin percentage. In recent months, the U.S. Dollar has strengthened against certain currencies, and at current exchange rates, the result would be a slight negative impact on our 2012 revenue and operating income.

For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. During the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. For 2011 and 2010, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures had a minimal impact on revenue and operating expenses compared to the respective prior-year period. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising, marketing and communications programs in various media around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements. Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. 

The majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs. We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses. In general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments. If we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned. Income or

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2004 Restatement”). In these situations, and given the historical nature of these liabilities, we generally record such items as other income or expense as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes.

We are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings. A valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance. Conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance. Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of $32.9 and $2.4, respectively. In 2009, we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of $12.4. 

The authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using the prescribed “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We have accounted for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method beginning in 2009, while we utilized the purchase accounting method in prior years. Both accounting methods require us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 11 reporting units that were subject to the 2011 annual impairment testing. Our reporting unit structure did not change during 2011. Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1, 2011 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units.

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. These assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

We have adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as contemplation of bankruptcy or pending litigation. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the entity is required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test to identify and measure impairment, if necessary. Otherwise, no additional testing is required.

For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.

For our 2011 annual impairment test, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for nine reporting units and performed the two-step quantitative impairment test for two reporting units. For the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances in accordance with the authoritative guidance, including financial performance, macroeconomic conditions and entity-specific factors such as client wins/losses. Based on this assessment, we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment, it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value; therefore, no additional testing was required.

The 2011 and 2010 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We primarily applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.

These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For 2011, the discount rate we used for both of our reporting units tested was 12.5%, and the terminal value growth rate for both of our reporting units tested was 3.0%. The terminal value growth rate represents the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy. For 2011, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 5.0% and 6.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 0.5% and increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 0.5% and decreases discount rates by 0.5%. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test.

The following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2011 and 2010 annual impairment tests and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end, average and high end of the valuation range for a) fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10%, b) fair values exceeding carrying values between 10% and 20% and c) fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20%. In 2011 and 2010, our results for the comparison between carrying value

and fair value at the low end, average and high end of the valuation range indicated that there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair value.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 We did not test nine reporting units in 2011 because, based on a qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not "more likely than not" that the fair value was less than its carrying amount for each of these reporting units.

2 We did not test five reporting units in 2010 because we determined we could carry forward the fair value of the reporting unit from previous annual tests, as the fair value significantly exceeded the book value.

The table above displays the information related to our 2011 and 2010 annual impairment tests. We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test. In 2011, our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that there were no reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the low and high end of the valuation range. Using both the low end and high end of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. 

For 2010, using the average fair value there was one reporting unit, with $150.0 of associated goodwill, whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%. Using the low end of the valuation range, there were two reporting units, with $589.2 of associated goodwill, whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. Using the high end of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. Management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. At December 31, 2011, we determined our discount rates for our domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond-yield curve approach. Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. Using the bond-yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate. Weighted-average discount rates of 5.50%, 5.45% and 5.50% were used in the calculation of 2011 net pension and postretirement benefit costs for the domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement 

20

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

benefit plan, respectively. A lower discount rate would increase our net pension and postretirement benefit costs. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2011 net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately $1.0 and $2.0, respectively.

At December 31, 2011, we used a discount rate of 5.00% for the domestic pension and domestic postretirement benefit plans and a weighted-average discount rate of 5.00% for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2011 benefit obligation by approximately $22.0 and $23.0, respectively. 

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.

For 2011, the weighted-average expected rates of return of 7.50% and 5.88% were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2012, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 7.25% and 5.02% for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively. Changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held. A lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2011 net pension cost by approximately $1.0.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results of Operations 

REVENUE

Our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter. In the events marketing business, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete. We generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, our revenue increased by $507.3, or 7.8%, compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $393.7, or 6.1%, and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $122.2. Our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients across all major client sectors and throughout nearly all geographic regions, led by the domestic market. The sectors that primarily contributed to our organic revenue increase were technology and telecom, and auto and transportation. In the international markets, the most notable organic revenue increases occurred in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil, in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and India, and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom. The Continental Europe region was essentially flat as results varied by European country due to a challenging economic climate in the region.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2010, our revenue increased by $499.9, or 8.3%, compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $419.6, or 7.0%, and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $63.3. The organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in nearly all sectors of our business and throughout most geographic regions, led by the domestic market. The sectors which contributed the most to our organic revenue increase were auto and transportation and financial services. The auto and transportation, financial services, and technology and telecom sectors were the primary sectors that were negatively impacted by the global recession in 2009. Although our technology and telecom sector experienced a slight organic revenue decrease for the full year 2010, this sector had an organic revenue increase in the second half of 2010 as the impact of certain lost assignments in the prior year diminished. Our international organic revenue increase was most notably in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil, in our Other region, which includes South Africa, Canada and the Middle East, and in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and India. The United Kingdom was essentially flat as the organic revenue increase in the second half of the year offset declines in the first half of 2010. This organic revenue increase in the United Kingdom, as well as the increase in Brazil, was partially attributable to growth in the consumer goods sector. There was an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Italy, Germany and Spain, which included the impact of a weakened economic climate in certain European countries. 

Refer to the segment discussion later in this MD&A for information on changes in revenue by segment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Salaries and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards. Additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance. Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years. Factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, the change in our stock price and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our staff cost ratio, defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, decreased in 2011 to 62.8% from 63.3% in 2010. Salaries and related expenses in 2011 increased by $285.1 compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $209.1 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $74.9. The organic increase in salaries and related expenses of 5.1% was lower than our organic revenue increase of 6.1% due to our cost discipline during the year. The organic increase was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth, resulting in an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $189.4. Hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011. Also contributing to the organic increase, but to a lesser extent, was higher incentive award expense primarily due to continued improvement in operating results in 2011. The organic increase occurred across all regions, primarily in our domestic market.

Our staff cost ratio decreased in 2010 to 63.3% from 65.9% in 2009. Salaries and related expenses in 2010 increased by $155.8 compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $116.2 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $32.6. The organic increase was due to higher temporary help of $54.8 incurred to support business growth. Also contributing to the organic increase was higher incentive award expense of $67.7 and, to a lesser extent, other discretionary bonus awards, primarily due to improved operating results in 2010. This is in contrast to 2009 where we had lower incentive award expense due to lower operating performance, primarily as a result of difficult economic conditions. The organic increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily in our domestic market and certain international regions with improved operating results. In locations where we had organic revenue decreases, such as various countries in the Continental Europe region, we had lower salaries and related expenses due to large workforce reductions taken in 2009 as well as additional actions taken in 2010. The increases in salaries and related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in severance expense of $67.6 compared to the prior year.

The following table details our staff cost ratio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Office and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff, and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.

Our office and general expense ratio, defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, decreased in 2011 to 27.4% from 28.2% in 2010. Office and general expenses in 2011 increased by $86.6 compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $57.2 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $34.3. The organic increase was primarily attributable to continued business growth in 2011, which resulted in higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2011. Also contributing

to the organic increase, but to a lesser extent, was higher discretionary spending to support business growth.

Our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2010 to 28.2% from 28.3% in 2009. Office and general expenses in 2010 increased by $137.4 compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic increase of $110.6 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of $20.9. The organic increase was primarily due to higher production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2010 as compared to 2009. The remainder of the organic increase was due to higher discretionary spending to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 related to our Venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of January 1, 2010. The organic increase was partially offset by lower occupancy costs, which was partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009.

The following table details our office and general expense ratio. All other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses, and, to a lesser extent, depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, foreign currency gains (losses) and other expenses.

Net Interest Expense

For 2011, net interest expense decreased by $12.0 as compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in interest income. Interest income increased primarily due to an increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances and an increase in average interest rates in certain countries around the world compared to the prior-year period. Interest expense decreased primarily due to repayment of debt obligations in 2010, partially offset by higher interest expense in certain countries outside of the United States.

For 2010, net interest expense decreased by $9.6 as compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in non-cash interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The reduction in non-cash interest expense was due to no longer amortizing deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs that were associated with our $750.0 Three-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2006, which expired in June 2009. Interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower domestic interest rates compared to 2009.

Other Income, net

Results of operations include certain items which are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of Businesses and Investments – This item primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses and investments, cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our Rabbi Trusts. During 2011, we received net proceeds of $133.5 from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, Inc. (the "Facebook transaction"), a cost-method investment, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $132.2. Additionally, during 2011, we recognized a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our Integrated Agency Networks ("IAN") segment. During 2010, we recognized a gain relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our Constituency Management Group ("CMG") segment, which was partially offset by a loss recognized relating to the sale of one our European businesses within our IAN segment. During 2009, we realized a gain relating to the sale of an investment in our Rabbi Trusts, which was partially offset by losses realized from the sale of various businesses.

Net Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt – During 2009, we recorded a net charge of $25.1 primarily related to the settlement of our tender offers for certain outstanding debt securities.

Vendor Discounts and Credit Adjustments – We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the 2004 Restatement. These adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed. 

INCOME TAXES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income. In 2011, our effective income tax rate of 25.8% was positively impacted primarily from the utilization of capital losses to offset nearly all of the $132.2 capital gain realized from the Facebook transaction. The capital gain enabled us to use capital loss carryforwards, on which a 100% valuation allowance had been previously established, and capital losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the 2007-2008 IRS audit cycle, a lower effective income tax rate on non-U.S. operations and the net reversal of valuation allowances, primarily in Europe. The effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by state and local taxes and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. The settlement of the 2007-2008 audit cycle resulted in no cash payment. 

In 2010, our effective income tax rate of 38.0% was positively impacted by reversals of valuation allowances in Canada and the United Kingdom. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the taxation of foreign operations, which included an income tax assessment in Latin America. During 2010, we effectively settled with the United Kingdom tax authorities for the 2007 and 2008 tax years, which resulted in no cash payment. Also in 2010, we effectively settled our New York State examination for the 1999-2001 tax years. This settlement resulted in a cash payment of $11.7 consisting of $5.4 of tax and $6.3 of interest, which was previously reserved.

In 2009, our effective income tax rate of 38.8% was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, net, which includes the recognition of tax benefits on partially worthless securities of $10.7. Our effective income tax

rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances, the establishment of valuation allowances in the Asia Pacific region and the write-off of deferred tax assets related to restricted stock. During 2009, we finalized our proceedings with the IRS appeals division for the 1997-2002 and 2003-2004 audit cycles. We also finalized our IRS examination for the 2005-2006 audit cycle. As a result, we recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $50.1 related to various items of income and expense, primarily attributable to transfer pricing adjustments and adjustments relating to the 2004 Restatement.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $1.12, $0.57 and $0.20 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $0.99, $0.47 and $0.19 per share, respectively.

Segment Results of Operations 

As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2011: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the Corporate and other group. 

IAN

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, IAN revenue increased by $423.4 compared to 2010, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $291.8 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $106.9. The increase in revenue at our IAN segment represented approximately 74% of the total organic revenue increase. The organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients in all major client sectors, across our advertising and media businesses and in nearly all geographic regions, led by the domestic market. The sectors which primarily contributed to the organic revenue increase were technology and telecom, and, to a lesser extent, auto and transportation. The international organic increase occurred predominantly in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil, and in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in India and China. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, which was impacted by a challenging economic climate in the region.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2010, IAN revenue increased by $406.7 compared to 2009, primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of $331.7 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $58.4. The increase in revenue at our IAN segment represented approximately 79% of the total organic revenue increase. The organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in most sectors of our business, primarily in the auto and transportation, financial services, and health care sectors, and in nearly all regions, across our advertising and media businesses. The international organic increase was primarily

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

in the Latin America region, mostly in Brazil, and in our Other region, which includes South Africa, Canada and the Middle East. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by organic decreases in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Italy, Germany and Spain, which included the effect of a weakened economic climate in certain European countries.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating income increased during 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in revenue of $423.4, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $238.7 and office and general expenses of $73.5. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth, which resulted in an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help across nearly all agencies within IAN. Hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs and, to a lesser extent, higher discretionary spending and higher production expenses due to business growth. 

Operating income increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in revenue of $406.7, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $128.5 and in office and general expenses of $84.0. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to higher temporary help across most of the agencies within IAN to support their business growth, as well as higher incentive award expense attributable to improved operating results in 2010. These increases were partially offset by lower severance expense compared to the prior year. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher discretionary spending and employment costs to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 related to our Venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of January 1, 2010. The increase in office and general expenses was partially offset by lower occupancy costs, which were partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009.

CMG

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, CMG revenue increased by $83.9 compared to 2010, consisting of an organic revenue increase of $101.9 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of $15.3, partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of $33.3. The organic revenue increase was primarily due to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins which occurred in most disciplines, primarily in our public relations and events marketing businesses, in both our domestic and international markets. The international organic increase was most significant in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China and Australia, and in the United Kingdom. The organic revenue increase includes higher revenue related to certain projects where we act as principal, primarily in our events marketing business. The reduction in revenue due to net divestitures primarily relates to the sale of a business in our domestic market in the fourth quarter of 2010. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2010, CMG revenue increased by $93.2 compared to 2009, primarily due to an organic revenue increase of $87.9. The organic revenue increase was due to net client wins and higher spending from existing clients in all major disciplines, primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses, and predominantly in the domestic market. These increases include the

impact of higher revenue related to certain projects where we act as principal, primarily in our events marketing business. The international organic increase occurred primarily in the Asia Pacific region, most notably in China and in our public relations and events marketing businesses.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating income increased during 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in revenue of $83.9, partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of $35.6 and office and general expenses of $27.2. Salaries and related expenses increased across all disciplines primarily due to business growth, which resulted in an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses associated with business growth. 

Operating income increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in revenue of $93.2, partially offset by increases in office and general expenses of $56.0 and salaries and related expenses of $30.0. Office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses. Increases in salaries and related expenses were primarily due to higher base salaries, benefits and temporary help in all major disciplines commensurate with regional growth and related increased headcount, as well as an increase in incentive award expense due to improved operating results. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees. Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services, which are engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition, office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of these expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. 

Corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during 2011 by $3.3 to $142.0 compared to 2010, primarily due to lower occupancy costs, partially offset by an increase in temporary help and severance expense. 

Corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during 2010 by $5.3 to $145.3 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower base salaries, benefits and temporary help as a result of work force reductions in 2009, and decreases in various other corporate expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in incentive award expense driven by improved consolidated operating results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of an investment.

2 Reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was $273.5, which is a decrease of $543.8 as compared to 2010, primarily as a result of a use of cash from working capital in 2011 of $359.4 as compared to a generation in 2010 of $263.2. Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year, with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we had significant cash generation from working capital, primarily due to a high rate of growth in our media businesses, which resulted in comparable working capital usage in the first quarter of 2011. Our net working capital use in 2011 was also impacted by slower growth in those same businesses compared to the prior year.

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was $817.3, which was an improvement of $276.5 as compared to 2009, as a result of an increase in net income of $137.8 as well as an improvement in working capital of $164.3. The increased generation of working capital in 2010 was primarily attributable to business growth, most notably at our media businesses.

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients and accounts payable. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. 

Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by the net proceeds of $133.5 received from the Facebook transaction. Capital expenditures of $140.3 relate primarily to computer software and hardware, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures increased in 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year. Payments for acquisitions of $63.1 

29
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

relate to new acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily reflects payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures of $96.3 relate to leasehold improvements, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures. Payments for acquisitions of $61.9 relate to new acquisitions, primarily DLKW, as well as deferred payments on prior acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2011 primarily relates to the repurchase of 41.7 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $400.8, including fees. Additionally, net cash used in financing activities includes dividend payments of $111.1 on our common stock and acquisition-related payments of $71.5, primarily related to transactions with consolidated subsidiaries where we have increased our ownership interests.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2010 includes the repurchase of a portion of our Series B Preferred Stock for $265.9 in cash, payments of long-term debt of $217.3, primarily as a result of the maturity of our Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010, acquisition-related payments of $29.5, primarily related to transactions with consolidated subsidiaries where we increased our ownership interests, distributions to noncontrolling interests of $21.5 and dividend payments of $19.6 on our Series B Preferred Stock. 

Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of $46.7 in 2011. The decrease was a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Euro and Brazilian Real, as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010.

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in an increase of $19.4 in 2010. The increase was a result of the U.S. Dollar being weaker than several foreign currencies, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar being stronger than the Euro, as of December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK

We expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We also have a committed corporate credit facility available to support our operating needs. We continue to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends. 

From time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

Funding Requirements 

Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, taxes, debt service and contributions to pension and postretirement plans. Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options arising from prior acquisitions to sell us their interests. Notable funding requirements include:

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 

•Acquisitions – We paid cash of $31.1, which was net of cash acquired of $17.5, for acquisitions completed in 2011. We paid $36.7 of deferred payments related to acquisitions completed in previous years and $68.3 related to transactions with consolidated subsidiaries where we increased our ownership interests in 2011. In addition to potential cash expenditures for new acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately $41.0 in 2012 related to acquisitions we completed in previous years. We may also be required to pay approximately $6.0 in 2012 related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and to increase our ownership interests in current investments, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Amounts represent maturity at par. Holders of our $400.0 4.25% Notes may require us to repurchase their notes for cash at par in March 2012, and holders of our $200.0 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.75% Notes") may require us to repurchase their notes for cash, stock or a combination, at our election, at par in March 2013. All of these notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.

2 Non-cancelable operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements.

3 We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations based on the future performance of the acquired entity. See Note 5 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Share Repurchase Program

In February 2011, our Board authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0 of our common stock. In August 2011, our Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program up to $450.0 of our common stock. On February 24, 2012, we announced that our Board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0 of our common stock. The new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the program we announced in 2011. We may effect repurchases under the share repurchase programs through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means. We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods, although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and our other funding requirements. The share repurchase programs have no expiration date.

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries. Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. These letters of credit historically have not been drawn upon.

Credit Facilities

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility. In May 2011, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our credit agreement originally dated as of July 18, 2008 (the “Credit Agreement”), increasing the commitments of the lenders to $1,000.0 from $650.0, and extending the Credit Agreement's expiration to May 31, 2016. Additionally, the amendments modified our financial covenants, and provided additional flexibility with respect to, or eliminated, certain covenants such as restrictions on acquisitions, capital expenditures and restricted payments. In addition, the cost structure was reduced. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,000.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $200.0 or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. We have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003, although we use them for letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries.

The Credit Agreement includes covenants that, among other things, limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limit subsidiary debt, as well as financial covenants. The financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require that we maintain, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, certain financial measures for the four quarters then ended. The table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of December 31, 2011.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 EBITDA is calculated as defined in the Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement. If we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver. If we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal. In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility. 

We also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the United States. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately 5.0%.

Capped Call

In November 2010, we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 4.75% Notes are convertible. 

The strike price and cap price related to the capped call options as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2011, the strike price and cap price related to the capped call options were adjusted due to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, the options give us the right to purchase up to 16.5 shares of our common stock at the strike price, except that the economic value of the net proceeds of exercising the options will not exceed the difference between the strike price and the cap price. Subject to certain limitations, we may elect settlement of the options to occur in cash or in shares. The options will expire on April 2, 2013. Our capped call transaction meets the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement per Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).

Investments

From time to time, we make investments in privately held companies that we believe may be of strategic importance to the advertising and marketing sectors. These investments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost. Certain of these investments, the most significant of which is in Facebook, have significantly appreciated compared to their cost, but there can be no assurance as to the terms on which we would be able to dispose of any such investments.

In August 2011, we sold approximately half of our holdings in Facebook and received net proceeds of $133.5, which was classified within the investing section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2011, our remaining holdings in Facebook are recorded at cost on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although we believe the value of our holdings has significantly appreciated, as evidenced by the sales price of the portion of our investment sold in August.

Cash Pooling 

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the amount netted were $1,106.6 and $916.1, respectively.

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 15, 2012 are listed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We are investment-grade rated by both Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings. The most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in June 2011 when Moody's upgraded our rating from Ba2 to Baa3 and changed our outlook from positive to stable. In May 2011 Standard and Poor’s upgraded our credit rating from BB to BB+, and changed our outlook from positive to stable. In October 2010, Fitch Ratings upgraded our rating from BB+ to BBB and changed our outlook from positive to stable. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, including, among other things, because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise. For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid.
