ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Selected Financial Data and TD Groups consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.  

Overview  

We believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers. Some of our more significant product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, NiCad batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, cockpit security components and systems, specialized cockpit displays, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology. Each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer.  

Long-term Sustainable Growth  

For fiscal year 2011, we generated net sales of $1,206.0 million, gross profit of $661.2 million or 54.8% of sales, and net income of $172.1 million. We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term.  

Our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business. The integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business.  

Our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below.  

We believe our key competitive strengths include:  

Large and Growing Installed Product Base with Aftermarket Revenue Stream. We provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. We estimate that our products are installed on approximately 70,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.  

Diversified Revenue Base. We believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. Our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. We expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications.

Significant Barriers to Entry. We believe that the niche nature of our markets, the industrys stringent regulatory and certification requirements, the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors.  

Our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.  

Value-Driven Operating Strategy. Our three core value drivers are:  

       Obtaining Profitable New Business. We attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise, application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. We have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and OEM products to drive our growth.  

       Improving Our Cost Structure. We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.  

       Providing Highly Engineered Value-Added Products to Customers. We focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. We believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. This has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.  

Selective Acquisition Strategy. We selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. We have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. As of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired and integrated 34 businesses and/or product lines since our formation in 1993. Many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing TransDigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume.  

Public Offerings  

On March 20, 2006 and May 25, 2007, certain stockholders of TD Group (including certain members of our management) sold an aggregate of 11.5 million and 12.6 million shares of TD Groups common stock, respectively, in public offerings at prices of $21.00 and $35.25 per share. TD Group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the public offerings and TD Group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders. As a result of the initial public offering, TD Groups common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TDG.  

Certain Acquisitions and Divestitures  

Schneller Holdings Acquisition  

On August 31, 2011, TransDigm Inc. acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Schneller Holdings LLC (Schneller) for approximately $288.5 million in cash, subject to adjustments based on the level of working capital as of the closing date of the acquisition. Schneller designs and manufactures proprietary, highly engineered laminates, thermoplastics, and non-textile flooring for use primarily on side walls, lavatories, galleys, bulkheads and cabin floors for commercial aircraft. These products fit well with TransDigms overall business direction. The Company is in the process of obtaining information to value certain tangible and intangible assets of Schneller, and therefore the consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2011 reflect a preliminary purchase price allocation for the business.

Trend Information  

We predominantly serve customers in the commercial, regional, business jet and general aviation aftermarket, which accounts for approximately 40% of total sales; the commercial aerospace OEM market, comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers, which accounts for approximately 28% of total sales; and the defense market, which accounts for approximately 29% of total sales. Non-aerospace sales comprise approximately 3% of our total sales.  

The commercial aerospace industry, including the aftermarket and OEM market, is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo-political events around the world. The commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles, or RPMs, between 2003 and 2008, as well as increases in OEM production and backlog, however, in 2009, the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing RPMs to decline slightly. This market sector began to rebound in 2010 and continued to grow in 2011 with increases in RPMs, as well as the growth in the large commercial OEM sector (aircraft with 100 or more seats) with order announcements by The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. leading to planned increases in production. The 2012 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest the continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued RPM growth, a modest acceleration of capacity growth and increases in production at the OEM level.  

The defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints, the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts. It is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry.  

Our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk. We service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry, and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft, which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform. At times, declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another. However, due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to OEM and aftermarket customers, variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin.  

There are many short-term factors (including inventory corrections, unannounced changes in order patterns, strikes and mergers and acquisitions) that can cause short-term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years. To normalize for short-term fluctuations, we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short-term periods. As such, it can be difficult to determine longer-term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons.  

There are also fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter-to-quarter, as well as variations in product mix from quarter-to-quarter, that may cause positive or negative variations in  

32  

Table of Contents 

 gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial OEMs. Again, in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators.  

Commercial Aftermarket  

The key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide RPMs and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft. Although RPMs increased annually between 2003 and 2008, 2009 had negative growth as a result of reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy. Worldwide RPMs returned to positive growth in 2010 and 2011 and current industry consensus indicates that RPM growth will continue in 2012.  

Commercial OEM Market  

Conditions in the commercial transport market sector improved during 2011. We are now expecting increased sales in the large commercial OEM sector (aircraft with 100 or more seats) driven by order announcements by The Boeing Company and Airbus S.A.S. Furthermore, the business jet OEM market significantly declined between 2008 and 2010. However, the business jet OEM market has started to recover in 2011 and is expected to continue to show positive growth in 2012. This market has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth, corporate profits, commodity prices and stock market returns across the world.  

Defense  

In recent years, defense spending has reached historic highs, due in part to the military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on terrorism. Our military business fluctuates from year to year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts. We anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could be flat to modestly down in future years over the current high levels.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.  

We have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends. These critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. Our most critical accounting policies are as follows:  

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances: Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. Collectability of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale. Provisions for returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. We have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances; however, due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material.  

33  

Table of Contents 

Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness. The allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. Managements estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and a general amount for estimated credit losses based on historical information. The determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. Depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues, or if the financial condition of any of the Companys customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired, increases in these allowances may be required. Historically, changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant.  

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty period for products sold, which varies among the Companys operations, is typically less than two years but can be in the range from 90 days to six years. In addition, certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions. The Company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and based on excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources. The Company also provides a general amount based on historical trends. To the extent total warranty claims differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established.  

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods for all locations except CEF Industries, LLC, which determines the cost of inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Because the Company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 30 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. Where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. Although management believes that the Companys estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year. Historically, changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant.  

Intangible Assets: Mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Fair value adjustments to the Companys assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition. We generally use third-party appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets.  

Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Companys intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.  

GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the Company. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction, and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary, any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary.  

34  

Table of Contents 

At the time of goodwill impairment testing, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as Company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.  

Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. As an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting units estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company.  

The Company had 17 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the date of the last annual impairment test. The estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values (by more than 15 percent), and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values. With a one percentage point increase in the discount rate, the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values.  

Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. Management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.  

The discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.  

Stock Options: The Company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the estimated fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the vesting periods of the options. The Company estimates the fair value of all share-based payments using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires management to make certain assumptions. Management continuously reviews the  

35  

Table of Contents 

 following assumptions: risk-free interest rates, expected life of options, expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside managements control could have an impact on the Companys results of operations.  

Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites and at third-party sites. The Company accrues for environmental-related activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. All accrued amounts were recorded on an undiscounted basis. Environmental-related expenses include costs of investigation and remediation and fees paid to outside engineering, actuarial, consulting and law firms. Due to uncertainties surrounding environmental investigations and remediation activities, the Companys ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued.  

Income Taxes: The Company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. Historically, such adjustments have not been significant.  

Results of Operations  

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010  

Net Sales. Net sales increased by $378.4 million, or 45.7%, to $1,206.0 million for fiscal 2011 from $827.7 million for fiscal 2010. Sales of $276.2 million, or 33.4%, resulted from the acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace and Semco Instruments in fiscal 2010 and McKechnie Aerospace, Talley Actuation and Schneller Holdings in fiscal 2011. Organic sales increased by $102.2 million or 12.3% from the prior year.  

The organic sales growth was primarily due to an increase of $22.2 million, or a 12.0% increase in commercial OEM sales, and an increase of $73.7 million, or a 22.1% increase in commercial aftermarket sales, resulting primarily from improving market demand for commercial aftermarket products. Defense sales increased by $1.6 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.  

36  

Table of Contents 

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit. Cost of sales increased by $190.2 million, or 53.7%, to $544.8 million for fiscal 2011 from $354.6 million for fiscal 2010. The increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the net sales from acquisitions and the organic sales growth discussed above, along with an increase in inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs.  

Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 54.8% for fiscal 2011 from 57.2% for fiscal 2010. The dollar amount of gross profit increased by $188.1 million, or 39.8%, to $661.2 million for fiscal 2011 from $473.1 million for fiscal 2010. The increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items:  

       Sales of $276.2 million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately $110 million for fiscal 2011, which includes the acquisition-related costs (inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs) incurred in connection with those acquisitions amounting to $26.2 million. These acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 by approximately 4 percentage points.  

       Organic sales growth described above, favorable product mix and favorable product pricing on our proprietary products resulted in increased gross profit of approximately $78 million for fiscal 2011.  

Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased by $38.8 million to $133.7 million, or 11.1% of sales, for fiscal 2011 from $94.9 million, or 11.5% of sales, for the fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately $28 million and non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $5 million.  

Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased to $40.3 million for fiscal 2011 from $15.1 million for fiscal 2010. The net increase of $25.2 million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months.  

Refinancing Costs. Refinancing costs were recorded as a result of the refinancing of TransDigms entire debt structure in December 2010. The charge of $72.5 million consisted of the premium of $41.9 million paid to redeem our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes, the write-off of debt issue costs and unamortized note premium and discount of $25.7 million, and the settlement of the interest rate swap agreement and other expenses of $4.9 million.  

Interest Expense-net. Interest expense increased $73.0 million, or 65.1%, to $185.3 million for fiscal 2011 from $112.2 million for fiscal 2010. The net increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings, which was approximately $2.90 billion for fiscal 2011 and approximately $1.78 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in borrowings was due to the debt refinancing transactions and the acquisition financing related to McKechnie Aerospace which occurred in December 2010. The weighted average interest rate on total borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2011 was approximately 5.9%.  

Income Taxes. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 33.6% for fiscal 2011 compared to 34.8% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to non-recurring adjustments in estimated deferred state obligations and an increase in research and development tax credits.  

Income from Discontinued Operations. Income from discontinued operations comprises the net loss from discontinued operations through the dates of sale of the fastener business and AQS of $2.1 million and the after-tax net gain on sales of $22.0 million recorded during fiscal 2011.  

Net Income. Net income increased $8.7 million, or 5.3%, to $172.1 million for fiscal 2011 compared to net income of $163.4 million for fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of the factors referred to above.

Earnings per Share. The basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.17 for fiscal 2011 and $2.52 per share for fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.80 and basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.37. Net income for fiscal 2011 of $172.1 million was decreased by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of $2.8 million resulting in net income available to shareholders of $169.3 million. Due to the special cash dividend declared and paid during fiscal 2010, the net income for fiscal 2010 of $163.4 million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of $30.3 million resulting in net income applicable to common shareholders of $133.1 million.  

Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009  

Net Sales. Net sales increased by $66.1 million, or 8.7%, to $827.7 million for fiscal 2010 from $761.5 million for fiscal 2009. Sales of $73.8 million resulted from the acquisitions of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and the Woodward HRT product line in fiscal 2009 as well as the recent acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace and Semco in fiscal 2010.  

Sales excluding acquisitions declined by $7.6 million, or 1.0%, from the prior year. The decline in organic sales was primarily due to a decrease of $18.7 million, or a 9.9% decrease in commercial OEM sales resulting primarily from the business jet OEMs significant production rate reductions and related inventory reductions resulting from the impact of the global economic conditions. Partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial OEM sales was (i) an increase of $6.2 million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic; and (ii) an increase of $2.7 million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for OEM products across most of our product lines.  

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit. Cost of sales increased by $22.4 million, or 6.7%, to $354.6 million for fiscal 2010 from $332.2 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales discussed above. In addition, the increase was partially attributable to higher costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into TD Groups operations and purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to cost of sales of $3.3 million.  

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 57.2% for fiscal 2010 from 56.4% for fiscal 2009. The dollar amount of gross profit increased by $43.7 million, or 10.2%, to $473.1 million for fiscal year 2010 from $429.3 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items:  

       Sales of $73.8 million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately $26 million in fiscal 2010, which includes the acquisition-related costs (inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs) incurred in connection with those acquisitions amounting to $9.0 million. These acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 by approximately 2 percentage points.  

       Favorable product mix, favorable product pricing on our proprietary products and cost reduction efforts partially offset by the negative impact of fixed overhead costs spread over lower production volume (excluding acquisitions). The net impact of these items resulted in increased gross profit of approximately $18 million in fiscal 2010 despite the decline in organic sales of $7.6 million discussed above.  

Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased by $14.9 million or 18.6%, to $94.9 million, 11.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2010 from $80.0 million, or 10.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately $6.4 million, transaction-related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Dukes Aerospace and Semco Instruments of approximately $2.7 million, higher research and development expenses primarily relating to Airbus A350 and A380 platforms more than offsetting declines in expenses on the Boeing 787, new business development expenses and higher professional fees.

Table of Contents 

Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased to $15.1 million for fiscal 2010 from $13.9 million for fiscal 2009. The net increase of $1.2 million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months partially offset by the order backlog becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2009 relating to prior acquisitions.  

Income from Operations. Operating income increased by $27.7 million, or 8.2%, to $363.1 million for fiscal 2010 from $335.4 million for fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above.  

Interest Expense-Net. Interest expense-net increased $27.8 million, or 33.0%, to $112.2 million for fiscal 2010 from $84.4 million for fiscal 2009, comprising an increase in interest expense of $26.7 million and a decrease in interest income of $1.1 million. Interest expense increased primarily due to interest expense of approximately $37.3 million attributable to the $425 million of 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2014 issued in October 2009. Partially offsetting the increase was lower interest rates on the Companys existing floating-rate borrowings under its senior secured credit facility. The Companys weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately $1.78 billion for fiscal 2010 and approximately $1.36 billion for fiscal 2009. The average interest rate on total debt was approximately 6.0% for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Interest income was lower primarily due to lower interest rates on our invested cash balances.  

Income Taxes. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 34.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.1% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reductions in estimated state tax obligations.  

Net Income. Net income increased $0.5 million, or 0.3%, to $163.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $162.9 million for fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of the factors referred to above.  

Earnings per Share. The basic and diluted earnings per share, calculated under the two-class method, was $2.52 per share for fiscal 2010 and $3.10 per share for fiscal 2009. Due to the special cash dividend declared and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the net income for fiscal 2010 of $163.4 million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of $30.3 million (approximately $0.57 per share) resulting in a net income applicable to common stockholders of $133.1 million.  

Backlog  

As of September 30, 2011, the Company estimated its sales order backlog at $737 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of $467 million as of September 30, 2010. The increase in backlog is primarily due to the acquisitions of McKechnie Aerospace, Talley Actuation and Schneller Holdings discussed above, totaling approximately $207 million. The majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2011 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months. Purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment. The level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the Companys receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, the Companys backlog as of September 30, 2011 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period.  

Foreign Operations  

Although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the United States, we manufacture some products in Belgium, Malaysia and Mexico. We sell our products in the United States, as well as in foreign countries. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including currency fluctuations, difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations, general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate, limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, change in trade policies, tariff regulation, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition.

Table of Contents 

Our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $305.5 million, $170.6 million, and $150.4 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the Company within such governments countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.  

Inflation  

Many of the Companys raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. The effects of inflation on the Companys businesses during the fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not significant.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt.  

We continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business. The Company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage, taking into consideration the Companys debt holders, equity holders, credit ratings, acquisition opportunities and other factors. The Companys debt leverage ratio, which is computed as total debt divided by EBITDA As Defined for the applicable twelve-month period, has varied widely during the Companys history, ranging from approximately 3.5 to 6.5. Our debt leverage ratio for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 was approximately 5.3.  

The Company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition. The Companys acquisition strategy may require substantial capital, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions, total interest expense will increase.  

If the Company has excess cash, it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend, prepayment of indebtedness, repurchase of stock, repurchase of debt or other means. Whether the Company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Companys liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, the Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so.  

The Companys ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Companys indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the Companys ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control. Based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events, management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations, non-acquisition related capital expenditures, research and development efforts and long-term indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2012. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the Company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other  

40  

Table of Contents 

 liquidity needs. The Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity. Also, to the extent the Company accelerates its growth plans, consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses, the Company may also need to raise additional capital. In particular, increased working capital needs occur whenever the Company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  

The Company has not, at this time, determined to change the nature of its debt facilities. However, in the future, the Company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.  

Operating Activities. The Company generated $260.6 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2011 compared to $197.3 million during fiscal 2010. The net increase of $63.3 million was due primarily due to an increase in income from operations offset by higher interest payments and associated refinancing costs in connection with the Companys debt refinancing transactions during fiscal 2011.  

The Company generated $197.3 million of cash from operating activities on net income of $163.4 million during fiscal 2010 compared to $197.1 million of cash from operating activities generated on net income of $162.9 million during fiscal 2009. 

Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $1,397.0 million during fiscal 2011, consisting primarily of the acquisitions of McKechnie Aerospace, Talley Actuation and Schneller Holdings for a total of $1,650.4 million and capital expenditures of $18.0 million offset by the cash proceeds on the sale of the fastener business and AQS of $271.4 million.  

Net cash used in investing activities was $176.6 million during fiscal 2010 consisting primarily of the acquisitions of Dukes Aerospace and Semco for a total of $166.6 million and capital expenditures of $12.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 also includes cash proceeds of $2.9 million from the sale of real estate no longer utilized.  

Net cash used in investing activities was $168.4 million during fiscal 2009 consisting primarily of the acquisitions of the businesses of Aircraft Parts Corporation, Acme and Woodward HRT product line for a total of $155.2 million and capital expenditures of $13.2 million.  

Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2011 was $1,278.5 million, which comprised $1,260.3 million of net proceeds from the refinancing of our entire debt structure, $11.6 million repayment on our New Senior Secured Credit Facility, $2.8 million of dividends and dividend equivalent payments, and $32.6 million of cash for tax benefits related to share-based payment arrangements and from the exercise of stock options.  

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2010 was $23.2 million, which comprised $404.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 7  3/4% senior subordinated notes in October 2009, $404.9 million of dividends and dividend equivalent payments, and $23.8 million of cash for tax benefits related to share-based payment arrangements and from the exercise of stock options.  

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 was $2.4 million related to the exercise of stock options of $17.6 million partially offset by purchases of treasury stock amounting to $15.2 million.  

Description of New Senior Secured Credit Facility and Indentures  

In December 2010, TransDigm entered into a senior secured credit facility, which consisted of a $1.55 billion term loan facility and a $245 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the Existing Senior Secured  

41  

Table of Contents 

 Credit Facility). The proceeds of the term loan were used to pay the purchase price of and related transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of McKechnie Aerospace and repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the previous senior secured credit facility.  

On February 14, 2011, TransDigm Inc. entered into a new senior secured credit facility which provides for $1.55 billion term loan facility (the New Senior Secured Credit Facility), which was fully drawn on February 14, 2011. The New Senior Secured Credit Facility replaced the term loan under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility and modified certain terms of the original agreement including extending the maturity date of the term loan and modifying the interest rate provisions.  

On March 25, 2011, TransDigm entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment) to the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Amendment provides for a modification to certain terms of the permitted indebtedness covenant contained in the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility to modify the requirements for incurring certain additional senior indebtedness.  

Under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility, the revolving credit facility matures in December 2015. At September 30, 2011, the Company had $8.0 million letters of credit outstanding and $237.0 of borrowings available under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility.  

Under the New Senior Secured Credit Facility, the term loan matures in February 2017. The term loan under the New Senior Secured Credit Facility requires quarterly principal payments that began on March 31, 2011.  

The interest rates per annum applicable to the term loan under the New Senior Secured Credit Facility will be, at TransDigms option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent agreed to by each relevant lender, nine or twelve-month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The applicable interest rate on the term loan at September 30, 2011 was 4.0%.  

On June 27, 2011, the Company entered into three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements beginning December 31, 2012 to hedge the variable interest rates on the New Senior Secured Credit Facility for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $353 million through June 30, 2015. These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements will effectively convert the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the New Senior Secured Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 5.17% over the term of the interest rate swap agreements.  

All of the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facilities is guaranteed by TD Group and all of TransDigms current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than immaterial subsidiaries), and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future property and assets, including inventory, equipment, general intangibles, intellectual property, investment property and other personal property (but excluding leasehold interests and certain other assets) of TransDigm and all of TransDigms existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than immaterial subsidiaries), and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of TransDigm and its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of TransDigms foreign subsidiaries.  

The credit facilities contain certain covenants that limit the ability of TD Group, TransDigm and TransDigms restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt, make investments, sell assets, enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries to TransDigm, incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness, consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets, and engage in transactions with affiliates. At September 30, 2011, TransDigm was in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities.  

42  

Table of Contents 

The term loan under the New Senior Secured Credit Facility requires mandatory prepayments of principal based on certain percentages of Excess Cash Flow (as therein defined), commencing 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions (including, with respect to asset sales, the reinvestment in productive assets), TransDigm will be required to prepay the loans outstanding under the term loan facility at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and issuance or incurrence of certain indebtedness. In addition, if, prior to February 14, 2012, the principal amount of the term loans are (i) prepaid substantially concurrently with the incurrence by TD Group, TransDigm or any its subsidiaries of new bank loans that have an effective yield lower than the yield in effect on the term loans so prepaid or (ii) received by a lender due to a mandatory assignment following the failure of such lender to consent to an amendment of the New Senior Secured Credit Facility that has the effect of reducing the effective interest rate with respect to the term loans, such prepayment or receipt shall be accompanied by a premium of 1.0%.  

In December 2010, TransDigm issued $1.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) at an issue price of 100% of the principal amount. The 2018 Notes represent unsecured obligations of TransDigm Inc. ranking subordinate to TransDigm Inc.s senior debt, as defined in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes (the Indenture). Such notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in December 2018. Interest under the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually.  

TransDigm utilized a portion of the proceeds from the 2018 Notes to repurchase its 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014.  

Certain Restrictive Covenants in Our Debt Documents  

The credit facilities and the Indenture contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of other indebtedness. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the credit facilities or the Indenture. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the credit facilities and the holders of the 2018 Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the credit facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the credit facilities, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 2018 Notes.  

Stock Repurchase Program  

On August 22, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program, which was announced on August 23, 2011. Under the terms of the program, the Company may purchase up to a maximum aggregate value of $100 million of its shares of common stock. At September 30, 2011, no shares were repurchased under this program. The program replaces the repurchase program announced on October 23, 2008, under which the Company previously repurchased 494,100 share of its common stock at a gross cost of approximately $15.2 million at a weighted-average price per share of $30.85. No purchases were made under the program during the year.

Contractual Obligations  

The following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2011 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) The new senior secured credit facility will mature in February 2017 and requires quarterly principal payments of $3.9 million.  

 (2) Assumes that the variable interest rate on our borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility remains constant at 4.0%. In addition, interest payments include the impact of the 5.17% interest rate fixed through our forward-starting swap agreements from December 31, 2012 through June 30, 2015 on an aggregate notional amount of $353 million.  

In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, the Company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and, from time to time, for facility expansion. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $18.0 million, $12.9 million, and $13.2 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and fiscal 2009, respectively. The Company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 to be between $25 million and $30 million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter.  

New Accounting Standards  

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued authoritative accounting guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. This guidance amends the requirements for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements and is effective for the Company during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Upon adoption, the Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.  

In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative accounting guidance included in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. This guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. The Company is currently evaluating which method it will utilize to present items of net income and other comprehensive income. This presentation guidance is effective for the Company on October 1, 2012.  

In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative accounting guidance included in ASC Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. This guidance amends the requirements for goodwill impairment testing. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. This guidance is effective for the Company for its annual goodwill impairment testing for the year ending September 30, 2013.
