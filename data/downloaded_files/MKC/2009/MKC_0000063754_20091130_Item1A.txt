Item 1A. Risk Factors  

The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our Common Stock or Common Stock Non-Voting, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  

Damage to Our Reputation or Brand Name, Loss of Brand Relevance or Increase in Private Label Use by Customers or Consumers Could Negatively Impact Us.  

Our reputation for manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard that reputation, we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law. We also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brand through effective marketing and other measures. A serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or consumer relationships, or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brand, which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, our customers evaluate their mix of branded and private label product offerings. If a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label, it could have a significant impact on our consumer business.  

The Consolidation of Customers May Put Pressures on Our Operating Margins and Profitability.  

Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the U.S., the European Union, and other major markets. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, resisting price increases, demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products, and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability.

Issues Regarding Procurement of Raw Materials May Negatively Impact Us.  

Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. The most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products, pepper, wheat, onion, capsicums, soybean oil, and garlic. While future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, and customer price adjustments. We have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. Any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.  

In addition, we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, political unrest in the producing countries, changes in governmental agricultural programs, and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results.  

Further, political, socio-economic, and cultural conditions, as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities, in developing countries create risks for food safety. Although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products, we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.  

Our Profitability May Suffer as a Result of Competition in Our Markets.  

The food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in our product categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases.  

Our Operations may be Impaired as a Result of Disasters, Business Interruptions or Similar Events.  

A natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or severe storm, or a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack, an epidemic affecting our operating activities, major facilities, or employees and customers health, or a computer system failure, could cause an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory and/or data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner.  

6  

We cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that an earthquake, natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be seriously harmed.  

We May Not Be Able to Successfully Consummate Proposed Acquisitions or Divestitures or Integrate Acquired Businesses.  

From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These potential acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected.  

Our Foreign Operations are Subject to Additional Risks.  

We operate our business and market our products internationally. In fiscal year 2009, 38% of our sales were generated in foreign countries. Our foreign operations are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and other economic or political uncertainties. Additionally, international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could adversely affect our profitability.  

Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Markets May Negatively Impact Us.  

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Primary exposures include the British pound sterling versus the Euro, and the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, and Thai baht. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks. However, these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.

Increases in Interest Rates May Negatively Impact Us.  

We had total outstanding short-term borrowings of approximately $101.2 million at an average interest rate of approximately 0.4% on November 30, 2009. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. Our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.  

The Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets May Adversely Affect our Access to Sources of Funding.  

We rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements. The Company engages in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities. During these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, management periodically reviews our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services, and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, management believes the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote.  

In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. Our inability to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  

We Face Risks Associated With Certain Pension Assets and Obligations.  

We hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our U.S. non-qualified pension plan. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise, could cause (or increase) an  

8  

 underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

The Global Financial Downturn Exposes Us to Credit Risks from Customers and Counterparties.  

Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are volatile, and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
