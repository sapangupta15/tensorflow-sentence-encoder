Both of these businesses have several strong competitors. In the process and analytical instruments market, numerous companies in each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. The aerospace and power instrument businesses have a number of diversified competitors, which vary depending on the specific market niche.  

 EMGs differentiated businesses have competition from a limited number of companies in each of their markets. Competition is generally based on product innovation, performance and price. There also is competition from alternative materials and processes. In its cost-driven businesses, EMG has limited domestic competition in the U.S. floor care market from independent manufacturers. Competition is increasing from Asian motor manufacturers that serve both the U.S. and the European floor care markets. Increasingly, global vacuum motor production is being shifted to Asia where AMETEK has a smaller but growing market position. There is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motor-blowers. Many of these manufacturers would also be potential EMG customers if they decided to outsource their motor production.  

 Backlog and Seasonal Variations of Business  

 The Companys backlog of unfilled orders by business segment was as follows at December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The lower backlog at December 31, 2009 was primarily due to the global economic recession, partially offset by the acquisition of High Standard Aviation and Ameron Global in 2009 and the positive impact of a weakening U.S. dollar when compared to the British pound and Euro.   

 9   
 Of the total backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2009, approximately 82% is expected to be shipped by December 31, 2010. The Company believes that neither its business as a whole, nor either of its reportable segments, is subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain individual operations experience some seasonal variability.  

 Availability of Raw Materials  

 The Companys reportable segments obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than one supplier. However, for EMG, certain items, including various base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes its sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs.  

 Research, Product Development and Engineering  

 The Company is committed to research, product development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, product development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $101.4 million, $115.9 million and $102.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $5.5 million, $6.1 million and $7.1 million, respectively.
