ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

 Those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 53 and Risk Factors on page 17 for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.   

 BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OVERVIEW   

 Industry Overview  

 Our profitability is substantially determined by the difference between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, which is referred to below as refined product margins. Beginning in the second half of 2007 and continuing through the first half of 2008, crude oil prices climbed rapidly until peaking at a record high in early July 2008 while product prices increased more gradually than crude oil prices resulting in a weak margin environment. For example, from July 2007 through June 2008 the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased by  

 approximately 97%, while the average spot price for gasoline on the U.S. West Coast rose only 58%. The rapid increase in crude oil prices was attributed in part to such factors as continued global demand growth, concerns over declining crude oil supplies and increasing investments in crude oil to hedge against the weakening U.S. dollar. Gasoline prices increased less dramatically than crude oil prices during the period due to falling domestic demand and high product inventories.

 After crude oil prices peaked in early July 2008, recessionary concerns, declining global demand and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a sharp decline in crude oil prices through the end of the year. Gasoline prices declined with falling crude oil prices due to declining demand, however, lower industry production and the impacts of hurricanes Gustav and Ike in September 2008 strengthened gasoline margins in September and October. Gasoline margins declined through the remainder of the year with the exception of margins on the U.S. West Coast. Beginning in mid-December both planned and unplanned refinery outages combined with historically low gasoline inventories to benefit margins. Despite the overall decline in gasoline margins in 2008 as compared to 2007, diesel fuel margins were higher than 2007 levels due to continued strong global demand and low inventories.  

 Strategy and Goals  

 Our strategy is to create a value-added refining and marketing business that has (i) economies of scale, (ii) a competitive cost structure, (iii) effective management information systems that enable success and (iv) outstanding employees focused on achieving operational excellence in a global market in order to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment.  

 28   
 We focus our goals on: (i) operating our facilities in a safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible way; (ii) improving cash flow by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies; and (iii) using excess cash flows from operations to create further shareholder value.  

 We previously announced that our value creation strategy would focus on pursuing internal yield and cost benefits rather than external acquisitions. This change in our strategy was timely as the industry has recently experienced declining refining margins. We developed initiatives in late 2007 to improve profitability at our Los Angeles and Hawaii refineries and developed initiatives at our other refineries in 2008 in response to a lower refining margin environment. These and other company-wide initiatives are designed to minimize borrowings on our revolving credit facility and fund capital expenditures solely from operating cash flow. We funded our 2008 capital program through operating cash flow and minimized borrowings by accomplishing the following initiatives during 2008:  

       Optimized inventories to better match lower demand resulting in an inventory reduction of approximately 5 million barrels from the end of 2007;   

       Reduced capital expenditures to $619 million from our original capital budget of $966 million. Most projects impacted by this reduction have been delayed or adjusted in scope rather than canceled; and   

       Improved capture of available margins (our ability to realize a higher percentage of industry margins) by (i) refining lower cost crude oils as a result of operating the delayed coker at the Golden Eagle refinery beginning in the second quarter; (ii) refining a greater percentage of lower cost, waterborne crude oils at the Los Angeles refinery; (iii) optimizing our diesel fuel and gasoline production to respond to market demand; (iv) adjusting our run rates and feedstock mix to respond to current market conditions particularly at our Washington refinery; and (v) implementing initiatives at our Hawaii refinery primarily focused on processing lower cost crude oils and improving reliability.    

 In 2009, our goals are to continue to gain sustainable improvements in our capture of available margins, lower break-even costs and fund our capital program through operating cash flow. Plans to improve our capture of available margins in 2009 include (i) lowering crude costs through benefits of our prior years capital programs, (ii) further capitalizing on shipping economies of scale, (iii) increasing crude flexibility, (iv) continuing to match production to demand and (v) optimizing diesel fuel and gasoline production. We plan to reduce operating expenses through energy efficiency and maintenance efficiency programs.  

 Golden Eagle Coker Modification Project  

 The delayed coker at our Golden Eagle refinery became fully operational during the 2008 second quarter. Spending since inception totaled $602 million. The modification of our fluid coker unit to a delayed coker enabled us to comply with the terms of an abatement order to lower air emissions while also enhancing the refinerys capabilities in terms of crude oil flexibility, reliability, lengthening turnaround cycles and lowering maintenance costs. The project will significantly reduce the duration and costs of coker turnarounds as well as increase the coker turnaround cycle from 2.5 years to 5 years. In addition, we expect the modified coker to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the refinery.  

 Selective Hydrogenation Unit  

 The selective hydrogenation unit (SHU) at our Washington refinery was fully operational during the 2008 fourth quarter and reduces the sulfur content in gasoline. The SHU allows a higher percentage of sour crude oils to be processed at the refinery while maintaining compliance with gasoline sulfur regulations.  

 Future Strategic Capital Projects  

 We have identified short-term, high return projects that focus on lowering our feedstock costs, improving clean product yields and reducing operating costs, including improving energy efficiency at all of our refineries. These projects, which are currently under evaluation, are not included in our 2009 capital budget. However, certain of these projects may be implemented in 2009 or thereafter as we have cash flow available from operations. Additionally, our long-term capital plans include larger projects to further reduce feedstock costs at our Golden  

 29   
 Eagle, Los Angeles and Hawaii refineries. All of these projects are preliminary and subject to further review and analysis.  

  Hedging Program  

 We periodically enter into non-trading derivative arrangements primarily to manage price risks associated with the purchase and/or sale of 1) crude oil and 2) finished products involving inventories above our target levels. These derivative arrangements typically involve exchange-traded futures and over-the-counter swaps, generally with durations of one year or less. Historically, we hedged less than 20% of our crude oil and products operating volumes. The crude oil hedges have primarily covered price risks of foreign crude oils supplied to our Hawaii and Golden Eagle refineries. A smaller percentage of the hedges covered West Coast intermediate and finished products. During the 2008 second quarter, we closed the majority of our crude oil derivative positions associated with our long-haul strategy that matched the price of long-haul crude oils to day-of-processing product margin. These closed positions did not have a further significant impact on earnings. The impact of the rapidly rising crude oil prices in the first six months of 2008 on our derivative positions was a pretax loss of $206 million. During the second half of 2008, declining crude oil prices resulted in a pretax gain of $100 million. Net earnings for the year included a pretax loss of $106 million on our derivative positions.  

 Hawaii Refinery Initiatives  

 We implemented several initiatives to improve profitability at our Hawaii refinery in response to falling gross refining margins during 2007 and the first half of 2008. One key initiative was to reduce our reliance on light sweet crude oil from Asia to achieve crude oil cost savings. Starting in the 2008 first quarter, we began to run more cost advantaged heavy sweet and light sour crude oils reducing our light sweet crude oils as a percent of total throughput to 20% from 37% a year ago. We also increased our percentage of heavy crude oil to total throughput from 19% in 2007 to 30% in 2008. Another initiative was completed in March 2008 when we improved reliability through the completion of a new electrical substation. We also completed a controls modernization project during the 2008 fourth quarter which is designed to improve reliability and refining yields and reduce energy costs.  

 Los Angeles Refinery Initiatives  

 Since acquiring the Los Angeles refinery in May 2007, we achieved our annual synergy goal of $100 million during the 2008 second quarter mainly through shared crude oil cargo benefits and other feedstock activities. We expect to realize annual recurring synergies of approximately $100 million through our crude oil purchasing and shipping logistics as well as by maximizing the production of clean fuels for the California market.  

 Our initiatives to improve profitability at our Los Angeles refinery in 2008 included optimizing our crude oil supply, increasing distillate production and reducing operating expenses. During the 2008 second quarter, we opted not to renew the remaining crude oil contracts assumed in the acquisition, which allows us to process more cost advantaged foreign crude oils. Beginning in June 2008, we also increased distillate production by approximately 9,000 barrels per day versus the last half of 2007 to take advantage of the strong distillate margins.  

 Recent Developments  

 As widely reported, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in prices of securities, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. These conditions, including severely restricted new credit availability, have not impaired our ability to finance our operations, but there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies that could negatively impact us.  

 The global financial crisis and economic recessions in the U.S. and abroad may also negatively impact our customers and the demand for refined products. For example, an extension of the credit crisis to our customers could adversely impact their ability to maintain liquidity. We are monitoring our customers liquidity in order to mitigate any adverse impact on our results of operations.  

 30   
 American International Group (AIG) is the lead underwriter for many of our coverages, but actually underwrites less than one-fourth of our aggregate coverage. The majority of our insurance coverage is underwritten by insurers other than AIG and its subsidiaries. AIGs exposure to subprime mortgage securities and recent disruptions in the U.S. financial markets have adversely impacted AIG. AIGs commercial insurance subsidiary had funds in excess of loss reserves and continued to be a fully accepted insurance carrier for major brokers at December 31, 2008. However, continued volatility in the U.S. financial markets and the financial condition of AIG may adversely impact the financial strength of AIGs commercial insurance subsidiaries.  

 In October 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (Lehman CPI) filed for bankruptcy. Lehman CPI was a previous lender under our credit agreement, with a commitment of $50 million (less than 3% of our total credit agreement capacity). Lehman CPI will not participate in any future requests for funding and it is not certain whether another lender will assume its commitment. While the financial crisis could impact our ability to obtain future borrowings under our credit agreement if other lenders are unable to perform their obligations, we are unaware of any reason to believe this will happen.   

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

 A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented hereafter. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. Our results include the operations of our Los Angeles refinery and Shell and USA Gasoline retail stations since acquisition in May 2007.  

 Summary  

 Our net earnings for 2008 declined to $278 million ($2.00 per diluted share) from $566 million ($4.06 per diluted share) in 2007. The decline was due primarily to the following:  

       substantially lower industry gasoline margins, particularly during the first half of 2008 versus the first half of 2007;   

       lower gross refining margins at both our Washington and Golden Eagle refineries reflecting planned turnarounds of several units during the first and second quarters;   

       higher operating expenses primarily reflecting increased utility expenses;   

       a $91 million pre-tax charge to write-off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely; and    

  the impact of rising crude oil prices on our derivative positions during the first half of 2008.  

 The decrease in net earnings during 2008 relative to 2007 was partially offset by the following:

 31   
 Net earnings for 2007 declined to $566 million ($4.06 per diluted share) from $801 million ($5.73 per diluted share) in 2006. The decline was due primarily to the following:  

       substantially lower industry refined product margins on the U.S. West Coast during the second half of the year as crude oil prices rose rapidly and product prices increased more gradually;   

       significantly lower gross refining margins at our Hawaii refinery;   

       higher operating expenses reflecting increased repairs and maintenance expenses and employee costs;   

       the impact of rising crude oil prices on our non-trading derivative positions; and   

       increased selling, general and administrative expenses reflecting higher stock-based compensation and employee costs.

Throughput and yield averaged over the 235 days of operation in 2007 were 106 Mbpd and 114 Mbpd, respectively.  

  (c)    We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 24 degrees or less. Amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation.  

  (d)    Management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution.    

 33   
     Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations. Manufacturing costs per barrel is calculated by dividing manufacturing costs by total refining throughput and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  

  (e)    In 2008, we reclassified certain environmental expenses from manufacturing expenses to other operating expenses. We have reclassified expenses of $22 million and $5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, to conform to the 2008 presentation.  

  (f)    Consolidated gross refining margin totals gross refining margin for each of our regions adjusted for other costs not directly attributable to a specific region. Other costs resulted in an increase of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and an increase of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput times gross refining margin per barrel.  

  (g)    Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.40, $1.37 and $1.06 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

  (h)    Sources of total refined product sales included refined products manufactured at the refineries and refined products purchased from third parties. Total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products.  

  (i)    We experienced reduced throughput during scheduled turnarounds for the following refineries: the Golden Eagle and Washington refineries during 2008; the Los Angeles, Golden Eagle, and Utah refineries during 2007; and the Golden Eagle, Washington and Alaska refineries during 2006.   

 2008 Compared to 2007  

 Overview. The decrease in operating income of $561 million during 2008 was primarily due to lower gross refining margins and increased operating expenses primarily due to higher utility costs. In addition, the 2008 fourth quarter included a $91 million charge to write-off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by a decrease to costs of sales of $138 million during 2008 resulting from the liquidation of last-in first-out (LIFO) inventory quantities acquired at lower per-barrel costs. Our gross refining margin per barrel decreased by 10% in 2008 to $11.50 per barrel as compared to $12.73 per barrel in 2007 reflecting significantly lower industry margins for gasoline. U.S. West Coast benchmark gasoline margins were down from an average of $24 per barrel in 2007 to an average of $12 per barrel in 2008 as a result of rapidly rising crude oil prices during the first half of 2008 and weakening product demand. During the second half of 2008, however, crude oil prices declined primarily due to declining global crude oil demand. The rapid decline in crude oil prices resulted in slightly improved refining margins during the last six months of 2008 versus the prior year as product prices declined more gradually. Weaker industry gasoline margins were partially offset by higher diesel fuel margins in 2008 reflecting strong global demand and low inventories. Industry market fundamentals are further described above in Industry Overview. Industry margins were higher in 2007 due to robust market fundamentals during the first half of the year, including strong demand for refined products, low refinery utilization, low products inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non-road diesel fuel which began in June 2007.  

 Gross Refining Margins. Our total gross refining margins declined to $2.5 billion in 2008 from $2.8 billion in 2007, reflecting lower gross refining margins per-barrel in all of our regions except for our Mid-Pacific region. Each of our regions was impacted by lower industry gasoline margins and other regional factors described below.  

       In our California region, gross refining margins decreased 14% to $14.08 per barrel in 2008 as compared to 2007. Although gross refining margins declined on a per-barrel basis, our total gross refining margins increased year-over-year as a result of operating the Los Angeles refinery for a full year in 2008. Our gross refining margins were negatively impacted during 2008 by the turnaround of five major units at our Golden    

 34   
      Eagle refinery from mid-March through April. We estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by approximately $97 million as a result of this turnaround. In addition, our ability to capture the cost differentials between foreign sourced and local crude oils at our Los Angeles refinery through the first half of 2008 was limited by certain contractual purchase commitments and refinery logistical limitations. In the 2008 second quarter, we opted not to renew the remaining crude oil contracts assumed in the acquisition which has allowed us to process more cost advantaged foreign crude oils. The decrease in gross refining margins was partially offset as we increased runs of more cost advantaged crude oil in connection with the operation of the delayed coker at the Golden Eagle refinery beginning in the 2008 second quarter. Our gross refining margins in 2007 were negatively impacted at our Golden Eagle refinery due to scheduled turnarounds of the fluid catalytic cracker and hydrocracking units and other unscheduled downtime.    

       Gross refining margins in our Pacific Northwest region decreased 38% to $6.82 per barrel in 2008 as compared to 2007. Gasoline industry margins in the region declined by almost 60% from 2007 reflecting poor demand. Our gross refining margins were also negatively impacted in 2008 due to the turnaround of our fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation units at our Washington refinery from late January to mid-February. Unplanned boiler outages at the Washington refinery in December also negatively impacted gross refining margins. During the 2007 first quarter, we experienced scheduled and unscheduled downtime at our Washington refinery. During the first half of 2007, heavy industry turnaround activity and unscheduled downtime on the U.S. West Coast benefited our gross refining margins in the region.   

       In our Mid-Pacific region, gross refining margins increased to $6.72 per barrel from $1.18 per barrel in 2007. The increase in our gross refining margins in the region reflects our ability to run more cost advantaged heavy sweet and light sour crude oils in 2008 as part of our Hawaii improvement initiatives previously discussed. Starting in the 2008 first quarter, we began to run more cost advantaged heavy sweet and light sour crude oils reducing our light sweet crude oils as a percent of total throughput to 20% from 37% a year ago. We also increased our percentage of heavy crude oil to total throughput from 19% in 2007 to 30% in 2008. In addition, several of our term refined product contracts have lagging pricing provisions (based on prior months prices), which benefited our gross refinery margins in the second half of 2008 as crude oil prices declined. Gross refining margins were further benefited by our completion of a controls modernization project in the 2008 fourth quarter which improves reliability and refining yields and reduces energy costs. We also completed a new electrical substation during the 2008 first quarter resulting in improved reliability.   

       In our Mid-Continent region, gross refining margins decreased 14% to $15.12 per barrel in 2008 as compared to 2007. Our gross refining margins in the region were negatively impacted by the scheduled downtime of three units for mechanical repairs at our Utah refinery during the 2008 third quarter. Further, poor weather during the 2008 first quarter reduced our crude oil supplies to the Utah refinery and dampened regional product demand. Conversely, strong product demand from the farming sector and unplanned outages at several refineries in the region during the first half of 2007 benefited industry margins in the prior year. The decrease in our gross refining margins was partially offset by the availability of more cost advantaged local light sweet crude oils which lowered our crude oil costs during the second half of 2008. Due to incremental production and supply of the crude oils in the region, we anticipate continued cost benefits.    

 Our gross refining margins were also impacted by our derivative positions during 2008. The rapid increase in crude oil prices during the first half of 2008 negatively impacted our derivative positions reducing our gross refining margins by $45 million year-over-year. During the 2008 second quarter, we closed the majority of our long-haul crude oil derivative positions.  

 Refining Throughput. During both 2008 and 2007, total refining throughput averaged 595 Mbpd. Excluding the Los Angeles refinery, throughput decreased by 37 Mbpd primarily reflecting throughput reductions at our Alaska, Hawaii and Washington refineries due to the weak market environment. For information related to scheduled downtime for both periods see footnote (i) of the table above.  

 Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased 28% to $26.8 billion in 2008 primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales  

 35   
 volumes. Our average refined product sales price increased 25% to $112.06 per barrel as higher average crude oil prices put upward pressure on product prices. Total refined product sales volumes increased reflecting additional sales volumes from operating our Los Angeles refinery for a full year in 2008. Excluding the Los Angeles refinery, total refined product sales volumes decreased by 55 Mbpd reflecting declining demand.  

 Costs of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased 31% to $102.37 per barrel during 2008, reflecting the significant increase in average crude oil prices during the year. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to $1.4 billion in 2008, compared with $1.2 billion in 2007, with $110 million of the increase incurred by the Los Angeles refinery. The remaining increase of $98 million primarily reflects higher utility costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $84 million as a result of a $91 million charge to write-off a receivable discussed above.  

 2007 Compared to 2006  

 Overview. The decrease in operating income of $288 million during 2007 was primarily due to reduced gross refining margins per barrel and increased operating expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by increased throughput. During 2007, total gross refining margin per barrel decreased by 7% from 2006, reflecting significantly lower industry margins on the U.S. West Coast during the last six months of 2007. U.S. refined product margins during the first six months of 2007 remained well above historical levels primarily due to strong product demand, lower industry refinery utilization due to heavy turnaround activity and unplanned outages, low product inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non-road diesel fuel beginning June 1, 2007. However, during the second half of 2007 industry refined product margins on the U.S. West Coast fell substantially as rising product prices lagged rapidly rising crude oil prices. Industry margins on the U.S. West Coast in the second half of 2006 were much stronger compared to the second half of 2007 reflecting stronger product demand, lower average product inventories and the introduction of new sulfur requirements for gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, during the 2006 fourth quarter we experienced record industry margins due to extensive industry turnaround activity and unplanned downtime on the U.S. West Coast.  

 Gross Refining Margins. On an aggregate basis, our total gross refining margins increased to $2.8 billion in 2007 from $2.6 billion in 2006, reflecting increased refining throughput as a result of acquiring the Los Angeles refinery partly offset by lower per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions, except the Mid-Continent region. Other regional factors impacting gross refining margins are described below.  

       During 2007, gross refining margins in our California and Pacific Northwest regions declined 15% and 3%, respectively. Factors that negatively impacted our gross refining margins in the California region during 2007 included: (i) the scheduled refinery maintenance turnarounds at our Golden Eagle refinery of the fluid catalytic cracker and hydrocracking units and subsequent extension of the fluid catalytic cracker turnaround during the first quarter due to unanticipated repairs and equipment malfunctions; (ii) unscheduled downtime at our Golden Eagle refinery during the third quarter which increased feedstock costs and reduced throughput; and (iii) contractual purchase commitments and certain refinery logistical limitations at our Los Angeles refinery which limited our ability to capture the cost differentials between foreign sourced and local crudes. The Pacific Northwest region was negatively impacted by unscheduled maintenance of the boiler unit for the fluid catalytic cracker and scheduled maintenance on two hydrotreating units at our Washington refinery during the 2007 third quarter resulting in reduced operating income of approximately $12 million.   

       In our Mid-Pacific region, gross refining margins declined 82% during 2007, reflecting the decline in U.S. West Coast industry margins during the second half of 2007. Crude oil costs in the region were impacted as Asian sweet crude oils realized higher premiums due to strong Asian demand. At the same time, several of our term product contracts have lagging pricing provisions as discussed above, which delayed our fully passing along the rising crude oil costs. In addition, an unplanned outage of the Hawaii refinerys reformer unit during the 2007 fourth quarter negatively impacted results by an estimated $30 million, including $10 million of higher repairs and maintenance expenses.   

       In our Mid-Continent region, gross refining margins increased 21% per barrel during 2007 reflecting strong product demand from the farming sector and unplanned refinery outages at several refineries during the first    

 36   
      half of 2007. We were also able to take advantage of more discounted local light sweet crudes during the 2007 fourth quarter.    

 Our gross refining margins were also impacted by our non-trading derivative positions during 2007. Our derivative positions were negatively impacted by rapidly rising crude oil costs, which reduced our gross refining margins by $104 million year-over-year. During 2007 and 2006, our derivative positions resulted in a $61 million loss and a $43 million gain, respectively.  

 Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput averaged 595 Mbpd in 2007 compared to 529 Mbpd during 2006, primarily reflecting average refining throughput at our Los Angeles refinery of 68 Mbpd (see footnote (b) of the table above for information related to refining throughput at our Los Angeles refinery). Scheduled downtime during 2007 and 2006 that negatively impacted refining throughput is described in footnote (i) of the table above. We also experienced unscheduled downtime in 2007 at our Golden Eagle, Washington and Hawaii refineries as described above. During 2006, we experienced unscheduled downtime at our Alaska refinery as a result of the grounding of our time-chartered vessel which impacted the supply of feedstocks to the refinery.  

 Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased 21% during 2007 primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes. Our average refined product sales price increased 10% to $89.47 per barrel reflecting the increase in crude oil prices. Total refined product sales volumes increased 57 Mbpd in 2007, primarily reflecting additional sales volumes from our Los Angeles refinery.  

 Costs of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased 13% to $78.14 per barrel during 2007, reflecting the significant increase in crude oil prices during the year. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to $1.2 billion in 2007, compared with $867 million in 2006, with $196 million of the increase incurred by the Los Angeles refinery. The remaining increase of $144 million reflects higher repairs and maintenance expenses of $52 million, increased employee costs of $42 million, higher marine charter expenses of $22 million and increased utilities costs of $18 million. Depreciation and amortization increased to $314 million in 2007, compared to $221 million in 2006, reflecting depreciation and amortization of $48 million associated with the Los Angeles refinery and increased depreciation from our recent investments in capital projects. Loss on asset disposals and impairments decreased by $31 million primarily due to charges of $28 million during 2006 relating to the termination of a delayed coker project at our Washington refinery.

Total gross margins increased by $131 million to $364 million reflecting significantly increased fuel sales volumes combined with higher fuel margin per gallon. Total gallons sold increased  

 38   
 to 1.4 billion gallons from 1.1 billion gallons in 2007, primarily reflecting additional volumes from the Shell and USA Gasoline stations acquired in May 2007. Fuel margin increased to $0.21 per gallon in 2008 from $0.15 per gallon in 2007, primarily reflecting retail prices lagging the rapid decrease in crude oil prices during the last half of 2008. Our Shell and USA Gasoline stations contributed additional gross margins of $96 million and additional fuel sales of 266 million gallons during 2008 reflecting operation for a full year in 2008. Excluding the acquired stations, total gross margins increased by $36 million and fuel sales volumes remained flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. The total number of retail stations in our retail network at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is summarized above. The decrease in our station count at December 31, 2008 is due to closing 42 Mirastar stations, partially offset by our strategy to grow our branded jobber/dealer presence in the Mid-Continent region and on the U.S. West Coast. In August 2008, we amended the ground lease agreement with Wal-Mart under which we operated 76 retail stations on Wal-Mart parking lots in the midwestern and western United States. Under the amendment, we closed 42 retail stations during 2008 and will continue to operate the remaining 34 retail stations.  

 Revenues on fuel sales increased to $4.2 billion in 2008, from $2.9 billion in 2007, reflecting significantly higher sales volumes and increased average sales prices. Excluding the acquired stations, revenues on fuel sales increased $191 million primarily due to higher average product sales prices. Costs of sales increased in 2008 due to increased sales volumes and higher average prices for purchased fuel. Operating expenses increased by $34 million during 2008 as compared to 2007. Shell and USA Gasoline retail stations contributed $40 million in additional operating expenses in 2008. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects operating the Shell and USA Gasoline stations for a full year in 2008. The loss on asset disposals and impairments increased by $22 million during 2008 primarily reflecting closing 42 Mirastar stations and the potential sale of 20 retail stations.  

 2007 Compared to 2006  The operating loss for our retail segment was $8 million during 2007, compared to an operating loss of $21 million in 2006. Total gross margins increased by $120 million to $233 million reflecting significantly increased fuel and merchandise volumes due to the increase in retail stations, partially offset by slightly lower fuel margins. Total gallons sold increased 664 million, reflecting the increase in the average retail station count during 2007. The Shell and USA Gasoline sites acquired in May 2007 contributed gross margins of $118 million and fuel sales of 643 million gallons. The remaining increase in gross margins of $2 million and fuel sales of 21 million gallons reflects an increase in our Tesoro-branded jobber/dealer retail stations. Fuel margin decreased to $0.15 per gallon in 2007 as retail prices lagged rising wholesale prices.  

 Revenues on fuel sales increased to $2.9 billion in 2007 from $1.1 billion in 2006, reflecting increased sales volumes and higher sales prices. Revenues on fuel sales from our acquired Shell and USA Gasoline stations totaled $1.8 billion during 2007. Costs of sales increased in 2007 due to increased sales volumes and higher average prices for purchased fuel. Operating expenses increased $95 million during 2007, of which $84 million represents operating expenses incurred by our acquired stations.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $325 million for 2008 compared to $263 million in 2007. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to a charge of $91 million to write-off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely. Excluding the receivable charge, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $29 million primarily due to lower stock-based and incentive compensation costs of $53 million, partially offset by higher employee costs of $19 million. Stock-based compensation for our stock appreciation rights (SARS) and phantom stock was lower due to our declining stock price. Our SARS and phantom stock are revalued to fair value at the end of each reporting period.  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses of $263 million in 2007 increased from $176 million in 2006. The increase during 2007 was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation costs of $31 million, higher employee expenses of $31 million reflecting increased head count, increased contract labor expenses of $12 million primarily associated with software implementation, and integration expenses related to our acquisitions totaling $11 million.  

 39   
 Interest and Financing Costs  

 Interest and financing costs were $111 million in 2008 compared to $91 million in 2007 and $77 million in 2006. The increases were primarily due to the additional debt we incurred in May 2007 associated with our acquisitions.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income decreased to $7 million during 2008 from $33 million in 2007 and $41 million in 2006. The decreases reflect significant decreases in our cash investments due to lower operating cash flows associated with a lower margin environment in 2008 as compared to 2007, and the use of cash to partially fund our acquisitions in 2007 and to repay borrowings on our revolver in 2008 and 2007.  

 Foreign Currency Exchange  

 During 2008, our foreign currency exchange gain was $12 million as compared to a loss of $4 million in 2007. The change was primarily a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar during the 2008 fourth quarter.  

 Other Income  

 Other income totaled $50 million in 2008 and $5 million in 2006. In 2008, we received refunds from TAPS in connection with rulings by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska concerning our protest of intrastate rates. We received net refunds totaling $50 million from TAPS concerning rates set between 1997 and 2003. In 2006, the sale of our leased corporate headquarters by a limited partnership, in which we were a 50% partner, resulted in a $5 million gain.  

 Income Tax Provision  

 The income tax provision amounted to $151 million in 2008 compared to $339 million in 2007 and $485 million in 2006. The fluctuations reflect decreases in earnings before income taxes. The combined federal and state effective income tax rates were 35%, 37% and 38% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of federal tax audits for the years 1996 through 2005 while the decrease in our effective income tax rate from 2006 to 2007 was primarily a result of an increase in the federal tax deduction for domestic manufacturing activities.   

 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY   

 Overview  

 Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit. Our credit agreement provides for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base or the agreements total capacity. On December 31, 2008, based on a crude oil (Alaska North Slope) price of $46 per barrel, our adjusted borrowing base was approximately $620 million. Our total capacity of $1.81 billion was increased by $110 million in 2008 and can be increased up to a total capacity of $1.95 billion. We also increased our separate letter of credit capacity by $170 million to $500 million during 2008. We increased our capacities due to the significant increase in crude prices in the first half of 2008. We ended 2008 with $20 million of cash and cash equivalents, $66 million of borrowings under our revolver, and $251 million in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after $303 million in outstanding letters of credit. We also have three separate letter of credit agreements of which we had $196 million available after $304 million in outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2008. During 2008, we reduced inventories by 5 million barrels through our working capital program to improve cash flows from operations. In 2009, we plan to fund our capital program of $460 million through operating cash flows. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in 2009.  

 Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (Lehman CPI) was one of the lenders under our credit agreement, representing a commitment of $50 million (less than 3% of our total credit agreement capacity). In October 2008,  

 40   
 Lehman CPI filed for bankruptcy. Lehman CPI will not participate in any future requests for funding and it is not certain whether another lender might assume its commitment. Our total capacity of $1.81 billion at December 31, 2008 reflects this commitment reduction. Based on the total amounts available under our credit agreement and separate letter of credit agreements and our anticipated utilization, we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs.  

 During the 2008 fourth quarter, our working capital was negatively impacted by a $91 million charge to write-off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely. We perform ongoing evaluations of our customers financial condition and the collectability of our receivables, and we have implemented certain enhancements for reviewing, monitoring and responding to these evaluations. In connection with the receivable write-off, we have initiated a lawsuit against the account debtor. We cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this lawsuit.  

 TAPS Refunds  

 In 1996, Tesoro Alaska Company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through TAPS. Our protest asserted that the TAPS intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced. The Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years 1997 through 2003. The RCA set just and reasonable final rates for the years 1997 through 2003 and held that we were entitled to receive refunds, including interest. In accordance with the rulings, in 2008 we received refunds from TAPS totaling $50 million, net of contingent legal fees.  

 Cash Dividends  

 On February 19, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.10 per share, payable on March 16, 2009 to shareholders of record on March 2, 2009. During 2008, we paid cash dividends on common stock of $0.40 per share totaling $55 million.  

 Capitalization  

 Our capital structure at December 31, 2008 was comprised of (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 At December 31, 2008, our debt to capitalization ratio was 33%, compared to 35% at year-end 2007, reflecting additional earnings and repayments on our revolving credit facility.  

 Our credit agreement and senior notes impose various restrictions and covenants as described below that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity capital, pay dividends, or repurchase stock. We do not believe that the limitations will restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock under our current programs.  

 Credit Agreement  Revolving Credit Facility  

 At December 31, 2008, our credit agreement provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base of approximately $620 million (based upon an  

 41   
 Alaska North Slope crude oil price of $46 per barrel), consisting of Tesoros eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories, net of the standard reserve as defined, or the agreements total capacity of $1.81 billion. The total capacity was increased by $110 million in May 2008 and can be further increased up to a total capacity of $1.95 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had $66 million in borrowings and $303 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, resulting in total unused credit availability of $251 million or 40% of the eligible borrowing base. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at either a base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2008) or a Eurodollar rate (0.436% at December 31, 2008) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin at December 31, 2008 was 0.875% in the case of the Eurodollar rate, but varies based upon our credit facility availability and credit ratings. Letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility incur fees at an annual rate tied to the applicable margin described above (0.875% at December 31, 2008). We also incur commitment fees for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an annual rate of 0.25% as of December 31, 2008. Our credit agreement expires in May 2012.  

 The credit agreement contains covenants and conditions that, among other things, limit our ability to pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments. Tesoro is also required to maintain a certain level of available borrowing capacity and specified levels of tangible net worth. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we satisfied all of the financial covenants under the credit agreement. The credit agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of Tesoros cash and cash equivalents, petroleum inventories and receivables. In February 2008, we amended our credit agreement to allow up to $100 million of restricted payments during any four quarter period subject to credit availability exceeding 20% of the borrowing base.  

 Letter of Credit Agreements  

 The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $500 million under separate letter of credit agreements for the purchase of foreign petroleum products. At December 31, 2008, we had three separate letter of credit agreements with a total capacity of $500 million, of which $304 million was outstanding. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the crude oil inventories supported by the issued letters of credit. The agreements may be terminated by either party, at any time.  

 61/2% Senior Notes Due 2017  

 In May 2007, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 61/2% senior notes due June 2017. The notes have a ten-year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are subject to optional redemption by Tesoro beginning June 2012 at premiums of 3.25% through May 2013; 2.17% from June 2013 through May 2014; 1.08% from June 2014 through May 2015; and at par thereafter. We have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of 106.5% with proceeds from certain equity issuances through June 1, 2010. The indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature. Substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if either Standard and Poors or Moodys assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture. The terminated covenants will not be restored even if the credit rating assigned to the notes subsequently falls below investment grade. The notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of our active domestic subsidiaries.  

 61/4% Senior Notes Due 2012  

 In November 2005, we issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 61/4% senior notes due November 2012. The notes have a seven-year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are not callable. The indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature and are identical to the covenants in the indenture for Tesoros 65/8% senior notes due 2015. Substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if either Standard and Poors or Moodys assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture. The terminated covenants will not be restored even if the credit rating assigned to the notes subsequently falls below investment grade. The notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active domestic subsidiaries.  

 42   
 65/8% Senior Notes Due 2015  

 In November 2005, we issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 65/8% senior notes due November 2015. The notes have a ten-year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are subject to optional redemption by Tesoro beginning November 2010 at premiums of 3.3% through October 2011, 2.2% from November 2011 to October 2012, 1.1% from November 2012 to October 2013, and at par thereafter. The indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature and are identical to the covenants in the indenture for Tesoros 61/4% senior notes due 2012. Substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if either Standard and Poors or Moodys assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture. The terminated covenants will not be restored even if the credit rating assigned to the notes subsequently falls below investment grade. The notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active domestic subsidiaries.  

 The indentures for our senior notes contain covenants and restrictions which are customary for notes of this nature. These covenants and restrictions limit, among other things, our ability to:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The indentures also limit our subsidiaries ability to create restrictions on making certain payments and distributions.  

 Junior Subordinated Notes Due 2012  

 In connection with our acquisition of the Golden Eagle refinery, Tesoro issued to the seller two ten-year junior subordinated notes with face amounts totaling $150 million. The notes consist of: (i) a $100 million junior subordinated note, due July 2012, which was non-interest bearing through May 2007, and carries a 7.5% interest rate thereafter, and (ii) a $50 million junior subordinated note, due July 2012, which incurred interest at 7.47% from May 2003 through May 2007 and 7.5% thereafter. We initially recorded these two notes at a combined present value of approximately $61 million, discounted at rates of 15.625% and 14.375%, respectively. We are amortizing the discount over the term of the notes.  

 Cash Flow Summary  

 Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Net cash from operating activities decreased to $716 million in 2008 primarily due to lower cash earnings and higher working capital requirements reflecting significantly lower payables associated with falling crude oil prices at year end. Net cash used in investing activities of $610 million in 2008 was primarily for capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects payments under our revolver and dividend payments of  

 43   
 $55 million. Gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled $5.65 billion, and we repaid $5.71 billion in borrowings during 2008. Working capital totaled $205 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $106 million at December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting lower payables, partially offset by decreased receivables and inventories. Payables and receivables decreased due to the lower prices of crude oil and refined products. Receivables decreased less than payables as a result of product prices lagging sharply falling crude oil prices. Inventories decreased from year end due in part to our efforts to reduce inventories as described above.  

 Net cash from operating activities increased during 2007 to $1.3 billion primarily due to lower working capital requirements reflecting an increase in payables due to the acquisitions and higher crude oil costs, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower earnings. Net cash used in investing activities of $2.8 billion in 2007 was primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2006, net cash used in investing activities of $430 million was primarily for capital expenditures. Net cash from financing activities in 2007 primarily reflects the indebtedness incurred as part of our acquisition of the Los Angeles refinery and borrowings on the revolver, partially offset by dividend payments of $48 million. In 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects repurchases of our common stock totaling $151 million (including $148 million under our common stock repurchase program) and dividend payments of $27 million. Gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled $1.1 billion, and we repaid $940 million of these borrowings during 2007. We did not have any borrowings or repayments under the revolving credit facility during 2006. Working capital decreased to $106 million at December 31, 2007 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006, primarily due to decreases in cash as a result of partially funding the acquisitions with cash and repayments on our revolver.  

 Capital Expenditures  

 During 2008, our capital expenditures totaled $619 million (including accruals) which consisted of: (i) regulatory projects (about 70% of total spending), (ii) sustaining projects (about 20% of total spending) and (iii) income improvements projects (about 10% of total spending). Our 2009 capital budget is $460 million and is comprised of: (i) regulatory projects (about 65% of the capital budget), (ii) sustaining projects (about 30% of the capital budget) and (iii) income improvement projects (about 5% of the capital budget). See Business Strategy and Overview and Environmental Capital Expenditures for additional information.  

 Refinery Turnaround Spending  

 During 2008, we spent $105 million for refinery turnarounds and catalyst, primarily at our Golden Eagle refinery and for turnarounds scheduled in 2009. In 2009, we expect to spend $140 million for refinery turnarounds, primarily at our Golden Eagle, Los Angeles, and Alaska refineries. Refining throughput and yields in 2009 will be affected by a planned outage at our Washington refinery during the first quarter and by scheduled turnarounds at our Golden Eagle and Alaska refineries during the second quarter and our Los Angeles refinery during the third quarter.  

 44   
 Long-Term Commitments  

 Contractual Commitments  

 We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes I and M in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings.  

  (b)    Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations represent our future minimum lease commitments. Operating lease commitments for 2009 include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.  

  (c)    Represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks, with remaining terms ranging from 1 year to 3 years. Prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate with market-responsive pricing provisions. To estimate our annual commitments under these contracts, we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices as of December 31, 2008, ranging by crude oil type from $45 per barrel to $54 per barrel, and volumes based on the contracts minimum purchase requirements. We also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short-term renewable contracts and in the spot market, which are not included in the table above.  

  (d)    Represents primarily long-term commitments for the transportation and storage of crude oil and to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contracts minimum volume requirements.  

  (e)    We have no minimum required contribution obligation to our pension plan under applicable laws and regulations. Contributions are subject to change based on the performance of the assets in the plan, the discount rate used to determine the obligation, and other actuarial assumptions. See Critical Accounting Policies for further information related to our pension plan. We are unable to project benefit contributions beyond 2013.   

 In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $44 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, $15 million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet. With the exception of amounts classified as current liabilities, we are uncertain as to when such amounts may be settled. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $27 million at December 31, 2008, $20 million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet. See Note K in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.  

 45   
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Other than our leasing arrangements described in Note M to our consolidated financial statements, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.  

 Environmental and Other Matters  

 We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Where required, we have made accruals in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, in order to provide for these matters. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters with certainty. However, we have made accruals based on our best estimates, subject to future developments. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material adverse impact on interim or annual results of operations.  

 Tesoro is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls, or make other modifications or changes in certain emission sources.  

 Conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites, including, but not limited to, our refineries, tank farms, pipelines, retail stations (operating and closed locations) and refined products terminals, and for compliance with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future expenditures.  

 Tesoro is subject to audits by federal, state and local taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in claims against Tesoro in excess of recorded liabilities. We believe, however, that when these matters are resolved, they will not materially affect Tesoros consolidated financial position or results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a $6 million income tax benefit from the favorable settlement of federal tax audits for the years 1996 through 2005. Although the income tax liability has been settled, years 2002, 2003 and 2005 remain open to adjustment pending the settlement of interest. All tax liabilities resulting from these audits were previously recorded as unrecognized tax benefits in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48).  

 Environmental Liabilities  

 We are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites, including certain of our previously owned properties. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled $123 million and $90 million, respectively. Our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties, refining, pipeline and terminal operations and retail stations. We believe these accruals are adequate, based on currently available information, including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions. These estimated environmental liabilities require judgment to assess and estimate the future costs to remediate. It is reasonably possible that additional remediation costs will be incurred as more information becomes available related to these environmental matters.  

 In March 2007, we settled our dispute with a prior owner of our Golden Eagle refinery concerning soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery. We received $58.5 million in settlement proceeds in exchange for assuming responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to August 2000. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our accruals for these environmental liabilities totaled $87 million and $64 million, respectively, which are included in the environmental accruals referenced above. We cannot presently estimate additional remedial activities that may be required at the Golden Eagle refinery. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional remediation costs as more information becomes available. We expect to have valid insurance claims under certain environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to $140 million for  

 46   
 liabilities in excess of the settlement proceeds. Amounts recorded for these environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible insurance recoveries.  

 We are continuing to investigate environmental conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Golden Eagle refinery. This investigation is driven by an order from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board that names us as well as two previous owners of the Golden Eagle refinery. A reserve to investigate these conditions is included in the environmental accruals referenced above.  

 In July 2008, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA for the Washington refinery. EPA alleged that prior to our acquisition of the refinery certain modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the Clear Air Act. In October 2005, we received a NOV from EPA concerning the refinery also alleging that prior to our acquisition of the refinery certain other modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the Clean Air Act. We have investigated the allegations and we cannot estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the NOVs. However, at this time we believe the final resolution of the NOVs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We believe we have defenses to the allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. A reserve for our response to the NOVs is included in the environmental accruals referenced above.  

 Other Matters  

 In the ordinary course of business, we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable, and some matters may require years for us to resolve. As a result, we have not established reserves for these matters and the matters described below. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 On February 3, 2009, we received a NOV from the EPA relating to our compliance with the Clean Air Act and the corresponding regulations concerning the regulation of fuels and fuel additives. The allegations arise from a compliance review conducted by the EPA in 2006 for the years 2003 through the time of the review in 2006. We are investigating the allegations contained in the NOV and we cannot estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of this NOV. However, at this time we believe the final resolution of this NOV will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 In October 2008, we settled seven of the ten pending cases alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. In January 2009, we were served with an additional lawsuit alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. We are a defendant, along with other manufacturing, supply and marketing defendants, in all of the cases. The defendants are being sued for having manufactured MTBE and having manufactured, supplied and distributed gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs in the four cases, all in California, are municipalities and governmental authorities. The plaintiffs allege, in part, that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees. A reserve for the three cases pending on December 31, 2008 was included in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2008. We believe the resolution of the four remaining cases will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position or results of operations. We believe we have defenses against these claims and intend to vigorously defend them.  

 In October 2008, we received an NOV from the EPA concerning our Utah refinery alleging certain violations of the Clean Air Act at the refinery beginning in 2004. We are investigating the allegations contained in the NOV and cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution. However, we believe the final resolution of this NOV will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  

 Environmental Capital Expenditures  

 EPA regulations related to the Clean Air Act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline. In December 2008, a gasoline hydrotreater was commissioned at our Utah refinery to satisfy the requirements of  

 47   
 the regulations. We spent $50 million in 2008 to complete the project. Our refineries will not require any additional capital spending to meet the low sulfur gasoline standards.  

 In May 2004, the EPA issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non-road diesel fuel. The requirements to reduce non-road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases through 2012. At our North Dakota refinery, we expect to spend $9 million in 2009 to meet the standards. We are currently evaluating alternative projects that will satisfy the future requirements under existing regulations at our Utah and Hawaii refineries. Our Golden Eagle, Los Angeles, Washington and Alaska refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the diesel fuel standards.  

 In February 2007, the EPA issued regulations for the reduction of benzene in gasoline. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard; however, based on our most recent estimates we expect to spend approximately $270 million to $340 million through 2011 to meet the regulations at five of our refineries. These cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis. During 2008, we spent $13 million to meet this regulation. Our Golden Eagle and Los Angeles refineries will not require capital spending to meet the benzene reduction standards.  

 During the fourth quarter of 2005, we received approval by the Hearing Board for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to modify our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker at our Golden Eagle refinery which is designed to lower emissions while also enhancing the refinerys capabilities in terms of crude oil flexibility, reliability, lengthening turnaround cycles and lowering maintenance costs. We negotiated the terms and conditions of the Second Conditional Abatement Order with the District in response to the January 2005 mechanical failure of the fluid coker boiler at the Golden Eagle refinery. The coker became fully operational during the 2008 second quarter. We spent $602 million from inception of the project, $103 million of which was spent in 2008.  

 Regulations issued by Californias South Coast Air Quality Management District (the District) require the emission of nitrogen oxides to be reduced through 2011 at our Los Angeles refinery. We plan to meet this requirement by replacing less efficient power cogeneration units and steam boilers with more efficient equipment. The District has determined that it cannot issue a permit for this replacement project until it revises its regulation (and, in fact, has implemented a temporary ban on a broad class of air permits). We are evaluating other alternatives to meet the reduction requirements during the short term pending the completion of the equipment replacement project. During 2008, we spent $48 million and we expect to spend an additional $250 million to $325 million beginning in 2009 for the equipment replacement and short-term alternative projects. In 2009, we expect to spend approximately $56 million for design and procurement for the equipment replacement and to evaluate the short-term alternative projects.  

 Other projects at our Los Angeles refinery include replacing underground pipelines with above-ground pipelines as required by an Order from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. We spent $5 million in 2008 and expect to spend an additional $60 million to $80 million through 2014 to complete the project. In 2008, we also installed new flare gas recovery compressors designed to meet flaring requirements of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The new compressors were commissioned in December 2008. We spent $34 million in 2008 to install the flare gas recovery compressors.  

 We are installing facilities at our Golden Eagle and North Dakota refineries to eliminate the use of atmospheric blowdown towers by rerouting these emergency relief systems. We believe that this plan will provide safer operating conditions for our employees and will address environmental regulatory issues related to monitoring potential air emissions from components connected to the blowdown towers. We spent $53 million in 2008 and expect to spend an additional $52 million through 2011. Our other refineries do not have emergency relief systems routed to atmospheric blowdown towers.  

 We will spend additional capital at the Golden Eagle refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above-ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery through 2013. During 2008, we spent $18 million and expect to spend an additional $90 million through 2013. We are also evaluating alternative projects for our wharves at the Golden Eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the State of California in February 2006. These project alternatives could cost between $50 million and $200 million between 2009 and 2015. The timing of these projects is subject to negotiations with the appropriate regulatory agency.  

 48   
 In connection with our 2001 acquisition of our North Dakota and Utah refineries, Tesoro assumed the sellers obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the United States, BP Exploration and Oil Co. (BP), Amoco Oil Company and Atlantic Richfield Company. BP entered into this consent decree for both the North Dakota and Utah refineries for various alleged violations. As the owner of these refineries, Tesoro is required to address issues to reduce air emissions. Based upon our current plans, we spent $5 million in 2008 and expect to spend an additional $27 million through 2010 to comply with this consent decree. We also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree.  

 California Air Resources Board regulations require the installation of enhanced vapor recovery and in-station diagnostic systems at all California gasoline retail stations by April 2009. The enhanced vapor recovery systems control and contain gasoline vapor emissions during motor vehicle fueling. We spent $12 million during 2008 and expect to spend an additional $11 million in 2009 to satisfy the requirements of these regulations.  

 In December 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which, among other things, modified the industry requirements for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). This standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and biodiesel) sold or introduced in the U.S. to be 11.1 billion gallons in 2009 rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Both requirements could reduce demand growth for petroleum products in the future. In the near term, the RFS presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for both the ethanol and refining and marketing industries and may require additional expenditures by us to accommodate increased ethanol use.  

 In June 2007, the California Air Resources Board proposed amendments to the requirements for gasoline in the state of California that decreases the allowable sulfur levels to 20 parts per million and allows for additional ethanol to be blended into gasoline. The requirements begin December 31, 2009 but may be postponed by individual companies until December 31, 2011 through the use of the Alternative Emission Reduction Plan which allows for the acquisition of emissions offsets from sources not directly related to petroleum fuel use. We expect both of our California refineries to be in compliance with the regulation by the 2009 deadline and expect to spend approximately $1 million through 2010 to meet the requirements.  

 The cost estimates for the environmental projects described above are subject to further review and analysis and include estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs.  

 Pension Funding  

 For all eligible employees, we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 8.5%, and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a loss of $94 million in 2008 and a gain of $24 million in 2007. Based on a 6.28% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2008, the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 56% of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of 2008. At January 1, 2008 the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations) was 119%. Although Tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in 2008, we voluntarily contributed $18 million to improve the funded status of the plan. We currently plan to contribute approximately $25 million in 2009. Future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets, employee demographics and other factors. See Note L in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.  

 Claims Against Third-Parties  

 In 1996, Tesoro Alaska Company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). Our protest asserted that the TAPS intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced. The Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years 1997 through 2000. The RCA set just and reasonable final rates for the years 1997 through 2000, and held that we were entitled to receive refunds, including interest. In accordance with the ruling, in March 2008 we received a refund from TAPS of $45 million, net of contingent legal fees. The $45 million refund is included as Other income in our statement of consolidated operations.  

 49   
 In 2002, the RCA rejected the TAPS Carriers proposed intrastate rate increases for 2001-2003 and maintained the rate of $1.96 to the Valdez Marine Terminal. The rate decrease has been in effect since June 2003. In June 2008, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld the $1.96 rate for the years 2001 through 2003. We were awarded refunds in June and July 2008 including interest totaling $5 million, net of contingent legal fees, for the period 2001 through June 2003. The rates paid from mid-June 2003 through June 2008 were also upheld. The $5 million refund is included as Other income in our statement of consolidated operations.  

 In January of 2005, Tesoro Alaska Company intervened in a protest before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), of the TAPS Carriers interstate rates for 2005 and 2006. In July 2005, the TAPS Carriers filed a proceeding at the FERC seeking to have the FERC assume jurisdiction under Section 13(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act and set future rates for intrastate transportation on TAPS. We filed a protest in that proceeding, which was consolidated with the other FERC proceeding seeking to set just and reasonable interstate rates on TAPS for 2005 and 2006. In June 2008, the FERC issued a final order in this consolidated FERC proceeding that lowered those interstate rates and refused to revise the current intrastate rates. The TAPS Carriers have sought rehearing and appealed the FERC order. We cannot give assurances of whether they will ultimately prevail in any such rehearing or appeal. However, should the TAPS Carriers prevail, the result will not have a material impact on our operations or financial results in future reporting periods but could affect our future costs in the ordinary course of business.   

 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our accounting policies are described in Note A in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.  

 Receivables  Our trade receivables are stated at their invoiced amounts, less an allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts. We monitor the credit and payment experience of our customers and manage our loss exposure through our credit policies and procedures. The estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our general loss experience and identified loss exposures on individual accounts. During 2008, we wrote-off a $91 million receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely. With the exception of this write-off, actual losses in our historical results of operations have not been significant. Actual losses could vary from estimates, as global economic conditions and the related credit environment could change.  

 Inventory  Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We primarily use the LIFO method to determine the cost of our crude oil and refined product inventories. The LIFO cost of these inventories is usually much less than current market value, however, a significant decline in market values of crude oil and refined products could impair the carrying values of these inventories. We had 24 million barrels of crude oil and refined product inventories at December 31, 2008 with an average cost of approximately $29 per barrel on a LIFO basis. If crude oil and refined product prices decline below the average cost, then we would be required to write down the value of our inventories in future periods. The use of LIFO may also result in increases or decreases to costs of sales in years when inventory volumes decline and result in costs of sales associated with inventory layers established in prior periods. During 2008, a reduction in inventory quantities resulted in a liquidation of applicable LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years. This LIFO liquidation resulted in a decrease in costs of sales of $138 million.  

 Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles  We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, global economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. We evaluate these assets for potential impairment when an asset disposition is probable or by  

 50   
 identifying whether indicators of impairment exist (for example, operating losses) and, if so, assessing whether the asset values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss, if any, to be recorded is equal to the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

 Goodwill  As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had goodwill of $89 million and $92 million, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. We review the recorded value of our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value, including the related goodwill, of that reporting unit. We use the present value of expected net cash flows and a market approach using recent sales transactions and current stock prices to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The impairment test is susceptible to change from period to period as it requires us to make cash flow assumptions including, among other things, future margins, volumes, operating costs, capital expenditures, growth rates and discount rates. Our assumptions regarding future margins and volumes require significant judgment as actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to do so. Changes in market conditions could result in impairment charges in the future. During 2008, we wrote-off goodwill of $3 million associated with our retail segment in connection with our annual assessment based upon forecasted discounted cash flows.  

 Contingencies  We record an estimated loss from a contingency when information available before issuing our financial statements indicates that (a) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We are required to use our judgment to account for contingencies such as environmental, legal and income tax matters. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, the actual loss may differ from our estimated loss, and we would record the necessary adjustments in future periods. We do not record the benefits of contingent recoveries or gains until the amount is determinable and recovery is assured.  

 Environmental Liabilities  At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our total environmental liabilities included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities were $123 million and $90 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties. Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our total environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. Our estimated liabilities are not discounted to present value.  

 Income Taxes  As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred income tax assets. Based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $9 million on certain state credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2008. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods, we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance. Beginning January 1, 2007 with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken that are not recognized  

 51   
 under the pronouncement are recorded as liabilities. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties totaled $71 million and $67 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Asset Retirement Obligations  Our asset retirement obligations totaled $35 million and $82 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record asset retirement obligations in the period in which the obligations are incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We use the present value of expected cash flows using third-party estimates or historical data to estimate fair value. The calculation of fair value is based on several estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, projected cash flows, inflation, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, the settlement dates or a range of potential settlement dates and the probabilities associated with settlement. We consider our past practice, industry practice, managements intent and estimated economic lives to estimate settlement dates. Our estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the retirement and technological improvements associated with the retirement activities. We cannot currently make reasonable estimates of the fair values of some retirement obligations, principally those associated with our refineries, pipelines and certain terminals and retail stations, because the related assets have indeterminate useful lives which preclude development of assumptions about the potential timing of settlement dates. Such obligations will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must also assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status and a liability for our plans underfunded status. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans assets and its projected benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the pension plans would have had the following effects in 2008 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 See Note L in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.  

 Stock-Based Compensation  We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and other certain stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock-based awards. The estimated fair value of our stock appreciation rights and phantom stock are revalued at the end of each reporting period, and changes in our assumptions may impact our liabilities and expenses associated with these awards.
