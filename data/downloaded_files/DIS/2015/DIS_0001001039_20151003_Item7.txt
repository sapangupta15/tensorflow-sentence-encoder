CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS

2015 vs. 2014 

Revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 7%, or $3.7 billion, to $52.5 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 12%, or $881 million, to $8.4 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) for the year increased 15%, or $0.64 to $4.90. The EPS increase in fiscal 2015 reflected improved operating performance and a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, partially offset by the write-off of a deferred tax asset (discussed below) and lower investment gains. The current year results also include the benefit from a fifty-third week of operations due to the timing of our fiscal period end. Fiscal 2016 will include fifty-two weeks of operations. The impact of the additional week of operations was the most significant at our cable networks, domestic parks and consumer products businesses.

Revenues

Service revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 9%, or $3.7 billion, to $43.9 billion primarily due to higher MVPD fees (Affiliate Fees), volume growth and higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher SVOD sales of our television and film properties, an increase in merchandise licensing and advertising revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by an adverse impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.

Product revenues for fiscal 2015 were comparable to the prior year as higher food, beverage and merchandise volumes and average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts and increased revenues at our retail business were offset by lower worldwide home entertainment and console game volumes and an adverse impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.

Costs and expenses

Cost of services for fiscal 2015 increased 9%, or $1.8 billion, to $23.2 billion primarily due to higher sports

programming costs, inflation and operations support costs at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.

Cost of products for fiscal 2015 increased 2%, or $109 million, to $5.2 billion driven by volume growth at domestic parks and resorts and our retail business and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts. These increases were partially offset by lower home entertainment and console game unit sales and the impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs were comparable to the prior year as higher labor costs driven by the ABC Television Network, ESPN and Corporate and higher information technology costs at domestic parks and resorts were offset by lower marketing costs and the impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. The decrease in marketing costs was due to lower spending for theatrical and home entertainment marketing, partially offset by increases at ABC, ESPN and our merchandise licensing business.

26
Depreciation and amortization costs increased 3%, or $66 million, to $2.4 billion driven by new theme park attractions and, to a lesser extent, new broadcast facilities and equipment, partially offset by the impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $53 million and $140 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Charges in fiscal 2015 were primarily due to a contract termination and severance. Charges in 2014 were primarily due to severance costs across various of our segments and radio FCC license impairments, which were determined in connection with a plan to sell Radio Disney stations. 

Other Expense, net

Other expense, net is as follows (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest Income/(Expense), net

Interest income/(expense), net is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in interest expense was due to higher capitalized interest driven by the continued development of the Shanghai Disney Resort and lower average debt balances, partially offset by the impact of an additional week and higher effective interest rates.

The decrease in interest and investment income was due to lower gains on sales of investments and income on late payments recognized in the prior year in connection with the settlement of an affiliate contract dispute.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Equity in the income of investees decreased 5%, or $40 million, to $0.8 billion primarily due to a decrease at Hulu, partially offset by an increase at A&E.

Effective Income Tax Rate 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a write-off of a $399 million deferred income tax asset as a result of the increase in the Company’s ownership of Euro Disney S.C.A. in connection with the Disneyland Paris recapitalization. This increase was partially offset by a benefit from an increase in earnings from foreign operations indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, which are subject to tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate.

27
Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year decreased $33 million to $470 million due to lower operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and higher pre-opening expenses at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by an increase at Disneyland Paris. The increase at Disneyland Paris was driven by higher net income, partially offset by the impact of the Company’s change in ownership interest.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes.

2014 vs. 2013 

Revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 8%, or $3.8 billion, to $48.8 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 22%, or $1.4 billion, to $7.5 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) for the year increased 26% or $0.88 to $4.26. The EPS increase in fiscal 2014 reflected improved operating performance, a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and higher investment gains.

Revenues

Service revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 8%, or $3.0 billion, to $40.2 billion driven by the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Frozen, higher Affiliate Fees at ESPN, Broadcasting and the domestic Disney Channels, increased average guest spending for admissions and occupancy at our domestic parks and resorts operations, higher advertising revenues at ESPN and an increase in merchandise licensing revenue driven by Frozen and Disney Channel properties.

Product revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 10%, or $0.8 billion, to $8.6 billion reflecting higher worldwide home entertainment revenues driven by Frozen, increased guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise and higher volumes at our domestic parks and resorts operations and growth at our console games business driven by the success of Disney Infinity.

Costs and expenses

Cost of services for fiscal 2014 increased 6%, or $1.3 billion, to $21.4 billion driven by higher programming costs at ESPN and the ABC Television Network and an increase at our domestic parks and resorts due to MyMagic+, higher volumes and labor cost inflation.

Cost of products for fiscal 2014 increased 2%, or $120 million, to $5.1 billion driven by higher home entertainment unit sales, higher costs at our console games business driven by Disney Infinity and labor and other cost inflation and higher volumes at our domestic parks and resorts operations, partially offset by lower average home entertainment per unit costs.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 2%, or $200 million, to $8.6 billion primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by more titles in wide release.

Depreciation and amortization costs increased 4%, or $96 million, to $2.3 billion driven by MyMagic+ at our domestic parks and resorts operations.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $214 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2013 for severance, contract and lease terminations and intangible and other asset impairments.

Other Expense, net

Other expense, net is as follows (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

28
Interest Income/(Expense), net

Interest income/(expense), net is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in interest expense was due to lower effective interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt balances.

The increase in interest and investment income was primarily due to gains on sales of investments. Interest income also benefited from income on late payments recognized in connection with the settlement of an affiliate contract dispute.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Equity in the income of investees increased 24%, or $166 million, to $0.9 billion driven by the absence of a charge in the prior year for our share of expense related to an equity redemption at Hulu LLC (Hulu Equity Redemption).

Effective Income Tax Rate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2013, which included an increase in prior-year earnings from foreign operations indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, which are subject to tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $3 million to $503 million driven by improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a lower impact related to ESPN driven by after-tax gains recognized in fiscal 2013 on the sales of ESS and the ESPN UK business.

Certain Items Impacting Comparability

Results for fiscal 2015 were impacted by the following:

•A non-cash charge in connection with the write-off of a deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Company’s ownership of Euro Disney S.C.A. in connection with the Disneyland Paris recapitalization ($399 million).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

31
Media Networks

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 13% increase in Affiliate Fee revenue was due to an increase of 8% from higher contractual rates, 3% from an increase in subscribers, 2% from the benefit of an additional week of operations, and 1% from new contractual provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 2% due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. The increase in subscribers was due to the launch of the SEC Network in the fourth quarter of the prior year, partially offset by a decline in subscribers at certain of our cable networks. 

The 4% increase in advertising revenues was due to an increase of $206 million at Cable Networks, from $4,128 million to $4,334 million, and an increase of $124 million at Broadcasting, from $3,903 million to $4,027 million. The increase at Cable Networks was due to a 6% increase from units sold, a 3% increase from rates and 1% from the benefit of an additional week of operation, partially offset by a 6% decrease from ratings. The increase at Broadcasting was due to a 2% increase from network rates and a 2% increase from an additional week of operations.

TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $385 million from $2,489 million to $2,874 million due to higher SVOD sales in the current year.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $1,149 million from $10,229 million to $11,378 million. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $868 million due to higher rights costs for NFL programming (including a wild card playoff game) and college football, and the addition of the SEC Network, partially offset by the end of the NASCAR contract in the first quarter of the current year. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $281 million primarily due to higher program sales and programming costs for an additional week of operations.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $226 million from $2,643 million to $2,869 million driven by higher labor and marketing costs.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Income from equity investees decreased $42 million from $856 million to $814 million primarily due to a decrease at Hulu driven by higher programming and marketing costs, partially offset by an increase at A&E. The increase at A&E was due to lower programming and marketing costs, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 6%, or $472 million, to $7,793 million due to increases at the Disney Channels, ESPN, the owned television stations and the ABC Television Network.

32
The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Restructuring and impairment charges and Other expense, net 

The Company recorded charges of $62 million, $78 million and $85 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, that were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The charges in fiscal 2015 were due to a contract termination and severance. The charges in fiscal 2014 were due to radio FCC license and investment impairments and severance. The charges in fiscal 2013 were primarily for severance and contract settlement costs.

 The Company recorded a $100 million loss related to Cable Networks in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency, which was reported in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Parks and Resorts

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 7%, or $1.1 billion, to $16.2 billion due to an increase of $1.3 billion at our domestic operations, partially offset by a decrease of $219 million at our international operations.

Revenue growth of 10% at our domestic operations reflected increases of 5% from higher volumes and 5% from higher average guest spending. Higher volumes were due to attendance growth and higher occupied room nights. Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices for admissions at our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, increased food, beverage and merchandise spending and higher average hotel room rates. Revenues also benefited from an additional week of operations in the current year.

Revenues at our international operations reflected an 11% decrease from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 4% increase from higher average guest spending. Guest spending growth was due to higher food, beverage and merchandise spending, an increase in average ticket prices and higher average hotel room rates. Volumes at our international operations were essentially flat, as higher attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris were offset by lower attendance and occupied room nights at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.

33
The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $347 million from $4,233 million to $4,580 million, cost of sales, which increased $80 million from $1,425 million to $1,505 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased $27 million from $1,854 million to $1,881 million. The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher employee benefit costs and increased labor hours. The increase in employee benefit costs included higher pension and postretirement medical costs. The increase in labor hours was driven by higher volumes and new guest offerings, such as the 60th Anniversary Celebration at Disneyland Resort. Higher cost of sales was due to volume growth and inflation. Infrastructure cost increases were driven by higher information technology expense and operations support costs, partially offset by costs incurred in the prior year in connection with the launch of MyMagic+. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased primarily due to inflation, higher operations support costs and pre-opening costs for Shanghai Disney Resort. Operating expenses included a 2% decrease from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, partially offset by a 2% increase as a result of an additional week of operations, both of which had similar impacts on operating labor, cost of sales and infrastructure costs. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $28 million from $1,856 million to $1,884 million primarily due to information technology initiatives, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by new attractions, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 14%, or $368 million, to $3.0 billion due to growth at our domestic operations, partially offset by a decrease at our international operations.

34
Studio Entertainment

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Revenues

The 5% decrease in theatrical distribution revenue was due to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies and the impact of having no DreamWorks titles in the current year compared to four in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the performance of Inside Out and Big Hero 6 in the current year compared to Frozen and Planes: Fire and Rescue in the prior year, as well as one additional Disney live-action release in the current year. Significant Disney live-action releases in the current year included Cinderella and Into the Woods, whereas the prior year included Maleficent. The performance of Marvel’s Avengers: Age of Ultron and Marvel’s Ant-Man in the current year was comparable to the prior-year performance of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Marvel’s Thor: The Dark World.

The 14% decrease in home entertainment revenue was due to decreases of 9% from lower unit sales and 4% from lower average net effective pricing, both of which reflected the strong performance of Frozen in the prior year. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns.

The 18% increase in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to increases of 9% from higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment due to the success of merchandise based on Frozen and 7% from TV/SVOD distribution. TV/SVOD distribution revenue growth was primarily due to worldwide pay television, which included the benefit of more titles available domestically and sales of Star Wars titles internationally, and international SVOD sales.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include a decrease of $12 million in film cost amortization, from $1,802 million to $1,790 million, primarily due to decreased film cost impairments, partially offset by the impact of higher revenues and a higher average film cost amortization rate for theatrical releases in the current year due to the success of Frozen in the prior year. Operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decreased $75 million, from $1,335 million to $1,260 million due to lower home entertainment per unit costs and unit sales.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $252 million from $2,456 million to $2,204 million due to lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing expense. Lower theatrical marketing expense was primarily due to four DreamWorks titles in release in the prior year compared to none in the current year and the impact of foreign currency translation. The decrease in home entertainment marketing expense was driven by spending on Monsters University in the prior year compared to no Pixar title in the current year.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased $424 million to $2.0 billion due to higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment, increases in TV/SVOD and theatrical distribution and lower film cost impairments, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment.

Restructuring and impairment charges and Other expense, net 

The Company recorded charges of $0, $7 million and $18 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, that were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The charges in fiscal 2013 were primarily for severance costs.

35
The Company recorded a $31 million loss related to Studio Entertainment in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency, which was reported in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Consumer Products

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 14% increase in licensing and publishing revenues was driven by a 13% increase from our merchandise licensing business due to the performance of merchandise based on Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars classic, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.

The 12% increase in retail and other revenue was driven by a 10% increase from our retail business, due to comparable store and online sales growth in our key markets, growth in our wholesale distribution business and the benefit of an additional week of operations, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. 

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include an increase of $93 million in cost of goods sold, from $680 million to $773 million due to higher sales at our retail business, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating expenses also include labor, distribution and occupancy costs, which decreased $17 million from $870 million to $853 million. The decrease was due to lower third-party royalty expense at our merchandise licensing business and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher labor and distribution costs at our retail business. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $57 million from $778 million to $835 million primarily due to higher marketing costs. 

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 29% to $1.8 billion due to an increase at our merchandise licensing business and, to a lesser extent, at our retail business.

Restructuring and impairment charges and Other expense, net 

The Company recorded charges of $0, $0 and $49 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, that were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The charges in fiscal 2013 were primarily due to severance costs.

The Company recorded a $16 million loss related to Consumer Products in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency, which was reported in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

36
Interactive

Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Games revenues decreased $88 million from $1,056 million to $968 million due to decreases of 7% from sales of console games and 2% from lower Club Penguin subscribers, partially offset by an increase of 2% from mobile games. The decrease in sales of console games was due to lower unit sales of catalog titles and Disney Infinity and lower licensing revenues reflecting the performance of Lego Marvel Super Heroes in the prior year. The increase at our mobile games business was driven by the success of Tsum Tsum, Star Wars Commander, Marvel Universe titles and Knights of the Old Republic, partially offset by lower performance of catalog titles and Avengers Alliance.

Revenue from other content decreased $37 million from $243 million to $206 million due to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, a decrease at our mobile phone business in Japan driven by lower subscriptions, and lower online advertising revenues.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include a $4 million increase in cost of sales from $418 million to $422 million and a $23 million decrease in product development from $282 million to $259 million. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher per unit costs for Disney Infinity, which included the impact of inventory obsolescence charges, and a higher cost mix of Disney Infinity products sold, partially offset by lower unit sales of console games catalog titles. Lower product development costs were due to fewer titles in development and the benefit of previous restructuring activities. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $123 million from $460 million to $337 million driven by lower marketing and selling costs. The decrease was primarily due to our mobile phone business in Japan and our mobile games business due to fewer titles in release. 

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating results improved from $116 million to $132 million primarily due to growth at our mobile games business partially offset by a decrease at our console games business.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded credits of $4 million and charges of $44 million and $11 million related to Interactive for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Charges in fiscal year 2014 were primarily due to severance costs. These charges were reported in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS – 2014 vs. 2013

Media Networks

Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 6% increase in Affiliate Fee revenue was due to an increase of 8% from higher contractual rates and an increase of 1% from an increase in subscribers, partially offset by a decrease of 2% due to the sale of our ESPN UK business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and a decrease of 1% due to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. The increase in subscribers was driven by international subscriber growth and the launch of the SEC Network, partially offset by a decline in domestic subscribers.

The 1% increase in advertising revenues was due to an increase of $165 million at Cable Networks, from $3,963 million to $4,128 million, partially offset by a decrease of $57 million at Broadcasting, from $3,960 million to $3,903 million. The increase at Cable Networks was driven by a 6% increase from higher rates and a 3% increase from more units delivered, partially offset by a 4% decrease from lower ratings. The decrease in advertising revenues at Broadcasting was due to a 2% decrease from lower units delivered, a 1% decrease due to lower owned television stations revenue and a 1% decrease from lower network ratings, partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher network rates.

TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $74 million from $2,415 million to $2,489 million driven by the inclusion of revenues from Maker Studios, Lucasfilm SVOD sales and higher international program syndication fees at ESPN. 

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $526 million from $9,703 million to $10,229 million. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $378 million due to contractual rate increases for sports programming rights and the airing of FIFA World Cup soccer, partially offset by a decrease as a result of the sale of our ESPN UK business and lower production costs for international X Games events that have been discontinued. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $148 million due to a contractual rate increase for Modern Family and higher program write-offs.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $125 million from $2,768 million to $2,643 driven by lower marketing and labor costs. Marketing costs declined at the domestic Disney Channels and ESPN, partially offset by an increase at the international Disney Channels driven by a new channel in Germany that was launched in January 2014 and higher affiliate support in Latin America. Lower marketing costs at the domestic Disney Channels reflected decreased affiliate marketing support including the absence of fiscal 2013 costs to launch the Watch Disney Channel apps. The decrease at ESPN was due to the sale of the ESPN UK business. The reduction in labor costs was driven by lower pension costs.

Equity in the Income of Investees

Income from equity investees increased $114 million from $742 million to $856 million primarily due to an increase at 

A&E driven by higher advertising and affiliate revenues.

38
Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 7%, or $503 million, to $7,321 million due to increases at ESPN, the domestic Disney Channels, A&E, ABC Family, the owned television stations and the ABC Television Network, partially offset by a decrease at the international Disney Channels.

The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Parks and Resorts

Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Parks and Resorts revenues increased 7%, or $1.0 billion, to $15.1 billion due to an increase of $935 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $77 million at our international operations.

Revenue growth of 8% at our domestic operations reflected increases of 5% from higher average guest spending and 2% from higher volumes. Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices for admissions at our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line and increased food, beverage and merchandise spending. Higher volumes were due to attendance growth and higher occupied room nights.

Revenue growth of 3% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase from higher average guest spending and a 1% increase from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 3% decrease from lower volumes. Guest spending growth was due to higher average ticket prices and higher merchandise, food and beverage spending. Lower volumes were due to decreases in attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris.

39
The following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units.

(2) Per capita guest spending growth rate is stated on a constant currency basis. Per room guest spending is stated at the fiscal 2013 average foreign currency exchange rate. The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.36, $1.31 and $1.30 for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $139 million from $4,094 million to $4,233 million, cost of sales, which increased $77 million from $1,348 million to $1,425 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased $99 million from $1,755 million to $1,854 million. The increase in operating labor was primarily due to inflation, new guest offerings, including MyMagic+, and higher volumes, partially offset by lower pension and postretirement medical costs. The increase in cost of sales was due to higher volumes and inflation. The increase in infrastructure costs was due to the roll out of MyMagic+. In addition, other operating expenses increased driven by higher volumes.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $104 million from $1,960 million to $1,856 million due to the absence of development costs for MyMagic+, partially offset by higher marketing and sales costs and higher pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. In fiscal 2014, costs for MyMagic+ were included in operating expenses as MyMagic+ has been made available to guests. Higher marketing and sales costs were driven by marketing for new guest offerings.

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to MyMagic+.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 20%, or $443 million, to $2,663 million due to growth at our domestic operations, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris.

Studio Entertainment

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

40
Revenues

The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the performance of Frozen in fiscal 2014. The benefit of three Marvel titles and Maleficent in fiscal 2014 was essentially offset by one Marvel title, the animated titles Monsters University and Wreck-It Ralph, and Oz The Great And Powerful in fiscal 2013.

Growth in home entertainment revenue reflected a 13% increase from higher unit sales and a 9% increase from higher average net effective pricing. Growth in unit sales was due to sales of new releases reflecting the performance of Frozen. Higher pricing was primarily due to an increase in the fiscal 2014 sales mix of new releases, which have a higher relative sales price compared to catalog titles. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. Other significant titles in release included Monsters University, Marvel’s Thor: The Dark World, Planes and Marvel’s Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier in fiscal 2014 compared to Brave, Wreck-It Ralph, Marvel’s Iron Man 3, Oz The Great And Powerful and Marvel’s The Avengers in fiscal 2013.

Higher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue reflected an increase of 16% from other revenues due to an increase at Lucasfilm’s special effects business driven by higher volume and inclusion of a full year of results (Lucasfilm was acquired in December 2012), higher stage play revenues due to more productions in fiscal 2014 and higher music distribution revenues reflecting the success of the Frozen soundtrack.

Cost and Expenses

Operating expenses include a decrease of $4 million in film cost amortization, from $1,806 million to $1,802 million, driven by a lower average amortization rate due to the success of Frozen compared to titles in fiscal 2013, which was essentially offset by the impact of higher revenues. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold, which increased $129 million, from $1,206 million to $1,335 million. The increase was driven by higher revenues from Lucasfilm’s special effects business, more stage play productions and increased music sales, partially offset by a decrease at home entertainment. Lower home entertainment distribution costs and cost of goods sold were primarily due to lower average per unit costs, which included the benefit of cost saving initiatives, partially offset by an increase in units sold.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $311 million from $2,145 million to $2,456 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by more titles in wide release.

The decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to lower amortization of intangible assets.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased $888 million to $1,549 million due to increases in home entertainment and theatrical distribution.

Consumer Products

Operating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

The 13% increase in licensing and publishing revenues was due to a 12% increase from our merchandise licensing business driven by performance of merchandise based on Frozen, Disney Channel, Mickey and Minnie, Planes and Spider-Man, partially offset by lower earned revenue from Cars and Monsters merchandise.

41
The 11% increase in retail and other revenue was due to comparable store retail sales growth in our key markets, higher online sales in North America and Europe and a new wholesale distribution business in North America, which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. These increases were partially offset by a decrease from store closures in Europe.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include an increase of $39 million in cost of goods sold, from $641 million to $680 million, due to higher sales at our retail business including the wholesale distribution business in North America. Operating expenses also include labor, distribution and occupancy costs, which increased $60 million from $810 million to $870 million. The increase was primarily due to higher third-party royalty expense at our merchandise licensing business and higher labor and distribution costs at our retail business.

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $47 million from $731 million to $778 million driven by higher labor costs and higher technology development costs. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by a full period of intangible asset amortization related to Lucasfilm.

Segment Operating Income

Segment operating income increased 22% to $1,356 million due to increases at our merchandise licensing and retail businesses.

Interactive

Operating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Games revenues grew $244 million from $812 million to $1,056 million due to increases of 24% from sales of console games and 10% from mobile games. The increase in sales of console games was due to the success of the Disney Infinity franchise, partially offset by the performance of Epic Mickey 2 in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 benefited from the launch of Disney Infinity 2.0 on September 23, 2014 and higher sales of Disney Infinity 1.0, which was launched on August 18, 2013. The increase in mobile games revenue was driven by performance of Tsum Tsum and Frozen Free Fall, partially offset by a decrease as a result of discontinued games.

Revenue from other content decreased $9 million from $252 million to $243 million primarily due to the expiration of a distribution contract in fiscal 2014 and lower online advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our mobile phone business in Japan. The increase in revenue at our mobile phone business in Japan was due to higher handset sales.

Costs and Expenses

Operating expenses include an $86 million increase in cost of sales from $332 million to $418 million, partially offset by a $44 million decrease in product development from $326 million to $282 million. The increase in cost of sales was due to higher Disney Infinity sales volume, partially offset by fewer units sold of other titles. Lower product development costs reflected fewer titles in development and the benefit of restructuring activities. 

The decrease in depreciation and amortization was driven by lower amortization of intangible assets.

42
Segment Operating Income/(Loss)

Segment operating results improved from a loss of $87 million to income of $116 million due to growth at our games business and higher licensing fees from our mobile phone business in Japan.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2015 increased $32 million from fiscal 2014 due to higher labor costs. 

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2014 increased $80 million from fiscal 2013 due to higher incentive compensation costs and charitable contributions.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS 

Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately 40% of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $457 million, $309 million and $698 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2015 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of yield curves constructed from a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.

In fiscal 2016, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease by $137 million to approximately $320 million. The decrease is primarily due to a change in our approach to measuring service and interest costs. For fiscal 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For fiscal 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations nor the funded status of our plans. 

In fiscal 2015, the underfunded status of our plans increased from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion and the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense increased to $3.9 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) from $3.5 billion ($2.2 billion after tax) as the actual return on plan assets was below our assumed long-term rate of return. If our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, a significant portion of the unrecognized expense will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 9 years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements.

During fiscal 2015, the Company contributed $385 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2016 to total approximately $900 million to $950 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2016 will be determined based on our January 1, 2016 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available in late fiscal 2016. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPEMENTS

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

The Company has a foreign exchange risk management program that is intended to reduce earnings fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts designed to hedge projected foreign currency denominated operating income exposures for periods that generally do not exceed four years and to hedge foreign currency denominated net monetary assets to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of these assets from foreign currency fluctuations. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. Based on our hedge portfolio and our projections of foreign currency exposure, we project an adverse impact to growth in segment operating results from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 of approximately $500 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies in which we transact.

Segment Information

On June 29, 2015, the Company announced the combination of its Consumer Products and Interactive segments into one segment, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. The Company will begin reporting the combined segment at the beginning of fiscal 2016.

Seven TV Investment

The Company has a 49% ownership interest in Seven TV, which operates an advertising-supported, free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia. In October 2014, regulations were adopted in Russia that prohibit more than 20% foreign ownership of media companies. The regulations become effective in January 2016. The Company is in the process of restructuring its investment in a way that we believe will comply with these regulations. We understand that the Russian government will review the new structure for compliance during calendar year 2016 and, depending on the outcome, we could have an impairment of some or all of our approximately $300 million investment related to the Disney Channel in Russia. The Company’s share of the financial results of Seven TV is reported as “Equity in the income of investees” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 increased 12% or $1.1 billion to $10.9 billion compared to fiscal 2014 driven by higher operating cash flow at our Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments, partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid. Higher operating cash flow at Media Networks was due to increased operating receipts driven by affiliate fee growth, partially offset by higher disbursements for operating expenses and sports programming costs. The increase in payments for sports programming costs was primarily due to college football, partially offset by the impact of a change in payment terms for certain sports rights in fiscal 2014. Studio Entertainment cash flow benefited from lower operating cash disbursements driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing expense.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014 increased 3% or $0.3 billion to $9.8 billion compared to fiscal 2013. The increase reflected higher operating cash receipts from increased revenues across all of our segments, partially offset by higher income tax payments, higher cash payments due to new contractual payment terms for sports rights, higher programming and production spending at Media Networks and Studio Entertainment and higher payments at Parks and Resorts. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was due to labor cost inflation and increased spending on new guest offerings. Operating cash flows also benefited from the absence of the Celador litigation payment made in fiscal 2013 and lower pension contributions.

Film and Television Costs

The Company’s Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company’s broadcast, cable networks and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.

45
The Company’s film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investing Activities

Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in both fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due to higher construction spending for the Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was driven by spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort.

Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.

Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment.

46
The Company currently expects its fiscal 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.8 billion higher than fiscal 2015 capital expenditures of $4.3 billion due to increased investment at our domestic parks and resorts.

Other Investing Activities

During fiscal 2015, contributions to joint ventures totaled $151 million and proceeds from the sale of investments and dispositions totaled $166 million.

During fiscal 2014, acquisitions totaled $402 million due to the acquisition of Maker Studios and proceeds from the sales of investments and dispositions totaled $395 million.

During fiscal 2013, acquisitions totaled $2.4 billion driven by the acquisition of Lucasfilm. Proceeds from dispositions totaled $479 million primarily due to the sale of our 50% equity interest in ESS.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014. The net use of cash in the current year was due to $6.1 billion of common stock repurchases and $3.1 billion in dividends, partially offset by cash inflows associated with net borrowings of $2.7 billion and contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $1.0 billion. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities of $1.2 billion versus the prior fiscal year was due to higher net borrowings and contributions from noncontrolling interest holders, partially offset by increased dividends.

Cash used in financing activities was $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013. The net use of cash in fiscal 2014 was due to repurchases of common stock of $6.5 billion and dividends of $1.5 billion, partially offset by cash inflows associated with equity compensation awards of $0.7 billion, net borrowings of $0.6 billion and contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.6 billion. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $2.5 billion versus fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock.

During the year ended October 3, 2015, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.

(2) The other activity in foreign currency denominated debt includes the conversion of $107 million of debt into Hong Kong Disneyland Resort equity. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

The Company’s bank facilities as of October 3, 2015 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All of the above bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread depending on the credit default swap spread applicable to the Company’s debt, subject to a cap and floor that vary with the Company’s debt rating assigned by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. The spread above LIBOR can range from 0.23% to 1.63%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in March 2019, which if utilized, 

47
reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of October 3, 2015, $187 million of letters of credit were outstanding of which none were issued under this facility. 

The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.

The Company paid the following dividends in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During fiscal 2015, the Company repurchased 60 million shares of its common stock for $6.1 billion. During fiscal 2014, the Company repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock for $6.5 billion. During fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased 71 million shares of its common stock for $4.1 billion. As of October 3, 2015, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 355 million additional shares. 

We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors”. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company’s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of October 3, 2015, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard & Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 3, 2015, by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the International Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.

48
The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at October 3, 2015 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $131 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. Amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. In 2023, the Company has the ability to call a debt instrument prior to its scheduled maturity, which if exercised by the Company would reduce future interest payments by $1.1 billion.

(2)Other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.

(3)Contractual commitments include the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees

At October 3, 2015, the Company has a $96 million liability for the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Maker Studios, Inc. See Notes 3, 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.

Legal and Tax Matters

As disclosed in Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Film and Television Revenues and Costs

We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the 

49
initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.

With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.

With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the program’s rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company’s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.

We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program’s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.

Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company’s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.

Revenue Recognition

The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.

We reduce home entertainment and game revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or concessions exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.

We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. We recognize revenues from expiring multi-use tickets ratably over the estimated usage period. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a five-year time period based on estimated usage. The estimated usage periods are derived from historical usage patterns. 

50
If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions

The Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 4.47% at the end of fiscal 2015 from 4.40% at the end of fiscal 2014 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2015 year end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately $230 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 3, 2015 by approximately $2.5 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $223 million and $2.1 billion, respectively.

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2016 annual benefit expense by approximately $105 million.

At the end of fiscal 2015, we changed the approach we will use in fiscal 2016 to determine the service and interest cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.

To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.

In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.

The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest 

51
level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.

The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.

The Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $10 million, $46 million and $5 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The fiscal 2014 impairment charges related to radio FCC licenses held by businesses in the Media Networks segment. The fair values of the radio FCC licenses were derived from market transactions. These impairment charges were recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.

Contingencies and Litigation

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.

Income Tax Audits

As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.

New Accounting Pronouncements

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These 

52
statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K.
