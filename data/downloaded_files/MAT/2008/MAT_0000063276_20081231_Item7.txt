Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  

Overview  

Mattels objective is to continue to create long-term shareholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established three overarching goals.  

The first goal is to enhance innovation in order to reinvigorate the Barbie® brand, while maintaining growth in other core brands by continuing to develop popular toys. Additionally, Mattel plans to pursue additional licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to extend its portfolio of brands into areas outside of traditional toys.  

The second goal is to improve execution in areas including manufacturing, distribution, and selling. Mattel continues to focus on improving the efficiency of its supply chain using Lean supply chain initiatives. The objective of the Lean program is to improve the flow of processes, do more with less, and focus on the value chain from beginning to end.  

The third goal is to further capitalize on Mattels scale advantage. For example, as the worlds largest toy company, Mattel believes it can realize cost savings when making purchasing decisions based on a One Mattel philosophy.  

2008 Overview  

The toy industry was not immune to the downturn in the global economy. Consumer confidence reached an all-time low in December of 2008, driving retail sales weakness in the fourth quarter as consumers, fearful of the economys direction, cut back their discretionary spending. Toy retailers and manufacturers were impacted by the economic downturn, with estimates of more than one thousand Chinese toy manufacturers closing their operations and significant toy sellers in the US, UK, Mexico, and other major markets closing their operations or entering bankruptcy. Against the backdrop of the broader economic and industry trends, Mattel underperformed for the quarter, and ultimately the year, due to a combination of lackluster sales, lower gross margins, and higher expenses:  

       Mattels net sales declined 1 percent for the year, driven by an 11 percent decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of 2008. Mattel experienced sales shortfalls across most of its brands and throughout many of the countries in which it operates, with sales declines in the International segment for the first time since the year 2000. The decrease in sales was primarily attributable to the macro economic trends discussed above.  

       Mattels gross margin rate declined in 2008 primarily because price increases implemented in June 2008 did not anticipate the record high product input costs Mattel experienced during its peak production period last summer.  

       Other selling and administrative expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to incremental legal costs, settlements, and severance charges.  

Mattel did make progress in 2008 in a number of important areas. During 2008, American Girl® achieved record revenues despite the difficult economic environment; in Mattels litigation with MGA Entertainment, Inc., a unanimous jury verdict was rendered against MGA and its Chief Executive Officer; and Mattel was awarded new toy licenses for the WWE® Wrestling, Disney/Pixars Toy Story, and HIT Entertainments Thomas and Friends, which will help Mattel grow in 2010 and beyond.

2009 and Beyond  

Management expects the unfavorable economic conditions experienced in 2008 to continue into 2009. Management also expects Mattels revenues to be under pressure in 2009 as a result of retail softness driven by a continued pull-back in consumers willingness to spend and retailers desire to reduce inventories, weakening foreign exchange in international markets, and fewer entertainment-related products in 2009. As a result, Mattel is managing its business based on realistic revenue assumptions and taking actions intended to improve profitability and strengthen its balance sheet:  

       A modest price increase for Mattels spring 2009 product line was initiated in 2008;  

       Mattel continues to renegotiate product costs with vendors;  

       Mattel is evaluating reductions to the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) it offers;  

       Mattel is reassessing its advertising spending and strategy with the expectation that 2009 advertising expense will be at the low end of its historical range of 11 to 13 percent; and  

       Mattel initiated its Global Cost Leadership Program in 2008, which includes a global reduction in its professional workforce of approximately 1,000 people implemented in November 2008, a coordinated efficiency strategic plan that includes structural changes designed to lower costs and improve efficiencies, and additional procurement initiatives designed to fully leverage Mattels global scale. This program is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $100 million of net cost savings in 2009, and approximately $180 million to $200 million of cumulative net cost savings by the end of 2010.  

Management expects to focus on profitability and margins and conserve cash in 2009. As a result, Mattel is planning to tightly manage its capital expenditures in 2009 to a level that is more consistent with its levels of capital expenditures in 2003 through 2007. In addition, given the current volatile global economic environment, Mattel is prioritizing protecting Mattels dividend to shareholders and minimizing strategic acquisitions and share repurchases in 2009.  

Results of Operations  

2008 Compared to 2007  

Consolidated Results  

Net sales for 2008 were $5.92 billion, a 1% decrease as compared to $5.97 billion in 2007, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2008 was $379.6 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $600.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, for 2007. Net income for 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits of $42.0 million as a result of reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes.  

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 45.4% in 2008 from 46.5% in 2007. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to higher product costs driven by higher commodities, labor, and product testing costs, along with appreciating Asian currencies (collectively, input costs), higher costs of distribution, and mix, partially offset by the benefit of price increases, favorable changes in currency exchange rates, and lower product recall costs as compared to 2007.  

Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales declined to 8.2% in 2008 from 11.8% in 2007. Contributing to this decline were lower gross margins, higher advertising and promotion expenses, and higher other selling and administrative expenses, which were all impacted by lower sales. The increase in other selling and administrative expense in 2008 was primarily due to incremental legal and settlement related costs of approximately $52 million, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher bad debt expense. Additionally, interest expense increased in 2008 due to higher average borrowings, partially offset by lower average interest rates and interest income decreased in 2008 due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses  

Advertising and promotion expenses increased to 12.2% of net sales in 2008, from 11.9% in 2007 due primarily to lower than expected sales volume.  

Other Selling and Administrative Expenses  

Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.42 billion in 2008, or 24.1% of net sales, as compared to $1.34 billion in 2007, or 22.4% of net sales.

2007 Compared to 2006  

Consolidated Results  

Net sales for 2007 were $5.97 billion, a 6% increase as compared to $5.65 billion in 2006, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2007 was $600.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $592.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, for 2006.  

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 46.5% in 2007 from 46.2% in 2006. The increase in gross profit was driven by price increases and favorable changes in currency exchange rates, which were partially offset by external cost pressures and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which reduced gross profit by approximately $71 million.  

Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales declined to 11.8% in 2007 from 12.1% in 2006. Contributing to this decline were higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and higher advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher gross margins, lower interest expense, and higher other non-operating income. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses in 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased other selling and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million. Higher investments in the business, including design and development costs and expansion in international markets, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increases in employee-related costs, and the inclusion of Radica® costs also contributed to the increase. These costs increases were partially offset by lower 2007 incentive and equity compensation expenses. Other selling and administrative expenses in 2006 included $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors. Other non-operating income, net increased from $4.3 million in 2006 to $11.0 million in 2007, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains.  

Net income in 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million due to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes. Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May 2006 and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of multiple ongoing audits by foreign and state tax authorities.

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.5% in 2007, as compared to 46.2% in 2006. The improvement in gross profit was primarily driven by the alignment of prices with increased input costs and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by external cost pressures and an 80 basis point negative impact from the 2007 Product Recalls.  

Advertising and Promotion Expenses  

Advertising and promotion expenses increased to 11.9% of net sales in 2007, from 11.5% in 2006 due primarily to additional media and promotion to drive consumer demand at retail. Also, the 2007 Product Recalls increased advertising and promotion expenses by approximately $5 million.

Domestic Segment  

Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US gross sales decreased 4% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Within this segment, gross sales of Barbie® products decreased 15%, primarily driven by sales declines of Barbie® Fantasy and My Scene® products, partially offset by higher sales of Barbie® Collector products. Gross sales of Other Girls Brands decreased 3%, primarily driven by sales declines in Polly Pocket® and Pixel Chix®, partially offset by strong sales of High School Musical and Little Mommy® products. Gross sales of Wheels products increased 2%, primarily due to sales increases in Matchbox®, partially offset by lower sales of Tyco R/C® products. Gross sales in Entertainment products, which includes games and puzzles and Radica®, increased 1%, primarily driven by the continued strong sales of CARS products and the inclusion of Radica® sales, partially offset by sales declines in Superman® products. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US segment income decreased 21% to $212.2 million in 2007, primarily due to lower sales volume, higher other selling and administrative expenses, and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which lowered Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US segment income by approximately $12 million.  

Fisher-Price Brands US gross sales increased 3%, reflecting an increase in sales of Core Fisher-Price® products, partially offset by sales declines of Fisher-Price® Friends products. Sales increases in Core Fisher-Price® products reflected strong sales of learning, infant, BabyGear, and preschool products. Sales declines of Fisher-Price® Friends products were primarily due to some properties declining from strong 2006 levels, partially offset by higher Sesame Street® sales during 2007. Fisher-Price Brands US segment income increased 4% to $225.5 million in 2007, primarily due to higher sales volume and improved gross profit resulting from price increases and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expenses and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which decreased Fisher-Price Brands US segment operating income by approximately $30 million.  

American Girl Brands gross sales decreased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to the continued softness in the direct channel and lower sales of established historical characters, partially offset by strong sales of the Girl of the Year®, Nicki®, the launch of the newest historical character, Julie®, and sales from the American Girl Boutique and Bistro® retail stores which opened in Atlanta, Georgia in August 2007 and Dallas, Texas in November 2007.

Gross sales of Barbie® increased 12%, including an 8 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily due to higher sales of Barbie® Reality and Barbie® Collector products. Gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 4%, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by increased sales of Little Mommy® and Polly Pocket®, partially offset by declines in Winx Club® and Pixel Chix®. Gross sales of Wheels products grew by 24%, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, reflecting growth in Hot Wheels® and Matchbox®. Gross sales of Entertainment products increased by 31%, including a 9 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by strong sales of CARS products and the inclusion of Radica® sales, partially offset by sales declines of Superman® products. Fisher-Price Brands gross sales increased 17%, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, due to higher sales of Core Fisher-Price® products, primarily infant, preschool, BabyGear, newborn, and learning products, partially offset by sales declines of Fisher-Price® Friends products. International segment income was relatively flat with prior year at $420.9 million, primarily due to increased sales volume, offset by higher other selling and administrative expenses and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which decreased International segment operating income by approximately $47 million.  

Global Cost Leadership Program  

During the middle of 2008, Mattel initiated its Global Cost Leadership program, which is designed to improve operating efficiencies and leverage Mattels global scale to improve profitability and operating cash flows. Mattels Global Cost Leadership program is intended to generate approximately $90 million to $100 million of net cost savings in 2009, and approximately $180 million to $200 million of cumulative net cost savings by the end of 2010. The major initiatives included in Mattels Global Cost Leadership program include:  

       A global reduction in Mattels professional workforce of approximately 1,000 people that was implemented in November 2008.  

       A coordinated efficiency strategic plan that includes structural changes designed to lower costs and improve efficiencies; for example, offshoring and outsourcing certain back office functions, and more clustering of management for international markets.  

       Additional procurement initiatives designed to fully leverage Mattels global scale in areas such as creative agency partnerships, legal services, and distribution, including ocean carriers and over-the-road freight vendors.  

The workforce reduction is expected to generate approximately $60 million in annualized compensation- related savings. In connection with the workforce reduction, Mattel recorded severance and other termination-related charges in 2008 of approximately $34 million.

Income Taxes  

Mattels effective tax rate on income before income taxes in 2008 was 22.2% as compared to 14.7% in 2007. The 2007 income tax provision includes net benefits of $42.0 million related to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes.  

The 2006 income tax provision includes a benefit of $63.0 million related to settlements with foreign and state tax authorities. Of the total benefit recorded in 2006, $57.5 million represents refunds of previously paid taxes, recorded as an expense in previous years. These refunds were recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period the refunds were received by Mattel. The balance of the tax benefit recorded in 2006 was a net reduction to total income tax reserves resulting from tax settlements with foreign and state tax authorities.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Mattels primary sources of liquidity are its cash and equivalents balances, access to short-term borrowing facilities, and issuances of long-term debt securities. Cash flows from operating activities could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for Mattels products, which could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions and changes in public and consumer preferences, or by increased costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of products or shortages in raw materials or component parts. Additionally, Mattels ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as the current global economic crisis and tight credit environment, an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements, which include maintaining consolidated debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios, or a deterioration of Mattels credit ratings. Mattels ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity.  

Current Market Conditions  

Mattel is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates, and recent developments in the financial markets have increased Mattels exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties. Mattel believes that it has ample liquidity to fund its business needs, including beginning of the year cash and equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to its $1.3 billion domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility, which it uses for seasonal working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2008, Mattel had available incremental borrowing resources totaling approximately $1.0 billion under this unsecured committed revolving credit facility, and Mattel has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access this source of liquidity. Mattels domestic credit facility expires on March 23, 2010, and market conditions could affect the size and certain terms of the replacement facility along with terms of other debt instruments that Mattel enters into from time to time.  

Mattel monitors the third-party depository institutions that hold the companys cash and equivalents. Mattels emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing the yield on those funds. Mattel diversifies its cash and equivalents among counterparties and securities to minimize exposure. As of December 31, 2008, Mattel had a money market investment with an original cost basis of $85.3 million, which was reclassified from cash and equivalents to other current assets as a result of the money market investment fund halting redemption requests in September 2008. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2008, Mattel recorded a $4.0 million non-operating loss to recognize the estimated impairment of underlying securities associated with this investment. In January 2009, Mattel received proceeds of approximately $55 million related to this investment, and expects to receive the remaining proceeds, net of the impairment charge, by the end of 2009, when the underlying securities will have matured. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, Mattel also had additional long-term investments of $35.0 million.  

Mattel is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations. The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered

 in the fair value measurements of Mattels foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. Mattel continues to closely monitor its counterparties and will take action, as appropriate, to further manage its counterparty credit risk.  

Mattel expects that some of its customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials. Mattel monitors its customers financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate Mattels accounts receivable collectibility risks. During 2008, bad debt expense increased by approximately $13 million as compared to 2007 as a result of certain customers facing financial difficulties.  

Mattel sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for employees of the company. In 2008, actual returns for Mattels defined benefit pension plans were below the expected rate of return due to adverse conditions in the equity and debt markets. Continued actual returns below the expected rate of return, along with changes in interest rates that affect the measurement of the liability, would impact the amount and timing of Mattels future contributions to these plans.  

Capital and Investment Framework  

To guide future capital deployment decisions, with a goal of maximizing shareholder value, Mattels Board of Directors in 2003 established the following capital and investment framework:  

       To maintain approximately $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash available to fund a substantial portion of seasonal working capital;  

       To maintain a year-end debt-to-capital ratio of about 25%;  

       To invest approximately $180 million to $200 million in capital expenditures annually to maintain and grow the business;  

       To make strategic acquisitions consistent with Mattels vision of providing the worlds premier toy brandstoday and tomorrow; and  

       To return excess funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  

Mattels focus for 2009 is on strengthening its balance sheet and managing costs in line with realistic revenues with the goal of improving the profitability and cash flows generated by its business. Management expects to conserve cash and lower debt to strengthen its balance sheet in the near-term. Given the current volatile global economic environment, Mattel is prioritizing protecting its dividend to shareholders and minimizing strategic acquisitions and share repurchases in 2009.  

Over the long-term, after the full impact of the current economic and financial crisis is understood and assuming cash flows from operating activities remain strong, Mattel plans to use its free cash flows to invest in strategic acquisitions and to return funds to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. Mattels share repurchase program has no expiration date and repurchases will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. The ability to implement successfully the capital deployment plan is directly dependent on Mattels ability to generate strong cash flows from operating activities. There is no assurance that Mattel will continue to generate strong cash flows from operating activities or achieve its targeted goals from investing activities.  

Operating Activities  

Cash flows generated from operating activities were $436.3 million during 2008, as compared to $560.5 million in 2007, and $875.9 million in 2006. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2008 from 2007 was primarily the result of lower profitability, partially offset by lower working capital requirements, mainly due to lower usage of cash to reduce levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2007 from 2006 was primarily the result of higher working capital requirements, mainly due to lower sales of receivables, the timing of vendor payments, and lower accruals for incentive and royalty obligations. 

37  

Table of Contents 

Investing Activities  

Cash flows used for investing activities were $311.7 million during 2008, primarily due to the purchase of property, plant and equipment and tools, dies, and molds, an increase in other investments (included within current assets), and acquisitions totaling $58.4 million for the intellectual property rights related to Whac-a-Mole® and the acquisition of Sekkoia SAS, which owns the Blokus® trademark and trade name rights. Cash flows used for investing activities were higher in 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly due to other investments and higher purchases of property, plant, and equipment and tools, dies, and molds, partially offset by lower payments for businesses acquired. Cash flows used for investing activities were lower in 2007 as compared to 2006 mainly due to lower payments for businesses acquired, partially offset by the purchase of a long-term investment security, higher purchases of other property, plant, and equipment, and lower proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. 

Financing Activities   

Cash flows used for financing activities decreased to $395.7 million in 2008 from $587.8 million in 2007 primarily as a result of lower share repurchases, partially offset by lower net borrowings and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash flows used for financing activities increased to $587.8 million in 2007 from $374.1 million in 2006 as a result of higher share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and higher net borrowings.  

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Board of Directors authorized Mattel to increase its share repurchase program by $500.0 million, $750.0 million, and $250.0 million, respectively. During 2008, Mattel repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of $90.6 million. During 2007, Mattel repurchased 35.9 million shares at a cost of $806.3 million. During 2006, Mattel repurchased 11.8 million shares at a cost of $192.7 million. At December 31, 2008, share repurchase authorizations of $410.3 million had not been executed. Repurchases will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. Mattels share repurchase program has no expiration date.  

In 2008 and 2007, Mattel paid a dividend per share of $0.75 to holders of its common stock. In 2006, Mattel paid a dividend per share of $0.65 to holders of its common stock. The Board of Directors declared the dividends in November, and Mattel paid the dividends in December of each year. The dividend payments were $268.9 million, $272.3 million, and $249.5 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.  

Seasonal Financing  

See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 8 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSeasonal Financing and Debt.  

Financial Position  

Mattels cash and equivalents were $617.7 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $283.5 million from 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by net repayments of $342.9 million of short-term borrowings, dividend payments of $268.9 million, $198.8 million of purchases of tools, dies, and molds, and other property, plant, and equipment, share repurchases of $90.6 million, increase in other investments of $85.3 million, and acquisitions totaling $58.4 million for the intellectual property rights relating to Whac-a-mole® and the acquisition of Sekkoia SAS, partially offset by cash flows generated from operating activities of $436.3 million and $350.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2008 Senior Notes in March 2008.  

Accounts receivable decreased $117.7 million, reflecting lower fourth quarter sales, partially offset by lower factored receivables.  

38  

Table of Contents 

Inventories increased $57.2 million, reflecting higher input costs during the year, earlier production to meet supply chain requirements, including longer lead times for certain international markets, and lower fourth quarter sales.  

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $83.2 million from December 31, 2007 to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the timing and amount of payments of various accrued liability balances, including incentive compensation, royalties, and advertising obligations.  

Short-term borrowings include borrowings under the foreign and domestic unsecured committed credit facilities. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Mattels total short-term borrowings total $0 and $349.0 million, respectively. The current portion of long-term debt increased $100.0 million to $150.0 million at December 31, 2008, as compared to December 31, 2007 due to the reclassification of $100.0 million of the 2006 Senior Notes and $50.0 million of Medium-term notes to current, partially offset by Medium-term notes repayments of $50.0 million.  

A summary of Mattels capitalization is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total noncurrent long-term debt increased $200.0 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007, due to the $350.0 million issuance of 2008 Senior Notes, all of which was classified as noncurrent at December 31, 2008, partially offset by the reclassification of $100.0 million of the 2006 Senior Notes and $50.0 million of Medium-term notes to current. Mattel expects to satisfy its future long-term capital needs through the generation of corporate earnings and issuance of long-term debt instruments, as needed. Other noncurrent liabilities increased $169.6 million at December 31, 2008, as compared to December 31, 2007, due primarily to increases in long-term defined benefit pension plan obligations. Stockholders equity of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008 decreased by $189.6 million from December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of payment of the annual dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of 2008, unfavorable currency translation adjustments, an increase in Mattels net defined benefit pension plan obligations, and share repurchases, partially offset by net income.  

Mattels debt-to-capital ratio, including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt, increased to 29.8% at December 31, 2008 from 29.1% at December 31, 2007, due to the aforementioned decrease in stockholders equity, partially offset by the decrease in debt. Mattels objective is to maintain a year-end debt-to-capital ratio of approximately 25%.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Mattel has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Commitments  

In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into debt agreements, contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattels right to create and market certain products, and for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery. These arrangements include commitments for future inventory purchases and royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the term of the contracts.

 * Represents total obligation, including imputed interest of $1.1 million.  

In connection with the 2007 adoption of FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which a cash tax payment is not expected to be made in the next twelve months were reclassified from income taxes payable (within current liabilities) to other noncurrent liabilities. Due to the uncertainty about the periods in which examinations will be completed and limited information related to current audits, Mattel is not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods in which cash settlements will occur with taxing authorities for the noncurrent liabilities.  

Litigation  

The content of Note 12 (Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mattel in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety in this Item 7.  

Derivative Litigation  

A consolidated stockholder derivative action is pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court in California, captioned In re Mattel, Inc. Derivative Litigation, consolidating three derivative actions filed in September 2007 (the Superior Court Action), asserting claims ostensibly on behalf and for the benefit of Mattel. A second consolidated derivative action in US District Court, Central District of California, captioned In re Mattel, Inc. Derivative Litigation, consolidating three federal derivative actions filed in October 2007, asserting claims ostensibly on behalf and for the benefit of Mattel, was dismissed with prejudice by the federal court in August 2008. Another derivative action, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware in October 2007, has been voluntarily dismissed.  

The Superior Court Action alleges that past and present members of Mattels Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with product safety and reporting practices allegedly related to Mattels product recalls during August and September 2007. Plaintiffs also sue certain executive officers of Mattel, and allege that certain officers and current and former directors who sold stock during the first half of 2007 breached   

40  

Table of Contents 

 their fiduciary duties by selling while allegedly in possession of non-public information relating to alleged product defects and seek disgorgement of unspecified amounts of profits from such sales. Defendants filed a demurrer to the entire complaint on August 27, 2008, which was sustained with leave to amend on December 22, 2008. Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Consolidated Complaint on January 20, 2009, and the date for responses to that amended complaint has not yet arrived.  

Effects of Inflation  

Inflation rates in the US and in major foreign countries where Mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during 2008, 2007, or 2006. Mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability under certain circumstances at certain times to pass on higher prices to its customers.  

Employee Savings Plan  

Mattel sponsors a 401(k) savings plan, the Mattel, Inc. Personal Investment Plan (the Plan), for its domestic employees. Contributions to the Plan include voluntary contributions by eligible employees and employer automatic and matching contributions by Mattel. The Plan allows employees to allocate both their voluntary contributions and their employer automatic and matching contributions to a variety of investment funds, including a fund that is fully invested in Mattel common stock (the Mattel Stock Fund). Employees are not required to allocate any of their Plan account balance to the Mattel Stock Fund, which allows employees to limit or eliminate their exposure to market changes in Mattels stock price. Furthermore, the Plan limits the percentage of the employees total account balance that may be allocated to the Mattel Stock Fund to 25%. Employees may generally reallocate their account balances on a daily basis. However, pursuant to Mattels insider trading policy, employees classified as insiders and restricted personnel under Mattels insider trading policy are limited to certain periods in which they may make allocations into or out of the Mattel Stock Fund.  

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Mattel makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those Mattel considers most critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures included below. The following is a review of the accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. As described below, however, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used instead.  

Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of Mattels significant accounting policies, estimates, and methods used in the preparation of Mattels consolidated financial statements. In most instances, Mattel must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.  

Accounts ReceivableAllowance for Doubtful Accounts  

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including other selling and administrative expenses, net income, and accounts receivable. In addition, the allowance requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors in relation to its customers ability to pay amounts owed to Mattel.  

41  

Table of Contents 

Mattels products are sold throughout the world. Products within the Domestic segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets and, to a limited extent, wholesalers, and directly to consumers. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence.  

In recent years, the mass-market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. In addition, many of Mattels customers have been negatively impacted by worsening economic conditions. Certain of Mattels customers filed for bankruptcy in 2008, including KB Toys in the US and Woolworths in the UK, and the recent global economic crisis has adversely affected the financial position of other retailers. Mattels sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral and are highly concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to the cyclical nature of toy sales, which results in a substantial portion of trade receivables being collected during the latter half of the year and the first quarter of the following year. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of Mattel. This could increase Mattels exposure to losses from bad debts.  

A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattels net sales and accounts receivable. In 2008, Mattels three largest customers, Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, and Target, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 38% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 47% of net sales. As of December 31, 2008, Mattels three largest customers accounted for approximately 32% of net accounts receivable, and its ten largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of net accounts receivable. The concentration of Mattels business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattels large customers were to experience financial difficulty.  

Mattel has procedures to mitigate its risk of exposure to losses from bad debts. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or upon receipt of products by the customer, depending on the terms, provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an agreement exists documenting the specific terms of the transaction; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectibility must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer. Extensive evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of each customers financial performance, cash generation, financing availability and liquidity status. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews being performed, if necessary, based on the customers financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit. Customer terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the results of the review. Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, factoring or purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.  

The following table summarizes Mattels allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mattels allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the business environment, customers financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts between December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflect managements assessment of the factors noted above, including past due accounts, disputed balances with customers, and the financial condition of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.  

42  

Table of Contents 

Mattel believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2008 is adequate and proper. However, as described above, Mattels business is greatly dependent on a small number of customers. Should one or more of Mattels major customers experience liquidity problems, then the allowance for doubtful accounts of $25.9 million, or 2.9% of accounts receivable, at December 31, 2008 may not be sufficient to cover such losses. Any incremental bad debt charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattels business segments.  

InventoriesAllowance for Obsolescence  

Inventories, net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, net income, and inventories. As more fully described below, valuation of Mattels inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences, demand for product, or changes in the buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and inventory management of customers.  

In the toy industry, orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment since actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line, which would require management to record a valuation allowance on such inventory.  

Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research and current market information. Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, who usually request delivery within three months. In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times cause risk to Mattels business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase inventory valuation risk since Mattels inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed.  

Additionally, current conditions in the domestic and global economies are uncertain. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts of the economy, including the economies in which Mattel participates. Because all components of Mattels budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets it serves and demand for its products, the prevailing economic uncertainties make estimates of future demand for product more difficult. Such economic changes may affect the sales of Mattels products and its corresponding inventory levels, which could potentially impact the valuation of its inventory.  

At the end of each quarter, management within each business segment, Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, American Girl Brands, and International, performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item-by-item basis and identifies products that are believed to be impaired. Management assesses the need for, and the amount of, an obsolescence reserve based on the following factors:  

       Customer and/or consumer demand for the item;  

       Overall inventory positions of Mattels customers;  

       Strength of competing products in the market;  

43  

Table of Contents 

       Quantity on hand of the item;  

       Standard retail price of the item;  

       Mattels cost for the item; and  

       Length of time the item has been in inventory.  

The time frame between when an estimate is made and the time of disposal depends on the above factors and may vary significantly. Generally, slow-moving inventory is liquidated during the next annual selling cycle.  

The following table summarizes Mattels obsolescence reserve at December 31:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increases in the allowance for obsolescence from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 were mainly due to higher levels of excess inventory in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Management believes that its allowance for obsolescence at December 31, 2008 is adequate and proper. However, the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary. Any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattels business segments.  

Recoverability of Goodwill and Nonamortizable Intangible Assets  

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires companies to test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the recoverability of its goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income, goodwill, and other intangible assets.  

The recoverability of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment since the first step of the impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value. Based on the assumptions underlying the valuation, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting units book value. If the fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is not recognized. If an impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.  

For purposes of evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be allocated to various reporting units, which are either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below the operating segment. Mattels reporting units are: Mattel Girls Brands US, Mattel Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, American Girl Brands, and International. Goodwill is allocated to Mattels reporting units based on an allocation of brand-specific goodwill to the reporting units selling those brands. Mattel utilizes the fair value based upon the discounted cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future (the Income Approach) when evaluating goodwill for impairment. The Income Approach valuation method requires Mattel to make projections of revenue, operating costs and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must make an estimate of a weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. Changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step in the SFAS No. 142 impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded. As of September 30, 2008, Mattel performed the annual impairment test for

 goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142 and determined that its goodwill was not impaired since, for each of the reporting units, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. Mattel also considered events and circumstances subsequent to the annual impairment tests in concluding there was no impairment at December 31, 2008.  

Testing nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment also involves a high degree of judgment due to the assumptions that underlie the valuation. Mattel evaluates nonamortizable intangible assets, including trademarks and trade names, for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values. The fair value is measured using a multi-period royalty savings method, which reflects the savings realized by owning the trademarks and trade names, and thus not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party. As of September 30, 2008, Mattel performed the annual impairment test for nonamortizable intangible assets as required by SFAS No. 142 and determined that its nonamortizable intangible assets were not impaired. Mattel also considered events and circumstances subsequent to the annual impairment tests in concluding there was no impairment at December 31, 2008.  

Sales Adjustments  

Mattel routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized. Sales adjustments for such programs totaled $568.0 million, $622.8 million, and $507.9 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.  

The above-described programs primarily involve fixed amounts or percentages of sales to customers. Accruals for such programs are calculated based on an assessment of customers purchases and performance under the programs and any other specified factors. While the majority of sales adjustment amounts are readily determinable at period end and do not require estimates, certain of the sales adjustments require management to make estimates. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends and information from customers. Management believes that the accruals recorded for customer programs at December 31, 2008 are adequate and proper.  

Product Recalls and Withdrawals  

During 2007, Mattel recalled products with high-powered magnets that may become dislodged and other products, some of which were produced using non-approved paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory and Mattel standards. During the second half of 2007, additional products were recalled, withdrawn from retail stores, or replaced at the request of consumers as a result of safety or quality issues (collectively, the 2007 Product Recalls). In the second quarter of 2008, Mattel determined that certain products had been shipped into foreign markets in which the products did not meet all applicable regulatory standards for those markets. None of these deficiencies related to lead or magnets. Mattel withdrew these products from retail stores in these markets and, although not required to do so, also withdrew the products from the US and other markets because they did not meet Mattels internal standards (the 2008 Product Withdrawal).  

Mattel establishes a reserve for product recalls and withdrawals on a product-specific basis when circumstances giving rise to the recall or withdrawal become known. Facts and circumstances related to the recall or withdrawal, including where the product affected by the recall or withdrawal is located (e.g., with consumers, in customers inventory, or in Mattels inventory), cost estimates for shipping and handling for returns, whether the product is repairable, cost estimates for communicating the recall or withdrawal to consumers and customers, and cost estimates for parts and labor if the recalled or withdrawn product is deemed to be repairable, are considered when establishing a product recall or withdrawal reserve. These factors are updated and reevaluated each period and the related reserves are adjusted when these factors indicate that the recall or withdrawal reserve is either not sufficient to cover or exceeds the estimated product recall or withdrawal expenses.

Table of Contents 

Significant changes in the assumptions used to develop estimates for product recall or withdrawal reserves could affect key financial measures, including accounts receivable, inventory, net sales, cost of sales, other selling and administrative expenses, and net income. In addition, estimating product recall or withdrawal reserves requires a high degree of judgment in areas such as estimating the portion of recalled or withdrawn products sold to end consumers and the portion held by retailers, return rates, shipping and handling for returns, the way in which affected products held by consumers may be remediated (e.g., through redeemable vouchers, or a repair kit being provided), and the costs of meeting regulatory requirements in various countries (e.g., public notification).  

The following table summarizes Mattels reserve activity for the 2007 Product Recalls and the 2008 Product Withdrawal (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mattel believes that its reserves for the 2007 Product Recalls and 2008 Product Withdrawal at December 31, 2008 are adequate and proper. However, as described above, if the portions of inventory held at retailers and end consumers are different than estimated, or return rates and shipping and handling for returns are higher than expected, then the reserves of $4.9 million at December 31, 2008 may not be sufficient to cover such losses.  

Benefit Plan Assumptions  

As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, Mattel and certain of its subsidiaries have retirement and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees of these companies. Mattel accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, and SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and its other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 7 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsEmployee Benefit Plans.  

Actuarial valuations are used in determining amounts recognized in the financial statements for retirement and other postretirement benefit plans. These valuations incorporate the following significant assumptions:  

       Weighted average discount rate to be used to measure future plan obligations and interest cost component of plan income or expense;  

       Rate of future compensation increases (for defined benefit pension plans);  

       Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded plans); and  

       Health care cost trend rates (for other postretirement benefit plans).  

Management believes that these assumptions are critical accounting estimates because significant changes in these assumptions could impact Mattels results of operations and financial position. Management believes that the assumptions utilized to record its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on the plans experience and advice received from its outside actuaries. Mattel reviews its benefit plan assumptions annually and modifies its assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. The effects of such changes in assumptions are amortized as part of plan income or expense in future periods in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106, and 158.

Table of Contents 

At the end of each fiscal year, Mattel determines the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the benefit plan liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate also impacts the interest cost component of plan income or expense. At December 31, 2008, Mattel determined the discount rate for its domestic benefit plans used in determining the projected and accumulated benefit obligations to be 5.4% as compared to 6.2% and 5.7% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. In estimating this rate, Mattel reviews rates of return on high-quality, corporate bond indices, which approximate the timing and amount of benefit payments. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, the decrease in the discount rate from 6.2% to 5.4% will result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2009 of approximately $4.0 million.  

The rate of future compensation increases used by Mattel for the benefit obligation of its domestic defined benefit pension plans averaged 3.75% for 2008 and 2007, and 4.0% for 2006, based on plan demographics. The rate of future compensation increases used by Mattel for the net periodic pension cost of its domestic defined benefit pension plans averaged 3.75% for 2008, 4.0% for 2007, and 4.4% for 2006, based on plan demographics. These assumptions are reviewed annually based on historical salary increases for participants in the defined benefit pension plans. This assumption impacts the service and interest cost components of plan income or expense.  

The long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on managements expectation of earnings on the assets that secure Mattels funded defined benefit pension plans, taking into account the mix of invested assets, the arithmetic average of past returns, economic and stock market conditions and future expectations and the long-term nature of the projected benefit obligation to which these investments relate. The long-term rate of return is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets that is used in calculating pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred, net of tax, and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income or expense. Mattels long-term rate of return for its domestic defined benefit pension plans was 8.0% in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2009 of approximately $2.5 million.  

The health care cost trend rates used by Mattel for its other postretirement benefit plans reflect managements best estimate of expected claim costs over the next ten years. These trend rates impact the service and interest cost components of plan expense. Rates ranging from 8.0% in 2008 to 5% in 2011, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2012 and thereafter, were used in determining plan expense for 2008. These rates are reviewed annually and are estimated based on historical costs for participants in the other postretirement benefit plans as well as estimates based on current economic conditions. As of December 31, 2008, Mattel adjusted the health care cost trend rates for its other postretirement benefit plans to range from 7.0% in 2008 reducing to 5.0% in 2011, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2012 and thereafter. Assuming all other postretirement benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefit plan expense during 2009 by approximately $0.3 million.  

A one percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each future year would impact the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 by approximately $4.8 million and $(4.4) million, respectively, while a one percentage point increase/(decrease) would impact the service and interest cost recognized for 2008 by approximately $0.3 million and $(0.3) million, respectively. 

Share-Based Payments  

Mattel recognizes the cost of employee share-based payment awards on a straight-line attribution basis over the requisite employee service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In accounting for the income tax benefits associated with employee exercises of share-based payments, Mattel has elected to adopt the alternative simplified method as permitted by FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 123(R)-3, Accounting for the Tax   

47  

Table of Contents 

 Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 permits the adoption of either the transition guidance described in SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation or the alternative simplified method specified in FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 to account for the income tax effects of share-based payment awards. In determining when additional tax benefits associated with share-based payment exercises are recognized, Mattel follows the ordering of deductions under the tax law, which allows deductions for share-based payment exercises to be utilized before previously existing net operating loss carryforwards. In computing dilutive shares under the treasury stock method, Mattel does not reduce the tax benefit amount within the calculation for the amount of deferred tax assets that would have been recognized had Mattel previously expensed all share-based payment awards.  

Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the measurement date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility, and the expected dividends. The fair value of options granted has been estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of the options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattels stock for a period approximating the expected life, the expected dividend yield is based on Mattels most recent actual annual dividend payout, and the risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. Management believes that these assumptions are critical accounting estimates because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income.  

The following weighted average assumptions were used in determining the fair value of options granted:

Mattel recognized compensation expense of $9.5 million, $7.4 million, and $23.9 million for stock options during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, as a component of other selling and administrative expenses. Stock option expense in 2006 included $19.3 million related to prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors. Compensation expense recognized related to grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs) to certain employees and non-employee Board members was $26.2 million, $14.8 million, and $3.6 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and is a component of other selling and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2008, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled $69.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.  

Income Taxes  

Mattels income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual and expected future income, US and foreign statutory income tax rates, and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which Mattel operates. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the US and in foreign jurisdictions, evaluating Mattels worldwide uncertain tax positions, and assessing the likelihood of realizing certain tax benefits. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect Mattels consolidated financial statements.  

Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. As a result, the tax expense reflected in Mattels consolidated statements of operations is different than that reported in Mattels tax returns filed with the taxing authorities. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in Mattels tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in Mattels tax returns in future years for which Mattel has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated statement of operations. Mattel records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Management evaluates the level of Mattels valuation allowances at least annually, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results.  

In 2007, Mattel adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 excludes income taxes from the scope of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. FIN 48 also requires that amounts recognized in the balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions be classified as a current or noncurrent liability, based upon the expected timing of the payment to a taxing authority.  

Mattel records unrecognized tax benefits for US federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions related primarily to transfer pricing, tax credits claimed, tax nexus and apportionment. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Mattels measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits is based on managements assessment of all relevant information, including prior audit experience, the status of current audits, conclusions of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, identification of new issues, and any administrative guidance or developments. Mattel recognizes unrecognized tax benefits in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits will more-likely-than-not be realized.  

The 2007 income tax provision includes net benefits of $42.0 million related to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes.

Table of Contents 

In 2006, Mattel recognized total tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of ongoing audits with foreign and state tax authorities. Of the $63.0 million of total tax benefit recorded, $57.5 million represents refunds of previously paid taxes, which was recorded as an expense in previous years. Accordingly, these refunds were recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period the refunds were received by Mattel. The remainder of the tax benefit recorded in 2006 is a net reduction to total income tax reserves resulting from tax settlements with foreign and state tax authorities.  

In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. The ultimate settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattels consolidated financial statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure  

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mattel includes a non-GAAP financial measure, gross sales, which it uses to analyze its operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Net sales, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations, include the impact of sales adjustments such as trade discounts and other allowances. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments, the 2007 Product Recalls, and the 2008 Product Withdrawal. Consistent with its segment reporting, Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, business unit, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattels business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products, making net sales less meaningful.  

A reconciliation of gross sales to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net sales, is as follows:
