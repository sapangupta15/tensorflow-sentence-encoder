PART I  

Item 1. Business.  

Mattel, Inc. (Mattel) designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide which are sold to its customers and directly to consumers. Mattels vision is creating the future of play. Mattels objectives are to grow its share in the marketplace, sustain gross margins of about 50%, leverage its scale to deliver cost savings and lower its selling and administrative costs, and create long-term stockholder value. To achieve these objectives, management has established the following strategies:  

The first strategy is to deliver consistent growth by continuing the momentum in its core brands, optimizing entertainment partnerships, building new franchises, and working to expand and leverage its international footprint.  

The second strategy is to optimize operating margins through sustaining gross margins of about 50% and delivering on cost savings initiatives.  

The third strategy is to generate significant cash flow and continue its disciplined, opportunistic, and value-enhancing deployment.  

Mattel believes its products are among the most widely recognized toy products in the world. Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories:  

Mattel Girls & Boys Brandsincluding Barbie® fashion dolls and accessories (Barbie®), Polly Pocket®, Little Mommy®, Disney Classics®, and Monster High® (collectively Other Girls Brands), Hot Wheels®, Matchbox®, and Tyco R/C® vehicles and play sets (collectively Wheels), and CARS®, Radica®, Toy Story®, Max Steel®, WWE® Wrestling, and Batman®, and games and puzzles (collectively Entertainment).

Domestic Segment  

The Domestic segment markets and sells toys through the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, and American Girl Brands segments.

In 2012, new products will be featured to support two full-length animated launches, Barbie in a Mermaid Tale® 2 in spring 2012 and Barbie® Princess and the Pop Star in fall 2012.

In June 2012, new products will be featured to support the theatrical release of the feature film, Disney/Pixars Brave and a broad range of dolls, fashions, and accessories will be released to support the Platinum DVD release of Cinderella.  

In 2012, Hot Wheels® will continue its overarching brand campaign with Team Hot Wheels.

The launch of the new infant physical activity line, featuring the Cruise & Groove Ballapalooza, stands as the ultimate innovation for a babys physical development.

The American Girl Brands segment is a direct marketer, childrens publisher, and retailer best known for its flagship line of historical dolls, books, and accessories, as well as the My American Girl® and Bitty Baby®

 brands. American Girl Brands also publishes best-selling Advice & Activity books and the award-winning American Girl® magazine. In January 2012, American Girl® introduced McKenna, the newest Girl of the Year® doll. American Girl Brands products are sold only in the US and Canada.  

International Segment  

Products marketed by the International segment are generally the same as those developed and marketed by the Domestic segment, with the exception of American Girl Brands, although some are developed or adapted for particular international markets. Mattels products are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence.  

Mattels International segment revenue represented 48% of worldwide consolidated gross sales in 2011. Within the International segment, Mattel operates in four regional groups that generated the following gross sales during 2011:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

No individual country within the International segment exceeded 6% of worldwide consolidated gross sales during 2011.  

The strength of the US dollar relative to other currencies can significantly affect the revenues and profitability of Mattels international operations. Mattel enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory, and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies, to limit the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its results of operations and cash flows. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 11 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsDerivative Instruments. For financial information by geographic area, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 14 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSegment Information.  

2012 Changes to Segments  

As part of Mattels Operational Excellence 2.0 program, effective January 2012, Mattel has modified its organizational structure, which will result in changes to its operating segments. The new operating segments are: (i) North America, which will include Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US, Fisher-Price Brands US, and Canada, (ii) American Girl, and (iii) International.  

Manufacturing and Materials  

Mattel manufactures toy products for all segments in both company-owned facilities and through third-party manufacturers. Products are also purchased from unrelated entities that design, develop, and manufacture those products. To provide greater flexibility in the manufacture and delivery of its products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, Mattel has concentrated production of most of its core products in company-owned facilities and generally uses third-party manufacturers for the production of non-core products.  

5  

Table of Contents 

Mattels principal manufacturing facilities are located in China, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Mexico. To help avoid disruption of its product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, economic instability, changes in government policies, and other risks, Mattel produces its products in multiple facilities in multiple countries. Mattel believes that the existing production capacity at its own and its third-party manufacturers facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume in the foreseeable future. See Item 1A Risk FactorsFactors That May Affect Future Results.  

Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a particular product line.  

The majority of Mattels raw materials is available from numerous suppliers, but may be subject to fluctuations in price.  

Competition and Industry Background  

Competition in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of toys is based primarily on quality, play value, and price. Mattel offers a diverse range of products for children of all ages and families that include, among others, toys for infants and preschoolers, girls toys, boys toys, youth electronics, hand-held and other games, puzzles, educational toys, media-driven products, and fashion-related toys. The Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US and Fisher-Price Brands US segments compete with several large toy companies, including Bandai, Hasbro, Jakks Pacific, Leap Frog, Lego, MGA Entertainment, Spin Master, Tomy, and VTech, many smaller toy companies, and several manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. American Girl Brands competes with companies that manufacture girls toys and with childrens book publishers and retailers. Mattels International segment competes with global toy companies including Bandai, Hasbro, Lego, MGA Entertainment, Playmobile, Tomy, and VTech, other national and regional toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. Foreign regions may include competitors that are strong in a particular toy line or geographical area, but do not compete with Mattel or other international toy companies worldwide.  

Competition among the above companies is intensifying due to recent trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products and an increasing use of high technology in toys. In addition, as a result of the phenomenon of children getting older younger, resulting from children outgrowing toys at younger ages, Mattel competes with companies that sell products outside the toy aisle, such as electronic consumer products and video games. Competition is increased further by the fact that a small number of retailers account for a large portion of all toy sales, control the shelf space from which toys are viewed, and have direct contact with parents and children through in-store purchases, coupons, and print advertisements. Such retailers can and do promote their own private-label toys, facilitate the sale of competitors toys, and allocate shelf space to one type of toys over another.  

Seasonality  

Mattels business is highly seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of all toy purchases during the traditional holiday season. A significant portion of Mattels customers purchasing occurs in the third and fourth quarters of Mattels fiscal year in anticipation of such holiday buying. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattels business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of less popular toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly in recent years, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase the risk that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that Mattels own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers manage  

6  

Table of Contents 

 their inventories, Mattel experiences cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause its sales to vary significantly from period to period.  

In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Seasonal shipping patterns result in significant peaks in the third and fourth quarters in the respective levels of inventories and accounts receivable, which result in seasonal working capital financing requirements. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 7 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSeasonal Financing and Debt.  

Product Design and Development  

Through its product design and development group, Mattel regularly refreshes, redesigns, and extends existing toy product lines and develops innovative new toy product lines for all segments. Mattel believes its success is dependent on its ability to continue this activity effectively. See Item 1A Risk FactorsFactors That May Affect Future Results. Product design and development activities are principally conducted by a group of professional designers and engineers employed by Mattel. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, Mattel incurred expenses of $179.0 million, $173.9 million, and $171.3 million, respectively, in connection with the design and development of products, exclusive of royalty payments. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 15 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSupplemental Financial Information.  

Additionally, independent toy designers and developers bring concepts and products to Mattel and are generally paid a royalty on the net selling price of products licensed to Mattel. These independent toy designers may also create different products for other toy companies.  

Advertising and Marketing  

Mattel supports its product lines with extensive advertising and consumer promotions. Advertising takes place at varying levels throughout the year and peaks during the traditional holiday season. Advertising includes television and radio commercials, magazine, newspaper, and internet advertisements, and social media. Promotions include in-store displays, sweepstakes, merchandising materials, and major events focusing on products and tie-ins with various consumer products companies.  

During 2011, 2010, and 2009, Mattel incurred expenses of $699.2 million (11.2% of net sales), $647.3 million (11.1% of net sales), and $609.8 million (11.2% of net sales), respectively, for advertising and promotion.  

Sales  

Mattels products are sold throughout the world. Products within the Domestic segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets, and, to a limited extent, wholesalers by Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US and Fisher-Price Brands US. Mattel also operates several small retail outlets, generally near or at its corporate headquarters and distribution centers as a service to its employees and as an outlet for its products. American Girl Brands products are sold directly to consumers and its childrens publications are also sold to certain retailers. Mattel has eleven retail stores, American Girl Place® in Chicago, Illinois, New York, New York, and Los Angeles, California, and American Girl® stores in Alpharetta, Georgia, Dallas, Texas, Natick, Massachusetts, Bloomington, Minnesota, Lone Tree, Colorado, Overland Park, Kansas, McLean, Virginia, and Lynnwood, Washington, each of which features childrens products from the American Girl Brands segment. American Girl Brands also has a retail outlet in Oshkosh, Wisconsin that serves as an outlet for its products. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. Mattel also has retail outlets in Latin America and Europe that serve as outlets for its products. Additionally, Mattel sells certain of its products online through its website.

Table of Contents 

During 2011, Mattels three largest customers (Wal-Mart at $1.2 billion, Toys R Us at $0.7 billion, and Target at $0.5 billion) accounted for approximately 38% of worldwide consolidated net sales in the aggregate. Within countries in the International segment, there is also a concentration of sales to certain large customers that do not operate in the US, none of which exceed 10% of net sales. The customers and the degree of concentration vary depending upon the region or nation. See Item 1A Risk FactorsFactors That May Affect Future Results and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 14 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSegment Information.  

Licenses and Distribution Agreements  

Mattel has license agreements with third parties that permit Mattel to utilize the trademark, characters, or inventions of the licensor in products that Mattel sells. A number of these licenses relate to product lines that are significant to Mattels business and operations.  

Mattel has entered into agreements to license entertainment properties from, among others, Disney Enterprises, Inc. (including ©Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse®, Disney Princess®, CARS® and Toy Story® from Pixar, Winnie the Pooh, and certain Disney films and television properties for use in Mattels games), Viacom International, Inc. relating to its Nickelodeon properties (including Dora the Explorer® and Go Diego Go!®), Warner Bros. Consumer Products (including Batman®, Superman®, Justice League®, and Green Lantern®), Sesame Workshop® through December 31, 2010 (relating to its Sesame Street® properties including Elmo), WWE® Wrestling, and HIT Entertainment relating to its Thomas and Friends® properties.  

Royalty expense for 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $262.4 million, $245.9 million, and $188.5 million, respectively. See Commitments and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 13 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsCommitments and Contingencies.  

Mattel also licenses a number of its trademarks and other property rights to others for use in connection with the sale of non-toy products that do not compete with Mattels products. Mattel distributes some third-party finished products that are independently designed and manufactured.  

Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents  

Most of Mattels products are sold under trademarks, trade names, and copyrights and a number of these products incorporate patented devices or designs. Trademarks, copyrights, and patents are significant assets of Mattel in that they provide product recognition and acceptance worldwide.  

Mattel customarily seeks trademark, copyright, and patent protection covering its products, and it owns or has applications pending for US and foreign trademarks, copyrights, and patents covering many of its products. A number of these trademarks, copyrights, and patents relate to product lines that are significant to Mattels business and operations. Mattel believes its rights to these properties are adequately protected, but there can be no assurance that its rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.  

Commitments  

In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into contractual arrangements for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery, and to obtain and protect Mattels right to create and market certain products. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the term of the contracts. Current and future commitments for guaranteed payments reflect Mattels focus on expanding its product lines through alliances with businesses in other industries. Additionally, Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for premises and equipment used in the normal course of business.  

8  

Table of Contents 

Purchase and service agreements with terms extending through 2016 contain future minimum payments aggregating approximately $406 million. Licensing and similar agreements with terms extending through 2016 and beyond contain provisions for future guaranteed minimum payments aggregating approximately $314 million. Lease commitments with terms extending through 2016 and beyond contain future minimum obligations aggregating approximately $473 million. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCommitments and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 13 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsCommitments and Contingencies.  

Backlog  

Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, which usually request delivery within three months. In the toy industry, orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment. In recent years, a trend toward just-in-time inventory practices in the toy industry has resulted in fewer advance orders and therefore less backlog of orders. Mattel believes that the amount of backlog orders at any given time may not accurately indicate future sales.  

Financial Instruments  

Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact Mattels results of operations and cash flows. Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to market risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory, and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts generally have maturity dates of up to 18 months. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.  

For additional information regarding foreign currency contracts, see International Segment above, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 11 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsDerivative Instruments.  

Seasonal Financing  

See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 7 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsSeasonal Financing and Debt.  

Government Regulations and Environmental Quality  

Mattels products sold in the US are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvements Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and may also be subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some US states.  

Mattels products sold worldwide are subject to the provision of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions including new product safety laws and regulations in the European Union and Canada.  

Mattel maintains a quality control program to help ensure compliance with various US federal, state, and applicable foreign product safety requirements. Nonetheless, Mattel has experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall  

9  

Table of Contents 

 could have a material adverse effect on Mattels results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect Mattels reputation and the sales of other Mattel products. See Item 1A Risk FactorsFactors That May Affect Future Results and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 4 to the Consolidated Financial StatementsProduct Recalls and Withdrawals.  

Mattels advertising is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, The Childrens Television Act of 1990, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as laws of certain countries that regulate advertising and advertising to children. In addition, Mattels websites that are directed towards children are subject to the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.  

Mattels worldwide operations are subject to the requirements of various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where those operations are located. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with those laws and regulations. Mattels operations are from time to time the subject of investigations, conferences, discussions, and negotiations with various federal, state and local environmental agencies within and outside the United States with respect to the discharge or cleanup of hazardous waste. Mattel is not aware of any material cleanup liabilities.  

Mattel is subject to various other federal, state, local and international laws and regulations applicable to its business. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.  

Employees  

The total number of persons employed by Mattel and its subsidiaries at any one time varies because of the seasonal nature of its manufacturing operations. At December 31, 2011, Mattels total number of employees was approximately 28,000.  

Executive Officers of the Registrant  

The current executive officers of Mattel, all of whom are appointed annually by and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, are as follows:
