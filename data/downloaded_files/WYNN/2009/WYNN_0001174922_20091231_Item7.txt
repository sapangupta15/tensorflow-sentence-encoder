ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview  

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened on April 28, 2005, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort located adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008, and Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), which opened on September 6, 2006. We are completing construction of Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau, which is expected open in April 2010. We believe that our properties are the preeminent destination casino resorts in their respective markets. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, we were solely a development stage company.  

Our Resorts  

The following table sets forth information about our operating properties as of February 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

       Twelve food and beverage outlets;  

       Approximately 27,000 square feet of high-end brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Hermes, Chanel and others;

       A showroom, nightclub and lounges.  

In response to the evaluation of our Las Vegas Operations and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resorts.  

Construction is currently underway to replace Encores porte-cochere on Las Vegas Boulevard with the Encore Beach Club that will feature pools, food and beverage, and nightlife offerings. The total project budget for the Encore Beach Club is approximately $68 million. The Beach Club is expected to open on schedule in the second quarter of 2010.  

Wynn Macau  

We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006 and we completed expansions of this resort in December 2007 and November 2009. We operate Wynn Macau under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. Wynn Macau features:  

       An approximately 222,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons and a poker room;  

       Luxury hotel accommodations in 600 rooms and suites;  

       Casual and fine dining in six restaurants;  

       Approximately 48,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Bvlgari, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Fendi, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu, Zegna and others;  

       Recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and spa; and  

       Lounges and meeting facilities.  

In response to our evaluation of Wynn Macau and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to the resort.  

We are completing construction on Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau that will add a fully-integrated resort hotel with approximately 410 luxury suites and four villas, as well as additional gaming areas, food and beverage and retail amenities. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in April 2010.  

Future Development  

On February 24, 2010, we announced we entered into a letter of intent with Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners, LP (PEDP), providing that one of our affiliates will become the manager and managing general partner in the PDEP casino project slated for the Philadelphia waterfront. The agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the approval of the Pennsylvania Gaming Board.  

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this property in the future, we have no immediate plans to do so.  

We have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres on Cotai and are awaiting final governmental approval of this concession. No construction timeline or budget has been prepared.

Current Economic and Operating Environment  

Due to a number of factors affecting consumers, including a slowdown in global economies, contracting credit markets, reduced consumer spending, and U.S. political leadership, the outlook for the gaming, travel and entertainment industries both domestically and abroad continues to remain highly uncertain. Auto traffic into Las Vegas, airline capacity and air travel to McCarran International airport have continued to decline year over year, resulting in lower casino volumes and a reduced demand for hotel rooms. This slow down was particularly significant in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued throughout 2009, most significantly affecting our U.S. operations. Based on our experience over this past year and current market conditions, we believe that our Las Vegas operations will continue to experience lower than historical hotel occupancy rates, room rates, casino volumes and departmental profitability. Significant new supply in Las Vegas will put additional pressure on occupancy and room rates during 2010. As a result of the current economic and market conditions, we have focused on efficiency initiatives that we began implementing at both of our properties and corporate offices in early 2009. These initiatives include reductions in pay for certain salaried employees, reduced work weeks for full-time hourly employees, a reduction of certain 2009 bonus accruals and a suspension of the employer match to the 401(k) plan. We continually review the cost structure of our operating properties and corporate offices to identify further opportunities to reduce costs. In addition to the slowing global economy, Wynn Macau was adversely affected during 2009 by certain visa restrictions implemented in September 2008.  

Results of Operations  

Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable as the year ended December 31, 2009 includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas for a full year, whereas 2008 included only 10 days of operations for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We also believe that our operating results at both properties for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were adversely impacted by the weakened global economy. Disruptions in the global financial and stock markets and reduced levels of consumer spending have and are likely to continue to adversely impact our financial results. In addition, as noted above, visa restrictions have placed certain limitations on visitation to Macau.  

The table below displays our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reliance on only two properties (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two properties, many of our customers are high-end gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.  

Operating Measures  

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented. There are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry. In Las Vegas and in the general casino at Wynn Macau, customers primarily purchase gaming chips from gaming tables. The cash and net markers used to  

39  

Table of Contents 

 purchase the gaming chips from gaming tables are deposited in the gaming tables drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our Las Vegas Operations and in the general casino at Wynn Macau for calculating win percentage.  

In our VIP casino at Wynn Macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable rolling chips from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage. Non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the non-negotiable rolling chips in the VIP casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Because of this difference in chip purchase activity, the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the VIP casino. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP casino play using this Rolling Chip method.  

The measurement method in Las Vegas and in the general casino at Wynn Macau effectively tracks the initial purchase of chips while the measurement method in the VIP casino at Wynn Macau effectively tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement in the VIP casino is much larger than the general casino. As a result, the expected win percent with the same amount of gaming win (numerator) is smaller in the VIP casino at Wynn Macau when compared to the general casino in Las Vegas and Macau.  

Even though both use the same measurement method, we experience different win percentages in the general casino activity in Las Vegas versus Macau. This difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games between the two casinos. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. The life to date table games win percentage for our Las Vegas operations is 21.9% whereas the life to date table games win percentage for the general casino at Wynn Macau is 19.9%.  

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:  

       Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.  

       Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box.  

       Turnover is the sum of all losing Rolling Chip wagers within our Wynn Macau VIP program.  

       Rolling Chips are identifiable chips that are used to track VIP wagering volume (turnover) for purposes of calculating incentives.  

       Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.  

       Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.  

       Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.  

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008  

As noted earlier, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2009 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2008, as the year ended December 31, 2009 includes the operations of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened on December 22, 2008, whereas the prior year includes only 10 days of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 are comprised of $2,206.8 million in casino revenues (72.5% of total net revenues) and $838.8 million of net non-casino revenues (27.5% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were comprised of $2,261.9 million in casino revenues (75.7% of total net revenues) and $725.4 million of net non-casino revenues (24.3% of total net revenues).

Table of Contents 

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $2,206.8 million represents a $55.1 million (or 2.4 %) decrease from casino revenues of $2,261.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expanded Wynn Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. Encore added approximately 90 table games and approximately 800 slot machines to our Las Vegas casino operations. Even with these additions in capacity, our Las Vegas Operations experienced only a 5.4% increase in casino revenues, from $479.7 million in 2008 to $505.8 million in 2009, due to an increase in drop of 1.2% and a slight increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 20.2%, which was below the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 20.0% for the prior year. Slot handle at our Las Vegas Operations decreased 2.5% during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%.  

Casino revenues at Wynn Macau decreased $81.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the prior year. At Wynn Macau, we experienced an 8% decrease in the VIP revenue segment primarily due to a 2% decrease in turnover and a decrease in our win as a percent of turnover. Our win as a percent of turnover was 2.9%, which was within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%, and compares to 3.0% in 2008. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play in that segment. In our general casino at Wynn Macau, drop decreased 12.2% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 21.9%, which was above the expected range of 19% to 21%. The average table games win percentage in the general casino at Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 19.6%. Slot handle at Wynn Macau increased 12.7% compared to the prior year and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. The increase in slot handle was primarily due to the play of high-end slot customers.  

For the year ended December 31, 2009, room revenues were approximately $377.5 million, an increase of $50.8 million compared to prior year room revenue of $326.7 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations increased approximately $52.6 million compared to the prior year due to the addition of 2,034 suites at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened December 22, 2008. In Las Vegas, we continued to experience a significant decrease in occupancy and room rates during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Room revenue at Wynn Macau decreased approximately $1.8 million due to a decrease in room rates compared to the prior year.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 include food and beverage revenues of approximately $436.4 million, retail revenues of approximately $165.1 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $57.1 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $66.2 million. Other non-gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 include food and beverage revenues  

41  

Table of Contents 

 of approximately $358.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $147.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.2 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $56 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, including a new night club, which opened in December 2008, offset by a decrease of $2.4 million at Wynn Macau, as compared to the prior year. Although we added new retail outlets at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, overall retail revenues in Las Vegas were flat. Retail revenues at Wynn Macau increased approximately $16.9 million due primarily to increased sales at several retail outlets and the opening of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry, which sells Cartier, Jaeger Le Coultre, and Kwiat products. Entertainment revenues decreased over the prior year primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show at Wynn Las Vegas in July 2008. This decrease was offset in part by revenue from headliner acts that performed during 2009, including Garth Brooks, who began performing in the Encore Theater in December 2009.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, departmental expenses include casino expense of $1,462.3 million, rooms expense of $109.2 million, food and beverage expense of $251.2 million, and entertainment, retail and other expense of $166.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $366.8 million and approximately $13.7 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2008, departmental expenses include casino expenses of $1,490.9 million, room expenses of $78.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $207.3 million, and entertainment and retail and other expenses of $161.9 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $319.3 million and approximately $49.4 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a decrease in casino revenues especially at Wynn Macau where a gaming tax of 39% is the significant driver of expense in that department. Room, food and beverage and general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. Entertainment, retail and other expense increased primarily in the entertainment department due to headliner performances during the year. Our provision for doubtful accounts receivable declined during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the prior year due to recent strong collection trends on our casino accounts receivable. This strength has allowed us to reduce the additional reserves we recorded in the third quarter of 2008.  

Pre-opening costs  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred pre-opening costs of $1.8 million compared to $72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 were related to Encore at Wynn Macau. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 were related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened in December 2008. We expect that pre-opening costs related to Encore at Wynn Macau will accelerate as we approach opening in April 2010.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009, of $410.5 million increased by $147.3 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to depreciation of the assets of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which were placed into service in December 2008.  

During the construction of our properties, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations are capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

42  

Table of Contents 

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.  

Property charges and other  

Property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $28.5 million compared to approximately $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009 included the following: (a) a $16.7 million charge for the abandonment of the front porte-cochere at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to make way for an addition to that property; (b) a $6.8 million charge for the write-off of 2 aircraft deposits; and (c) $5 million related to miscellaneous remodels, abandonments and loss on sale of equipment.  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 include $17.8 million of costs associated with Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas which closed in July 2008. The costs included the production rights that were included in intangible assets, show production costs that were included in other assets and certain other property and equipment. In 2008, we also incurred a $3.6 million charge at Wynn Macau related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space to begin construction of a new restaurant. The remaining property charges during 2008 were related to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.  

We expect to continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest income decreased $19.8 million primarily due to a significant decrease in the average interest rates earned on invested cash balances compared to the prior year. During 2009, our short-term investment strategy was primarily to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments were primarily in investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $211.4 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $172.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $87.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our interest expense increased due to (i) $76.7 million less of capitalized interest related to our construction activities with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008, (ii) approximately $8.4 million of interest related to the 7 7/8% $500 million First Mortgage Notes issued in October 2009, (iii) approximately $3.9 million of interest related to additional borrowings on our Wynn Macau credit facilities during the year and (iv) approximately $0.6 million of interest associated with increased interest rates on the Wynn Las Vegas revolver. These increases were offset by (i) approximately $38.6 million less interest due to the November 2008 paydown of the Wynn Resorts term loan, as well as the subsequent $375 million payoff of such term loan in June 2009, (ii) approximately $3 million less interest related to the purchase of $65.8 million of 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes and (iii) approximately $9.3 million less interest due to lower average interest rates on the remainder of our debt including the expiration of the Wynn Las Vegas interest rate swap in December 2008.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase/ (decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded an expense of approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we recorded an expense of $31.5 million resulting from the net decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

43  

Table of Contents 

As a result of several debt retirements, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, we purchased and retired outstanding loans of $375 million under the Wynn Resorts term loan at a discounted price of 97.25%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue cost. We purchased $65.8 million face amount of the Wynn Las Vegas 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 through open market purchases at a discount. This transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.7 million, net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs. As of December 31, 2009, Wynn Resorts holds this debt and has not contributed it to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. However, for accounting purposes this transaction has been treated as an extinguishment of debt by Wynn Resorts. In October 2009, we purchased loans through an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement, with a face-value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.1 million on early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

Other represents the loss recognized in connection with foreign currency remeasurements of assets and liabilities in Macau that are not denominated in the local currency.  

Income Taxes  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a tax expense of $3.0 million. Our provision for income taxes primarily relates to an increase in a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits resulting from the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds. As discussed in our footnote on income taxes (Note 15), we currently do not consider forecasted future operating results when scheduling the realization of deferred tax assets and the required valuation allowance but instead rely solely on the reversal of net taxable temporary differences. The ultimate realization of our recorded foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is dependent upon the incurrence of sufficient U.S. income tax liabilities attributable to foreign source income during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.  

As of December 31, 2009, we have provided deferred income taxes net of foreign tax credits on the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds (Note 13) planned for repatriation. No deferred income taxes have been provided for earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a tax benefit of $61.6 million primarily associated with foreign tax credits applicable to earnings not considered permanently invested abroad. As of December 31, 2008, none of our foreign earnings were considered permanently invested abroad.  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $31.7 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. In June 2009, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into an agreement with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provides for an annual payment of MOP $7.2 million (approximately $900,000 US dollars) to the Macau Special Administrative Region as complementary tax due by shareholders on dividend distributions. This agreement is effective as of 2006. Therefore, included in the tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009, are the amounts related to the years 2006 through 2009 totaling $3.6 million. This agreement on dividends is effective through 2010.  

In February 2010, we entered into a Pre-Filing Agreement (PFA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) providing that the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax and can be claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit. In January 2010, the IRS commenced an examination of the companys 2006, 2007, and 2008 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received the results of an IRS examination of our 2004 and 2005 tax returns and we filed an appeal of the examinations findings. In connection with that appeal, we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our 2004 and 2005 tax  

44  

Table of Contents 

 returns to March 15, 2011. We do not expect resolution of the findings within 12 months. We believe that our liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to the examinations findings are adequate. The resolution of the 2004 and 2005 IRS examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of our 2008 foreign tax credit carryforward.  

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our newly formed and indirect wholly owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, had its ordinary shares of common stock listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 (27.7%) shares of its common stock through an initial public offering. The $18.5 million represents the non-controlling interests share of our net income for the period from October 9, 2009, the date of the IPO, through December 31, 2009.  

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007  

Revenues  

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 are comprised of $2,261.9 million in casino revenues (75.7% of total net revenues) and $725.4 million of net non-casino revenues (24.3% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were comprised of $1,949.9 million in casino revenues (72.6% of total net revenues) and $737.6 million of net non-casino revenues (27.4% of total net revenues). Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008, did not significantly impact our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.  

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $2,261.9 million represents a $312 million (or 16%) increase from casino revenues of $1,949.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. At Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, we experienced a $162.6 million decrease in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a 7.1% decrease in drop and a decrease in our table games win percentage. Our table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 20.0%, which was below the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 25.3% for the prior year. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased 12.9% during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. As noted earlier, we believe the decrease in casino volumes reflect the overall slowdown in the global economy partially offset by the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In the fourth quarter of 2008, casino revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, declined 43.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of a decrease in table games drop of 20.2% and a decline in our average table games win percentage to 15.3% compared to 23.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased 22.7% during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  

Casino revenues at Wynn Macau increased $474.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the prior year. At Wynn Macau, we experienced a 47.4% increase in turnover in the VIP casino segment and our win as a percent of turnover was 3%, which is at the high end of our expected range of 2.7% to 3% compared to 3.1% in the prior year. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play. In our general casino at Wynn Macau, drop increased 14.2% when compared to the prior year and the table games win percentage was 19.6%, which is within the expected range of 18% to 20%. The table game win percentage at Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 19%. Slot handle at Wynn Macau increased 79.5% compared to the prior year and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. The increase in casino revenue at Wynn Macau is a result of growth during the first nine months of 2008 in the Macau market as well as our casino expansion which opened in December 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, total room revenues were approximately $326.7 million, a $12.7 million decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Room revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased approximately $17.2 million compared to the prior year due to lower occupancy and lower rates, while room revenue at Wynn Macau increased approximately $4.5 million due to increased rates. In the fourth quarter of 2008, room revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, declined by 14% as our occupancy percentage declined 14.6% and the average daily rate declined 6%, all compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Room rates have continued to decline as the economic slowdown reduces demand for our product.  

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue for Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $358.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $147.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.2 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $56 million. Other non-gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $354 million, retail revenues of approximately $123.4 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $64.5 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $57.3 million. The increase in food and beverage revenues and retail revenues were primarily driven by our Macau operations and to a lesser extent 10 days of operations of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by decreases at Wynn Las Vegas due to the economic factors noted earlier. General growth in the Macau market and our expansion, which opened in December 2007 (including additional retail outlets), were primarily responsible for the increases. Entertainment revenues increased approximately $10.9 million from Le Rêve at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by a decrease of $9.2 million due to the closure of Spamalot in mid-July 2008. Together with the producers, we elected to end Spamalots run at Wynn Las Vegas in July 2008 pursuant to the terms of our contract.  

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,491 million, rooms expenses of $78.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $207.3 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.9 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $319.3 million and approximately $49.4 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2007, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,168.1 million, room expenses of $83.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $212.6 million, entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.1 million, general and administrative expenses of approximately $310.8 million and approximately $36.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased over the prior year primarily related to the increased revenue at Wynn Macau as noted above, including the 39 percent gross win tax on casino revenues. Our casino revenues at Wynn Macau increased significantly during 2008 due to our expansion of that facility, which opened in December 2007, and general growth in the

Table of Contents 

 Macau market. Our revenues at Wynn Macau are subject to a 39% gross win tax whereas our Las Vegas revenues are subject to a 6.75% gross win tax. As a result, the ratio of casino departmental expenses to casino revenue is higher in Macau than Las Vegas. Macau accounted for a greater percentage of total casino revenue in 2008. Accordingly, casino expenses as a percent of casino revenues increased when comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007.  

Room expenses decreased $5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. During both periods, Wynn Las Vegas had 2,716 rooms and Wynn Macau had 600 rooms. On December 22, 2008, we opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore), which has 2,034 rooms. The addition of Encore for 10 days during the year ended December 31, 2008 had an immaterial impact on our room expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease experienced was primarily a result of reduced occupancy at Wynn Las Vegas due to the economic environment.  

Food and beverage expenses decreased $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, while food and beverage revenues increased $4.7 million. During 2008, we provided more complimentary food and beverage service to our casino guests compared to 2007. As disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the retail value of food and beverage furnished to guests without charge is included in gross food and beverage revenues and then is deducted as promotional allowances in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In accordance with industry practice, the estimated cost of providing such complimentary food and beverage is charged to the department that benefits from the issuance of the complimentary service, which is primarily the casino department. This resulted in a decrease in food and beverage expense while gross food and beverage revenues increased.  

General and administrative expenses have increased primarily related to the opening of our expansion of Wynn Macau in December 2007, offset by a decrease in employee bonuses in Las Vegas. The provision for doubtful accounts increased during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in reserves established in light of the current global economic uncertainty.  

Pre-opening costs  

Pre-opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $72.4 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2007. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. Pre-opening costs related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas ceased once it opened on December 22, 2008.  

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $263.2 million, an increase of $43 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to (i) depreciation expense associated with the opening of the expansion at Wynn Macau, a portion of which opened in September 2007, and the remainder which opened in December 2007; (ii) shortened estimated lives beginning in March 2008, of certain hotel room furniture, fixtures and equipment at Wynn Las Vegas based on a planned room renovation; and (iii) the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

During the construction of our properties, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.  

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Property charges and other  

Based upon our evaluation of our completed properties and the reactions of our guests, we have made and continue to make enhancements and refinements to our properties. Costs relating to assets retired or abandoned as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts are expensed as property charges. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $32.6 million compared to approximately $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $17.8 million of costs associated with Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas which closed in mid-July 2008. Together with the producers, we elected to end the shows run at Wynn Las Vegas pursuant to the contract. The charge includes production rights that were included in intangible assets, show production costs that were included in other assets and certain other property and equipment. We also incurred a charge of $3.6 million related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space at Wynn Macau to begin construction on a new restaurant. The remaining property charges were related to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.  

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the following charges at Wynn Macau: (a) a $10 million charge for the abandonment of our parking garage to make way for Encore at Wynn Macau, (b) a $10.2 million charge related to abandonment costs for portions of the main kitchen, warehouse and restaurants to enable the main casino to be connected with the expansion that opened in December 2007, (c) a $22.1 million charge related to significant casino and retail reconfigurations in the expansion that opened in December 2007, and (d) a $15.5 million charge related to the abandonment of a theater. The remaining property charges were related to renovations to portions of the Le Rêve Theater, the abandonment of a marquee sign and the conversion of two retail outlets and a nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas, as well as the remodeling of certain areas at Wynn Macau. Offsetting these charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a gain of $9.4 million on the sale of a company aircraft.  

We expect to continue to remodel and make enhancements at our resorts.  

Other non-operating costs and expenses  

Interest income decreased by $25.8 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates as compared to the prior year. During 2008, our short-term investment strategy was primarily to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments were primarily in investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less.  

Interest expense was $172.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $87.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $145.2 million, net of capitalized interest of $46 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest expense increased approximately $43.4 million due to borrowings under the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility drawn in late 2007, approximately $24.1 million related to the additional $400 million Wynn Las Vegas first mortgage notes issued in November 2007 and approximately $12 million net on borrowings from our Wynn Las Vegas, Wynn Macau and other credit facilities. These increases were offset by approximately $10.6 million less interest expense due to the conversion of the Debentures in July 2007 and an increase of $41.4 million in capitalized interest related to our construction activities. In future periods, interest expense will increase significantly as we no longer capitalize such costs related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.  

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded a net expense of approximately $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to the net decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net expense of $6 million due to the net decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt  

In November 2008, the Company purchased $625 million principal amount of its outstanding loans under the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility at a discounted price of 95.375%. This resulted in the retirement of $625 million of principal for a payment of $596.1 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $22.3 million on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and fees.  

On June 15, 2007, we announced that we had called for redemption on July 20, 2007, all of the then outstanding principal amount of our 6% Convertible Subordinated Debenture, due July 15, 2015 (the Debentures). Prior to redemption, in July 2007 all of the holders converted their Debentures into shares of the Companys common stock. As a result, in July 2007, the outstanding Debentures were converted into 9,744,680 shares of the our common stock. In accordance with accounting standards, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $93.4 million, which represents the difference between the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to extinguishment and the carrying amount of the liability on such date.  

Other represents the loss recognized in connection with foreign currency remeasurements of assets and liabilities in Macau that are not denominated in the local currency.  

Income Taxes  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a current tax provision of $1.9 million and a deferred tax benefit of $63.5 million.  

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we completed a study of the taxes, levies and obligations assessed on operations of Wynn Macau under Macau law and its Macau Gaming Concession. As a result, we recognized tax benefits of $722 million (net of valuation allowance increases) for foreign tax credits applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau. Of the $722 million, $650.6 million was used to offset 2008 U.S. income tax expense incurred as a result of the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and $71.4 million (net of valuation allowance) is recorded as deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2008, we had no earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested.  

Our effective tax rate/(benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2008, was (41.3%). This rate was 76.3 percentage points lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 35%, primarily due to the repatriation of foreign earnings and related foreign tax credits, a domestic operating loss, and the tax holiday applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau, S.A.  

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $27.7 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies (at a rate equal to 39%) in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flow from Operations  

Net cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $594 million compared to $523.2 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash provided by operations was positively impacted by a decrease in preopening costs that were incurred during 2008 related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and from ordinary working capital changes. These increases were offset by increased interest costs as we no longer capitalized interest in Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in 2008 and a decrease in departmental profit due to the current economic conditions.  

Capital Resources  

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.99 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations, debt service and retirement, development  

49  

Table of Contents 

 activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to our resorts, and to support the development and construction costs of Encore at Wynn Macau. Approximately $85.6 million of our cash balance is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. and Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $185 million of availability under our Wynn Las Vegas Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $500 million of availability under our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Except for scheduled quarterly payments totaling $2.7 million, we have no debt maturities in 2010. Debt maturities in 2011 are scheduled to be $77.9 million. We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities, and our existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2010. If any additional financing became necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.  

Cash and cash equivalents include investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and bank time deposits, all with maturities of less than 90 days.  

Investing Activities  

Capital expenditures were approximately $540.9 million, $1.3 billion and $1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to the construction cost associated with Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened in December 2008, expansions at Wynn Macau and the continued construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.  

Encore at Wynn Macau  

In June 2007, we commenced construction on Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. Encore at Wynn Macau is a second hotel tower for Wynn Macau situated on top of a new low-rise podium. Encore at Wynn Macau will add a fully-integrated resort hotel to Wynn Macau, planned to include approximately 410 luxury suites and four villas along with restaurants, additional retail space and additional gaming space. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in April 2010.  

We have executed a guaranteed maximum price contract with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as the general contractor for the construction of Encore at Wynn Macau. The current guaranteed maximum price, including change orders as of December 31, 2009, is $417.4 million.  

We expect total development and construction costs to be approximately $600 million. The project budget is being funded from our cash flow from operations at Wynn Macau and existing cash balances.  

As of December 31, 2009, we had incurred approximately $454.9 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.  

Financing Activities  

Wynn Resorts, Limited  

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our newly formed and indirect wholly owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 (27.7%) shares of its common stock. We received proceeds, net of related costs, of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of this transaction.  

In March 2009, we completed a secondary common stock offering of approximately 11 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $202.3 million. In November 2008, we completed a secondary common stock offering of 8 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $344.3 million. In October 2007, we completed a secondary common stock offering of 4.3 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $664.1 million.

Table of Contents 

In June 2009, we purchased and retired the remaining $375 million of outstanding loans from the $1 billion term loan we borrowed in June 2007, for the primary purpose of funding our equity repurchase program. The purchase price was $364.7 million reflecting a discounted price of 97.25%. In November 2008, we purchased and retired $625 million of this term loan. The purchase price was $596.1 million, reflecting a discounted price of 95.375%.  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we purchased $65.8 million face amount of the Wynn Las Vegas 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 through open market purchases for $50 million, reflecting a discounted price of 76.1%. As of December 31, 2009, we hold this debt and have not contributed it to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. For accounting purposes, this transaction has been treated as an extinguishment of debt by Wynn Resorts.  

In November 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $4.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This dividend was paid on December 3, 2009, to stockholders of record on November 19, 2009. Our Board of Directors also approved the commencement of a regular cash dividend program beginning in 2010. Our Board of Directors will continue to periodically assess the level and appropriateness of any cash dividends. In November 2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $6 per share on our outstanding stock. This distribution was paid on December 10, 2007 to stockholders of record on November 30, 2007.  

Our Board of Directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. No share repurchases were made during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 10,915,633 shares at a net cost of $940.1 million and during the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 1,889,321 shares at a net cost of $179.2 million. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program.  

Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities  

As of December 31, 2009, our Wynn Las Vegas Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), consisted of a $457.9 million revolving credit facility (the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver) and an $80.4 million term loan facility (the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan) (together the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities). As of December 31, 2009, we had borrowed $252.7 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We also had $20.2 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. Consequently, we have availability of $185 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver as of December 31, 2009. As described below, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we (a) extended the maturity of the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver to July 2013, (b) received relief from certain financial covenants, (c) increased the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver by $65 million, (d) repurchased $87.6 million of Wynn Las Vegas Revolver loans at a discount, and (e) used the net proceeds received from our $500 million 7 7/8 % First Mortgage Notes issuance to repay amounts outstanding, including a permanent reduction of the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities of $360 million.  

In April 2009, we entered into a fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment, among other things, (i) provides a waiver of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, until the quarter ending June 30, 2011, and increases such thresholds thereafter; (ii) provides additional flexibility with our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, by reducing such ratio from 1.75 : 1 to 1.25 : 1 beginning June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2011; and (iii) removes the dollar limit on the equity cure provisions for the purpose of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio over the life of the loan. In exchange for the amendments, we (i) repaid 30% of the outstanding revolver loans of lenders consenting to the extension of their commitment (approximately $238 million) and permanently reduced such lender commitments by 25%; and (ii) agreed to an increase in the interest rate spread on the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver from LIBOR plus 1.625% to LIBOR plus 3.0%.  

51  

Table of Contents 

In August 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we expanded the availability of the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver by $65 million.  

In September 2009, we entered into a fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment, among other things, (i) permitted Wynn Las Vegas to issue, on or before March 31, 2010, up to $500 million of new senior secured notes and (ii) requires that 75% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance of new senior secured notes be applied to prepay loans and reduce commitments under the Credit Agreement.  

In October 2009, pursuant to an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we purchased loans with a face value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. As a result of this transaction, the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver was permanently reduced by $43.8 million and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was permanently reduced by $44.8 million.  

In October 2009, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (the Issuers), our wholly owned subsidiaries, respectively, issued, in a private offering, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due November 1, 2017 at a price of 97.823% of the principal amount. The notes rank pari passu with the borrowing under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities and the outstanding 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes previously issued by the Issuers. The notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, are guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs subsidiaries (subject to some exceptions), and are secured on an equal and ratable basis by a first priority lien on substantially all the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors. In accordance with the fifth amendment to the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement described above, we used the proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan will be payable in two installments of $40.2 million each on September 30, 2012 and August 15, 2013. The Wynn Las Vegas Revolver matures on July 15, 2013.  

For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 3.0% on the outstanding balance. We also incur a fee of 1.0% on the daily average of unborrowed amounts. For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.875% on the outstanding balance.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities are an obligation of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement contains a requirement that we must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If our Wynn Las Vegas subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of greater than 3.5 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 3.5 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on the current economic conditions in which we are operating, we do not believe that Wynn Las Vegas will have excess cash flow for mandatory repayment pursuant to this provision of the Credit Agreement during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, and therefore we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2010.  

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the ability to sell assets, make capital expenditures, enter into capital leases, make loans or other investments and incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we were required by the financial covenants to  

52

 maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 1.25 to 1 as of December 31, 2009. Management believes that we were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. We will be required to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, of 6.50 to 1 for the quarterly reporting date ending June 30, 2011, 6.25 to 1 for the quarterly reporting date ending September 30, 2011 and 6.00 to 1 for each quarterly reporting date thereafter to maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio remains at 1.25 to 1 for the quarterly reporting dates through March 31, 2011, and then increases to 1.75 to 1 for the quarterly reporting dates June 30, 2011 to maturity.  

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities  

As of December 31, 2009, our Wynn Macau credit facilities, as amended, consisted of a $550 million equivalent fully-funded senior term loan facility (the Wynn Macau Term Loan), and a $1 billion equivalent senior revolving credit facility (the Wynn Macau Revolver) in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars (together the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement. As of December 31, 2009, the Wynn Macau Term Loan was fully drawn and we had borrowed $502 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver. Consequently, we have $498 million of availability as of December 31, 2009.  

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%.  

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that Wynn Macau must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If our Wynn Macau subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 4.0 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on current estimates we do not believe that our Consolidated Leverage Ratio during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 will exceed 4.0 to 1, and therefore we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2010.  

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, we were required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of not greater than 5.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2009, and Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, of not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that we were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. The Leverage Ratio decreases to not greater than 4.75 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending June 30, 2010, 4.50 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending September 30, 2010 and 4.00 to 1 for the quarterly reporting period ending December 31, 2010. The Interest Coverage Ratio requirement remains at not less that 2.00 to 1 for each reporting period during 2010.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $20.2 million.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2009 (amounts in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2009. Such rates are at historical lows as of December 31, 2009. Actual rates will vary.  

 [2] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for an aircraft purchase, land concession and fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8 Financial Statements, Note 15 Income Taxes, of this report, we had $148.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2009.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau debt instruments significantly restrict our ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing the 6 5/8% and 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; although the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of the subconcession sale and, provided certain conditions are met, earnings and the distribution of loan proceeds. As a result of the sale of shares in Wynn Macau, Limited in October 2009, we have approximately $1.2 billion of available cash that is not subject to such restrictions.  

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow, availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and to the extent additional funds are required, with additional contributions from Wynn Resorts. We cannot assure you, however, that our Las Vegas operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future contributions from Wynn Resorts or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Macau Revolver. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.  

Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.  

Credit Rating  

As of February 17, 2010, we had a rating of BB with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors and a rating of Ba3 with a no outlook by Moodys Investors Service. For future borrowings, any decrease in our corporate rating could result in an increase in borrowing costs.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.  

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates  

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of our properties, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our properties open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs. Start-up costs relating to Encore at Wynn Macau will be charged to pre-opening costs until it is completed and opened.  

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our properties, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our properties, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets.  

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.  

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in  

55  

Table of Contents 

 June 2029. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.  

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss.  

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. While offered, the issuance of credit at Wynn Macau is less significant when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at Wynn Las Vegas are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.  

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.  

As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, approximately 76% and 78% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries.  

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply industry standard reserve percentages to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customers financial condition, collection history and any other known information. The standard reserve percentages applied are based on our historical experience and take into consideration current industry and economic conditions.

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, approximately 27% and 29% respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at Wynn Macau.  

At December 31, 2009, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.1 million.  

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes in a regions economy or legal system.  

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. As of December 31, 2009, changes in the swap fair values are being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.  

We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. Accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. We categorize these swap contracts as Level 2. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.  

Share-Based Compensation  

Accounting standards for share-based payments establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the  

57  

Table of Contents 

 issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments we issue. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.  

The expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. We estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. For example, a 10% change in the volatility assumption for 2009 would have resulted in an approximate $5.7 million change in fair value. Expected term represents the estimated average time between the options grant date and its exercise date. Because of our limited trading history as a public company we have elected to use the simplified method prescribed by applicable accounting standards, for companies with a limited trading history to estimate the expected term. Once we have sufficient trading history, we will estimate the expected term using historical experience for options that have been granted to employees within our stock option plan. A 10% change in the expected term assumption for 2009 would have resulted in an approximate $3.3 million change in fair value. These assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.  

Accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).  

Significant Judgmental Accruals  

We estimate liabilities for certain self-insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as it believes necessary.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.  

As of December 31, 2009, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $835.4 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $689.4 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. The U.S. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of net foreign source income. Due to our current operating history of U.S. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the utilization of the foreign tax credits. The estimated future foreign tax credit realization was based upon the estimated future taxable income from the reversal of net U.S. taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. The amount of the valuation allowance is subject to change based upon the actual reversal of temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes which we adopted on January 1, 2007. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  

Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in accounting for income taxes (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).  

Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.  

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2009 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $31.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued new accounting standards regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities. These new accounting standards address the effects of elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept from previous standards. These new accounting standards amend previous guidance in determining whether an enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This determination identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entitys economic performance and the ability to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. These new accounting standards are effective January 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting these new accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements.
