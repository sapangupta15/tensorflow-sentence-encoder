A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor markets could adversely affect our business.  

Several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense, process instrumentation or electric motor markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions.  

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. Since the beginning of 2007, through December 31, 2011, we have completed 27 acquisitions. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:  

       Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;  

       The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;  

       Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;  

       Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;  

       U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;  

       Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;  

       Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and  

       Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.  

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

We may experience unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers.  

Certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to low-cost locales. Unanticipated start-up expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers, as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities, could result in production inefficiencies, which would adversely affect our business and operations.

Our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations.  

International sales for 2011 and 2010 represented 50.2% and 49.0% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. International operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:  

       Potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions;  

       Overlap of different tax structures;  

       Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  

       Changes in tariffs and trade barriers;  

       Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subjecting us to exchange rate exposures;  

       Restrictions on currency repatriation;  

       General economic conditions;  

       Unstable political situations;  

       Nationalization of assets; and  

       Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.  

Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.  

We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.  

Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.  

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.  

If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.  

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain  

13

 technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.  

A shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs.  

We have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier; however, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.  

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.  

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.  

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.  

We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products.  

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to  

14  

Table of Contents 

 potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of, for instance, an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.  

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are price, product technology, distribution, quality and service. EMGs competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. In the markets served by EIG, although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify. In the pressure gauge, aerospace and heavy-vehicle markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.  

Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.  

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility.  

We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.  

We engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit facilities, financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts.  

Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $2,789.2 million or 65% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
