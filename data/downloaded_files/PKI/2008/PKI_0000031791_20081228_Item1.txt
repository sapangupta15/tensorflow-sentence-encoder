Recent Developments  

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have taken the following actions:  

Strategic Business Re-Alignment:  

In November 2008, we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2009 that will allow us to prioritize our capabilities on two key strategic areas  Human Health and Environmental Health. Our new Human Health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics, tools and applications to detect disease earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. Our new Environmental Health segment provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. As part of this new alignment we placed our Photonics and Photoflash businesses from our Optoelectronics segment under strategic review and created separate plans to divest these businesses.  

We reported our financial results through fiscal year 2008 using the two reporting segments of Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, we will report our financial results under the Human Health and Environmental Health segments to reflect our new business alignment.  

Acquisitions:  

Acquisition of Opto Technology Inc. In January 2009, we acquired Opto Technology Inc. (Opto Technology), a supplier of light-emitting diode based lighting components and subsystems. We expect this acquisition to expand our portfolio of high brightness LED components by adding optical subsystems to provide energy efficient solid state lighting solutions to original equipment manufacturers. We paid the shareholders of Opto Technology approximately $21.0 million in cash plus a potential of $8.0 million in additional contingent consideration.  

Acquisition of Arnel, Inc. In December 2008, we acquired Arnel, Inc. (Arnel), a provider of custom engineered solutions for gas chromatography applications in the petrochemical, food and beverage, and industrial hygiene markets. We expect this acquisition to expand our chromatography portfolio and strengthen our application-focused products to better serve the biofuels and hydrocarbon processing industries.

Acquisition of Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. In February 2008, we acquired Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constituted the newborn metabolic screening business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc., and is now known as PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc. (PKI Genetics). PKI Genetics provides neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and various states. We expect this acquisition to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. We initially paid Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. approximately $66.3 million in cash. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we received approximately $0.3 million, from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. for net working capital adjustments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we paid approximately $2.3 million to Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale.  

We took the following actions to further strengthen our core businesses:  

Restructuring:  

During fiscal year 2008, we incurred $6.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities. We also recognized a $0.4 million pre-tax restructuring reversal in the Optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. Our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs.  

Discontinued Operations:  

Photonics and Photoflash Businesses Divesture. In December 2008, as part of our new strategic business alignment into the Human Health and Environmental Health segments and our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, our management approved separate plans to sell our Photonics and Photoflash businesses within our Optoelectronics segment. Our Photonics and Photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and intense pulsed light. These products are used in a variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine tools. We have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses.  

Certain Instrument Businesses Shut down. In December 2008, as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, our management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment: Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations Analytical Proteomics Instruments, and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments. We have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Cellular Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business included products focused on cellular imaging for kinetic and glow luminescence assays. The Analytical Proteomics Instruments business and the Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses included products for bioimaging, mass spectrometers for protein identification, high resolution multi-color fluorescence gel imagers, spot detection and spot excision instruments, as well as laser scanners for slide based microarray image analysis. We continue to serve the Cellular Screening, Proteomics and Genomics consumable and reagents markets. The shut down of the Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business, Analytical Proteomics Instruments business, and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments business in December 2008 resulted in a $4.8 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.  

ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology Businesses Shut down. Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board of Directors (the Board) approved a plan to sell the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with our acquisition of ViaCell, Inc., in November 2007. The ViaCyteSM business focused on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized   

5  

Table of Contents 

 oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focused on the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from umbilical cord blood. We determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, recording a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for severance and facility closure costs. We have classified the results and shut down of the ViaCyteSM and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.  

As part of our strategy, we also took the following actions:  

Share Repurchase Program:  

On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program). During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $56.6 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. These repurchases completed the repurchase of the 10.0 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the Repurchase Program. On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board has authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the New Repurchase Program). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by the Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program. From December 29, 2008 through February 20, 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program.

Brand Names  

Our Optoelectronics business offers its products under various brand names, including Cermax®, VQ, Heimann, Reticon®, SmartBlue, MultiBlue, DigiPyro®, ACULED®, Trim Xe, AesthetiPak, VIGI-Lux, Power Systems, and Amorphous Silicon.  

Marketing  

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces. As of December 28, 2008, we employed approximately 2,600 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries, and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.  

Raw Materials and Supplies  

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials. See further description in the applicable risk factor under Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Intellectual Property  

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.  

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of these matters.

Backlog  

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.  

Competition  

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.  

In our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.  

We do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our Optoelectronics segment across its full product range. However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes for industrial applications and ultra specialty lighting sources, photo detectors and photodiodes, and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product reliability and quality.  

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.  

Research and Development  

Research and development expenditures were approximately $108.1 million during fiscal year 2008, approximately $105.5 million during fiscal year 2007, and approximately $93.4 million during fiscal year 2006. The fiscal year 2007 amount included an in-process research and development (IPR&D) charge of $1.5 million related to the acquisitions of Evotec Technologies GmbH and Euroscreen Products, S.A. in January 2007.  

We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 primarily toward genetic screening, bio-discovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics markets within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2009, and to continue to emphasize the genetic screening, bio-discovery, and medical imaging markets within our Human Health segment, and the analytical sciences market within our Environmental Health segment.  

Environmental Matters  

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.  

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

Table of Contents 

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.0 million as of December 28, 2008, which represents our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.  

In addition, we accrued $9.7 million during fiscal year 2007 for a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005, representing our managements estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining payments of $4.2 million will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.  

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.  

Employees  

As of December 28, 2008, we employed approximately 7,900 employees in continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers councils. As of December 28, 2008, we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,000 union and workers council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.  

Financial Information About Reporting Segments  

The assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, accounting and finance, human resources, property and insurance management, information technology, treasury and other management and compliance costs, have been included as Corporate below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas  

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year 2008, we had $1,185.1 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. During fiscal year 2008, we derived   

16  

Table of Contents 

 approximately 80% of our international sales from our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and approximately 20% of our international sales from our Optoelectronics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.  

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
