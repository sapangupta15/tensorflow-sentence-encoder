ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY 

We are the world’s largest meat protein company and the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.

    2009 – We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount factors. The recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate. The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 10.1% in fiscal 2009 from 9.3% in fiscal 2008. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions. The increased discount rate resulted in the non-cash partial impairment of our beef reporting unit's goodwill. The impairment has no impact on managements' estimates of the Beef segment’s long-term profitability or value.    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

    2009 – The increase is due to the increase in our cash balance.

SEGMENT RESULTS 

We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. The following table is a summary of sales and operating income (loss), which is how we measure segment income (loss). Segment results exclude the results of our discontinued operation, Lakeside. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

    2008 – Operating loss included $26 million of charges related to: plant closings; impairments of unimproved real property and software; and severance.  

    2007 – Operating income included a $10 million gain on the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities.    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

      ●   SG&A Expenses – We reduced our selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 by approximately $37 million.  

      ●   Grain Costs – Operating results were positively impacted in fiscal 2009 by a decrease in grain costs of $28 million.  

    2008 vs. 2007 –  

    ●   Sales and Operating Income (Loss) – Sales increased as a result of an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume due to the sale of two poultry plants in fiscal 2007. Operating results were adversely impacted by increased input costs of approximately $900 million, including grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. Plant costs, including labor and logistics, increased by approximately $200 million. This was partially offset by increased net gains of $127 million from our commodity trading risk management activities related to grain purchases, which exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions which impact current and future period operating results. Operating results were also negatively impacted by increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $43 million.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

    2009 – Operating loss included a $560 million non-cash charge related to the partial impairment of goodwill.  

    2008 – Operating income included $35 million of charges related to: plant restructuring, impairments of packaging equipment and intangible assets, and severance.    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

    2008 vs. 2007 –  

    ●   Sales and Operating Income – Sales and operating income were impacted positively by higher average sales prices and improved operational efficiencies, partially offset by decreased sales volume due primarily to closure of the Emporia, Kansas, slaughter operation. Operating results were also negatively impacted by higher operating costs. Fiscal 2008 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $53 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $2 million recorded in fiscal 2007. Operating results were positively impacted by an increase in average sales prices exceeding the increase in average live prices.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

    2008 vs. 2007 –  

    ●   Sales and Operating Income – Operating results were impacted positively by lower average live prices and strong export sales, which led to increased sales volume and a record year for operating margins. Fiscal 2008 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $95 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $3 million recorded in fiscal 2007. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, as well as lower average sales prices.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and growth opportunities are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities, or short-term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances, our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

    ●   Additions to property, plant and equipment include acquiring new equipment and upgrading our facilities to maintain competitive standing and position us for future opportunities. In fiscal 2009, our capital spending included spending for: improvements made in our prepared foods operations to increase efficiences; Dynamic Fuels LLC’s (Dynamic Fuels) first facility; and foreign operations. In fiscal 2008, our capital spending included equipment updates in our chicken plants, as well as packaging equipment upgrades in our Fresh Meats case-ready facilities. In fiscal 2007, we focused on reducing our capital spending.  

      ●   Capital spending for fiscal 2010 is expected to be approximately $600 million, and includes:  

        ●   approximately $400 million on current core business capital spending;  

        ●   approximately $150 million on foreign operations, which includes post-acquisition capital spending related to our Brazil and China acquisitions; and  

        ●   approximately $50 million related to Dynamic Fuels, most of which relates to the completion of Dynamic Fuels’ first facility. Construction of the first facility is expected to continue through early 2010, with production targeted soon thereafter. At October 3, 2009, we had $43 million in restricted cash available for spending on this facility.   

      ●   Acquisitions – In October 2008, we acquired three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. The aggregate purchase price was $67 million, of which $4 million of mandatory deferred payments remains to be paid through fiscal 2011. In addition, we have $15 million of contingent purchase price based on production volumes anticipated to be paid through fiscal 2011. The joint ventures in China called Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods received the necessary government approvals during fiscal 2009. The aggregate purchase price for our 60% equity interest was $21 million, which excludes $93 million of cash transferred to the joint venture for future capital needs.  

      ●   Proceeds from sale of assets in fiscal 2007 include $40 million received related to the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities.  

      ●   Short-term investment was purchased in fiscal 2006 with proceeds from $1.0 billion of senior notes maturing on April 1, 2016 (2016 Notes). The short-term investment was held in an interest bearing account with a trustee. In fiscal 2007, we used proceeds from sale of the short-term investment to repay our outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006.  

      ●   Change in restricted cash – In October 2008, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds made available by the federal government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The cash received from these bonds is restricted and can only be used towards the construction of the Dynamic Fuels’ facility.    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

    ●   In fiscal 2008, we issued 22.4 million shares of Class A stock in a public offering. Net proceeds were used toward repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes.  

    ●   In conjunction with the entry into our new credit facility and the issuance of the 2014 Notes during fiscal 2009, we paid $48 million for debt issuance costs.  

    ●   We have $140 million of 2010 Notes outstanding. We originally placed $234 million of the net proceeds from the 2014 Notes in a blocked cash collateral account to be used for the payment, prepayment, repurchase or defeasance of the 2010 Notes. At October 3, 2009, we had $140 million remaining in the blocked cash collateral account.  

    ●   At October 3, 2009, we had $839 million outstanding 2011 Notes. We plan presently to use current cash on hand and cash flows from operations for payment on the 2011 Notes.    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  ●   The revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and letters of credit. Letters of credit are issued primarily in support of workers’ compensation insurance programs, derivative activities and Dynamic Fuels’ Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds.  

  ●   We completed the sale of Lakeside in March 2009. Inclusive of the working capital of Lakeside initially retained by us at closing, as well as consideration received from XL Foods, we expect the following future cash flows based on the October 3, 2009, currency exchange rate: approximately $10 million in fiscal 2010; $45 million in notes receivable, plus interest, to be paid by March 2011 by XL Foods; and $24 million of XL Foods preferred stock redeemable through March 2014. The discontinuance of Lakeside’s operation will not have a material effect on our future operating cash flows.  

  ●   Our current ratio at October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, was 2.20 to 1 and 2.07 to 1, respectively.    

Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets 

Credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continued into fiscal 2009. Several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures. While not all-inclusive, the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business: 

Credit Facility 

Cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $1.0 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit, and as a source of financing for growth opportunities. As of October 3, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit agreement totaling $267 million, none of which were drawn upon, which left $733 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 19 banks, with commitments ranging from $6 million to $115 million per bank. If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility, our liquidity could be impaired, which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs, support letters of credit or finance our growth opportunities. 

Customers/Suppliers 

The financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions. Although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers, current market conditions increase the probability we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults. Should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the United States and abroad, demand for protein products could be reduced, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows. In addition, we rely on livestock producers throughout the country to supply our live cattle and hogs. If these producers are adversely impacted by the current economic conditions and go out of business, our livestock supply for processing could be significantly impacted. 

Additionally, we have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate. Under these programs, we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices. The amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest. Participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost, or upon termination of the

agreement. Our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier’s net tangible assets. Although we believe the aggregate maximum obligation under the program is unlikely to ever be reached, the potential maximum obligation as of October 3, 2009, is approximately $250 million. The total receivables under these programs were $72 million and $7 million at October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers, we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers' assets. After analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions, we have recorded an allowance for these programs' estimated uncollectible receivables of $20 million and $2 million at October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, respectively. 

Investments 

The value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets, has been impacted by the market volatility over the past year. These instruments were recorded at fair value as of October 3, 2009. During fiscal 2009, we had a reduction in fair value resulting in the recognition through earnings of $11 million. 

We currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans. All three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants. Based on our 2009 actuarial valuation, we anticipate contributions of $2 million to these plans for fiscal 2010. We also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan. Based on our 2009 actuarial valuation, we anticipate contributions of $2 million to this plan for fiscal 2010. 

Financial Instruments 

As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases. Similar to the capital markets, the commodities markets have been volatile over the past year. Grain and some energy prices reached an all-time high during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 before falling sharply. While the reduction in grain and energy prices benefit us long-term, we recorded losses related to these financial instruments in fiscal 2009 of $257 million. We have recently implemented policies to reduce our earnings volatility associated with mark-to-market derivative activities, including more use of normal physical purchases and normal physical sales which are not required to be marked to market. 

Insurance 

We rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims, property damage and various other risks. Our primary insurers maintain an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A or better. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  ●   In fiscal 2009, we issued $810 million of 2014 Notes. The 2014 Notes had an original issue discount of $59 million, based on an issue price of 92.756% of face value. We used the net proceeds towards the repayment of our borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds made available by the Federal government to the regions affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005. These floating rate bonds are due October 1, 2033.  

  ●   In fiscal 2009, we bought back $293 million of notes, which included: $161 million 2011 Notes; $94 million 2010 Notes; and $38 million 2016 Notes.  

  ●   At October 3, 2009, we had a total of approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.    

Credit Ratings 

2016 Notes 

On September 4, 2008, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) downgraded the credit rating from “BBB-” to “BB.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due October 1, 2008. 

On November 13, 2008, Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Moody’s) downgraded the credit rating from “Ba1” to “Ba3.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due April 1, 2009. 

S&P currently rates the 2016 Notes “BB.” Moody’s currently rates this debt “Ba3.” A further one-notch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by an additional 0.25%. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

S&P’s corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is “BB.” Moody’s corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is “Ba3.” If S&P were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “B+” or lower or Moody’s were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “B1” or lower, our letter of credit fees would increase by an additional 0.25%. 

Debt Covenants 

Our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect to our capital stock; amend material documents; change the nature of our business; make certain payments of debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. If availability under this facility is less than the greater of 15% of the commitments and $150 million, we will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. 

Our 2014 Notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; make certain investments and restricted payments; create liens; create restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries; engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter new lines of business; engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions; and engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 10, “Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 3, 2009: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.  

  (2)   Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at October 3, 2009, and expected payment dates.  

  (3)   Amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.   

  (4)   Amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.  

  (5)   Amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.  

  (6)   Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of October 3, 2009.  

  (7)   Amounts include items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $233 million and related interest and penalties of $71 million at October 3, 2009, recorded as liabilities. During fiscal 2010, tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately $30 million, either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance. 

The maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at October 3, 2009, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $250 million, or approximately $178 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables. 

The minority partner in our Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods joint ventures in China has the right to exercise put options to require us to purchase their entire 40% equity interest at a price equal to the minority partner’s contributed capital plus (minus) its pro-rata share of the joint venture's accumulated and undistributed net earnings (losses). The put options are exercisable for a five-year term commencing the later of (i) April 2011 or (ii) the date upon which a shareholder of the minority partner is no longer general manager of the joint venture operations. At October 3, 2009, the put options, if they had been exercisable, would have resulted in a purchase price of approximately $74 million for the minority partner’s entire equity interest. 

RECENTLY ISSUED/ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Refer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and Note 2: Change in Accounting Principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. 

  Description     Judgments and Uncertainties     Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions  

  Contingent liabilities          

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. 

A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable.     Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control.     

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. 

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.  

  Marketing and advertising costs          

We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in-store display incentives, coupons and other programs. 

Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program. 

Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense.     

Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. 

These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs.     

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years. 

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. 

A 10% change in our marketing accruals at October 3, 2009, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $9 million.   

  Description     Judgments and Uncertainties     Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions  

  Accrued self insurance          

We are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. 

We use an independent third-party actuary to assist in determining our self-insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self-insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. 

We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self-insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range.     

Our self-insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used. 

Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self-insurance liability to change. 

Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self-insurance liability to change.     

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. 

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. 

A 10% increase in the actuarial range at October 3, 2009, would result in an increase in the amount we recorded for our self-insurance liability of approximately $15 million. A 10% decrease in the actuarial range at October 3, 2009, would result in a reduction in the amount we recorded for our self-insurance liability of approximately $3 million.  

  Impairment of long-lived assets          

Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset or a change in its physical condition. 

When evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long-lived asset. 

We recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $25 million, $52 million and $6 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007.     Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long-lived asset, including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.     

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets during the last three fiscal years. 

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long-lived assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.   

  Description     Judgments and Uncertainties     Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions  

  Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets      

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. 

The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit). 

For other intangible assets, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.     

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. 

While estimating the fair value of our Chicken and Beef reporting units, we assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the annualized margins realized in the most current year. The fair value estimates for these reporting units assume normalized operating margin assumptions and improved operating efficiencies based on long-term expectations and margins historically realized in the beef and chicken industries. We estimate the fair value of our Chicken reporting unit would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long-term operating margins of approximately 5.0%. After the $560 million non-cash impairment recognized in fiscal 2009, we estimate the fair value of our Beef reporting unit would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long-term operating margins of approximately 2.0%. 

Other intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace. 

Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.     

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years. 

The recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate. The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 10.1% in fiscal 2009 from 9.3% in fiscal 2008. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions. As a result of the significantly increased discount rate, we failed the first step of the fiscal 2009 goodwill impairment analysis for our Beef reporting unit and performed the second step. The second step resulted in a $560 million non-cash partial impairment of the Beef reporting unit's goodwill. 

No other reporting units failed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 and therefore, the second step was not necessary. However, a 10% decline in fair value of our Chicken reporting unit would have caused the carrying value for this reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would require the second step to be performed. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for the Chicken reporting unit's goodwill. 

After the $560 million non-cash impairment recognized in fiscal 2009, a 17% decline in fair value of our Beef reporting unit would have caused the adjusted carrying value for this reporting unit to be in excess of fair value. 

Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, and our credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill. 

Our fiscal 2009 other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment.   

  Description     Judgments and Uncertainties     Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions  

  Income taxes          

We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. 

Federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. 

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. 

Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. 

We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.     

Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. 

Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. 

Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. 

Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.     

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. 

To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefits have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefits, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
