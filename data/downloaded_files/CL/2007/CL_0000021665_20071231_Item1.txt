Research and Development  

Strong research and development capabilities and alliances enable Colgate to support its many brands with technologically sophisticated products to meet consumers oral, personal and home care and pet nutrition needs. Company spending related to research and development activities was $247.0 million, $241.5 million and $238.5 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents  

The Companys products are generally marketed by a direct sales force at each individual operating subsidiary or business unit. In some instances, distributors or brokers are used. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of the Companys sales.  

Most raw and packaging materials are purchased from other companies and are available from several sources. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. No single raw or packaging material represents a significant portion of the Companys total material requirements.  

The Companys products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. Products similar to those produced and sold by the Company are available from competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. Product quality and innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products largely determine success in the Companys business segments.  

Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Companys business. The Company follows a practice of seeking trademark protection by all appropriate means in the U.S. and throughout the world where the Companys products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Mennen, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, Elmex, Toms of Maine, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline, Suavitel, Hills Science Diet and Hills Prescription Diet. The Companys rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered. Although the Company actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.  

Employees  

As of December 31, 2007, the Company employed approximately 36,000 employees.  

Environmental Matters  

The Company has programs that are designed to ensure that its operations and facilities meet or exceed standards established by applicable environmental rules and regulations. Capital expenditures for environmental

 control facilities totaled $15.6 million for 2007. For future years, expenditures are expected to be in the same range. For additional information regarding environmental matters refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For financial data by geographic region, refer to the information set forth under the caption Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, of this report and in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company modified the geographic reporting structure of its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in order to address evolving markets and more closely align countries with similar consumer needs and retail trade structures. Management responsibility for Eastern European operations, including Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, was transferred to Greater Asia management, and responsibility for operations in the South Pacific, including Australia, was transferred to European management. The financial information for 2005 has been reclassified to conform to the new reporting structure.
