Item 7     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

 This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of SEC rules. We present such non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Companys operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. Organic revenue growth and organic growth in commissions and fees exclude the impact of acquisitions and disposals and year over year movements in foreign exchange from growth in revenues and commissions and fees. We believe organic revenue growth and organic growth in commissions and fees provide a measure that the investment community may find helpful in assessing the performance of operations that were part of our operations in both the current and prior periods,    

 and provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009.  

 This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the headings Business Overview and Market Outlook, Executive Summary, Operating Results  Group, Revenues, Interest in Earnings of Associates, Operating Results  Segment Information, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Contractual obligations  pensions. Please see Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.  

 REDOMICILE  

 On September 24, 2009, Willis-Ireland was incorporated in Ireland to facilitate the redomicile of the Groups parent company from Bermuda to Ireland. Willis-Ireland operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis-Bermuda until the Effective Time, when the outstanding common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled and Willis-Ireland issued ordinary shares, with substantially the same rights and preferences, on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the Willis-Bermuda common shares that were canceled. Upon completion of this transaction, Willis-Ireland replaced Willis-Bermuda as the ultimate parent company of the Group and Willis-Bermuda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of   

 Willis-Ireland. We do not expect the Redomicile to have a material impact on our financial results. We remain subject to the SEC reporting requirements, the mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and applicable corporate governance rules of the NYSE, and we continue to report our consolidated financial results in US dollars and in accordance with US GAAP. We also comply with any additional reporting requirements of Irish Law. The shares of Willis-Ireland are traded on the NYSE under the symbol WSH, the same symbol under which Willis-Bermuda shares traded prior to the Effective Time.  

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND MARKET OUTLOOK  

 We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide. Our core specialty businesses include Aerospace; Energy; Marine; Construction; Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance. Our retail operations provide services to small, medium and major corporations and the employee benefits practice, our largest product-based practice group, provides health, welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services.  

 In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and   

 insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.  

 We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Commission levels generally    

 25   
 follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, they may vary widely between accounting periods. Reductions in premium rates, leading to downward pressure on commission revenues (a soft market), can have a potentially material impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.  

 A hard market occurs when premium uplifting factors, including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital shortages, more than offset any downward pressures on premiums. This usually has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.  

 From 2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a hard market to a soft market, with premium rates falling in most markets. Rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006, with the exception of catastrophe-exposed markets. In 2007, the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this   

 continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines averaging 10% across our markets. The soft market had an adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through 2008.  

 In 2009, the stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe.  

 Our North America and UK and Irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market with no material improvement in rates across most sectors. This has resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations, particularly amongst our smaller clients who are especially vulnerable to the economic downturn.  

 In 2010, our main priorities will include driving revenue growth, continuing to execute our Shaping Our Future initiative, creating incremental savings to fund growth, completing the HRH integration and leveraging our growth opportunities from our expanded footprint.  

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

 Overview  

 Despite the difficult trading conditions in 2009, we reported 2 percent organic growth in commissions and fees in 2009 compared with 2008. This reflected growth in Global operations, in particular in Reinsurance, and many of our International businesses partly offset by a fall in organic commissions and fees in our North America, UK and Irish retail operations where revenues were adversely impacted by the continued soft market and weak economic conditions.  

 Operating margin for full year 2009 was 21 percent compared with 18 percent for 2008. The increase over 2008 was attributable to organic growth in commissions and fees, continuing control of costs and favorable foreign exchange movements, offset by increased pension costs and amortization of intangible assets.   

 Results from continuing operations: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Net income from continuing operations in 2009 was $436 million, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared with $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, in 2008. This increase included organic growth in commissions and fees, a reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review from $0.45 per diluted share in 2008 to $0.11 per diluted share for severance costs, in 2009 and a one-time tax release in 2009 relating to a change in UK tax law in 2009 equivalent to $0.16 per diluted share.  

 Total revenues from continuing operations at $3,263 million for 2009 were $436 million, or 15 percent, higher than in 2008. Organic revenue growth of 2 percent and a 19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals in 2009, driven by the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of HRH, were partly offset by a negative 4 percent impact from foreign currency translation and a $31 million decrease in investment income compared to 2008.    

 26   
 Organic revenue growth of 2 percent comprised 5 percent net new business growth (which constitutes the revenue growth from business won over the course of the year net of the revenue from existing business lost) and a 3 percent negative impact from declining premium rates and other market factors.  

 Operating margin at 21 percent was 3 percentage points higher than in 2008 with the increase mainly reflecting:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Results from continuing operations: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Net income from continuing operations in 2008 was $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared with $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, in 2007. The benefits of good organic revenue growth, improved margins in our International and Global operations and a lower effective tax rate were more than offset by a $0.45 per diluted share impact of charges for the 2008 expense review and a $0.27 per diluted share year over year impact from foreign exchange.  

 HRHs fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs and intangible asset amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted share. New shares issued as part   

 consideration for the HRH acquisition had an $0.11 dilutive impact on full year diluted earnings per share.  

 Total revenues at $2,827 million were $249 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent, a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals primarily reflecting the HRH acquisition and a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency translation were partly offset by lower investment and other income. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net new business growth of 6 percent and a 2 percent negative impact from declining rates and other market factors.  

 Operating margin at 18 percent in 2008 was 6 percentage points lower than in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting:  

     the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points;   

     an adverse year over year impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 2 percentage points; and   

     a $22 million increase in intangible asset amortization, of which $21 million related to HRH;    

 partly offset by  

     increased productivity, with revenues per full time equivalent (FTE) employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;   

     HRHs $38 million operating income in fourth quarter 2008, equivalent to 1 percentage point; and   

     good cost control, the realization of savings from 2007s Shaping Our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.    

 Discontinued operations  

 Income from discontinued operations relates to the disposals of our Bliss & Glennon and Managing Agency Group US-based wholesale insurance operations in the second and third quarters of 2009, respectively. There were no net gains or losses recognized on these disposals. These disposals were made as part of our plan to dispose of non-core HRH activities.    

 27   
 HRH acquisition and integration  

 On October 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, at the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States.  

 We remain confident that the acquisition of HRH:  

     substantially improves our position in key markets such as New York, Atlanta, California, Texas, Chicago, Boston, and Florida;   

     greatly strengthens our position as a middle market broker and adds critical mass in the large account, Employee Benefits, small commercial and private client areas; and   

     enables our North America operation to deliver enhanced value to clients through a more robust and diversified platform.    

 The integration of HRH with the existing Willis North America business was a key priority throughout 2009 and the process is now substantially complete. We believe that the goals we set for the integration are being successfully met, as we have:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We recognized goodwill and other intangible assets on the HRH acquisition of approximately $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.  

 Gras Savoye  

 In December 2009, we completed a leveraged transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the capital of Gras Savoye. As a result of this transaction:  

     we received cash proceeds, less costs, of $155 million which we used to pay down debt;     

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We believe that the revised structure enhances our financial flexibility, while at the same time retaining Gras Savoye as a key strategic partner.  

 As a consequence of the reduction in our ownership interest we expect earnings from our associates to be approximately $10 million lower in 2010 compared with 2009.  

 2008 Expense Review, Shaping Our Future and Right Sizing Willis  

 Our Shaping Our Future strategy is a series of initiatives designed to deliver profitable growth. As part of this we have invested in key hires and initiatives in 2008 and 2009 and we have funded these initiatives from a thorough review in 2008 of all businesses to identify additional opportunities to rationalize our expense base.  

 Additionally, in the latter part of 2008 and in light of the global economic uncertainty, we launched Right Sizing Willis to reinforce our cost saving initiatives. Right Sizing Willis initiatives include talent management to either improve or manage out poor performers, location optimization and aggressive reduction of discretionary spending.  

 In 2009 we incurred pre-tax severance costs of $24 million relating to approximately 450 positions which have been eliminated ($17 million net of tax), equivalent to $0.11 per diluted share, in connection with our Right Sizing Willis initiatives.  

 In 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $92 million ($66 million net of tax, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share) comprising:  

     $42 million to buy out remuneration packages that no longer align with the Groups overall remuneration strategy;   

     $24 million of severance costs relating to approximately 350 positions which have been eliminated; and      

 28   
     $26 million of other operating expenses, including property and systems rationalization costs.    

 In light of the current global economic uncertainty, we continue to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further growth initiatives. Our current funding for growth initiatives emphasize cost discipline including talent management, location optimization and robust management of discretionary spending.  

 In 2009, we realized approximately $100 million of gross benefits from previous initiatives, including:  

     approximately $30 million from global placement, which reflects increased commissions from working closely with our carrier partners;   

     approximately $20 million from client profitability, which aims to achieve increased remuneration from our clients in return for the value we deliver; and   

     approximately $15 million from a program of initiatives within Reinsurance focused on enhancing our client offering, including implementation of a global sales model, improving service delivery, developing further cutting edge analytical capabilities and hiring of additional production and specialist product resources.    

 Cash and financing  

 Cash at December 31, 2009 was $191 million, $15 million higher than at December 31, 2008.  

 In March 2009, we issued 12.875% senior notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of $482 million. These proceeds, together with $208 million of cash generated from operating activities and cash in hand, were used to pay down the $750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of December 31, 2008.  

 In September 2009, we issued $300 million of 7% senior notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our $250 million 5.125% senior notes   

 due July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling $160 million were tendered and repurchased on September 29, 2009.  

 Total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2009 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Liquidity  

 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents of $191 million at December 31, 2009 and $300 million remaining availability under our revolving credit facility.  

 Based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.  

 Share buybacks  

 The Board has authorized a share buyback program for $1 billion, of which $925 million remains available.  

 In 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $75 million. We did not make any repurchases in 2009.  

 We currently target a debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio of below 2.5 times. Once we are in a position to remain at or below this ratio, we would consider recommencing our stock buy back program. At December 31, 2009 the actual ratio was 2.6 times. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our target debt to EBITDA ratio or recommence our stock buyback program.

 OPERATING RESULTS  GROUP  

 Revenues  

 2009 compared with 2008  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, including contingent commissions related to the HRH acquisition, investment income and other income from reported revenues.   

     Acquisitions and disposals includes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, and contingent commissions related to the HRH acquisition.   

     Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.   

  (ii)   From fourth quarter 2008, we have changed our methodology for the calculation of organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.    

 Revenues for 2009 at $3,263 million were $436 million, or 15 percent higher than in 2008, reflecting a 19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals, principally attributable to HRH, and organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent, offset by a 4 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign currency translation and lower investment income.  

 Our International and Global operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2009, reported revenues were adversely impacted by the year over year effect of foreign currency translation: in particular due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the pound sterling and against the euro, compared with 2008.  

 Investment income was $50 million for 2009, $31 million lower than 2008, with the decrease reflecting significantly lower average interest rates   

 in 2009. The impact of rate decreases on our investment income was partially mitigated by our forward hedging program. In 2009 this generated additional income of $27 million compared with LIBOR based rates. We expect to see a lower benefit from our forward hedging program in 2010.  

 Organic growth in commissions and fees was 2 percent for 2009, despite a negative 3 percent impact from declining premium rates and other market factors. Overall organic growth comprises good growth in our Global operations and many of our International operations, partly offset by declines in our North America, UK and Irish retail operations reflecting the weak economic environments and continuing soft market conditions in these territories. Organic revenue growth by segment is discussed further in Operating Results  Segment Information below.

  (ii)   From fourth quarter 2008, we have changed our methodology for the calculation of organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.    

 Our 2008 total revenues at $2,827 million were $249 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007, reflecting a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals, principally attributable to HRH, organic commissions and fee growth of 4 percent and a 1 percent benefit from foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower investment and other income.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2008, reported revenues in International benefited from the year over year weakening of the US dollar against the euro, compared with 2007. However, in our Global operations the revenue line benefit of the stronger euro was offset by sterling weakening against the US dollar, compared with 2007.  

 Investment income was $81 million for 2008, $15 million lower than in 2007, with the decrease reflecting lower average interest rates in 2008.   

 Other income was $2 million for 2008, $17 million lower than in 2007 which benefited from a higher than usual level of proceeds from the sale of books of business.  

 Organic growth in commissions and fees in 2008 was 4 percent compared with 2007, reflecting:  

     net new business growth of 6 percent which comprised good growth in our International and Global Specialties businesses offset by lower revenues in North America and Reinsurance;    

 partly offset by  

     a negative 2 percent impact from premium rates and other market factors in 2008. The impact of significant rate decreases in both periods was tempered by the benefit of other market factors, including higher commission rates, client profitability analyses, higher insured values and changes in limits or exposures.    

 31   
 General and administrative expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2009 compared with 2008  

 General and administrative expenses at $2,422 million for 2009 were $181 million, or 8 percent, higher than 2008. The increase was mainly attributable to:  

     $414 million impact from HRH, equivalent to approximately 18 percentage points; and   

     a $66 million increase in pension costs, equivalent to approximately 3 percentage points. This excludes the $12 million US curtailment gain and $8 million due to the introduction of a salary sacrifice scheme in the UK. The increase attributable to the salary sacrifice scheme was marginally more than offset by a reduction in salaries and payroll taxes;    

 partly offset by  

     a year over year benefit from foreign currency translation of $172 million, equivalent to approximately 8 percentage points. This includes the impact of losses on forward contracts being more than offset by gains relating to the significant year over year strengthening of the US dollar against the pound sterling (in which our London market based operations incur the majority of their expenses), and the euro, together with the benefit of lower foreign exchange losses relating to the UK sterling pension asset;   

     the $92 million reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points, of which $66 million related to salaries and benefits and $26 million to other expenses; and   

     disciplined control of all discretionary costs, with significant savings in travel and entertaining, advertising, printing and a number of other areas.     

 Salaries and benefits  

 Salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for 2009, compared with 58 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefits of:  

     good cost controls, including our previous Shaping Our Future and 2008 expense review initiatives, together with the initial benefits from our Right Sizing Willis initiatives in 2009; and   

     a $12 million curtailment gain realized on the closure of our US defined benefit pension plan to accrual of benefit for future service, equivalent to approximately 0.5 percentage points (see below);    

 partly offset by  

     a $66 million increase in pension costs, mainly driven by lower asset levels in our UK pension plan and excluding the $12 million US curtailment gain and the impact of the UK salary sacrifice scheme.    

 Effective May 15, 2009, we closed our US defined benefit pension plan to future accrual and recognized a curtailment gain of $12 million in second quarter 2009. As a result the full year 2009 charge for the US plan was $7 million compared with an expected $39 million charge had the plan not been closed to future accrual.  

 We have also suspended the company match for our US 401(k) plan which benefited 2009 by $9 million compared with 2008.  

 UK salary sacrifice scheme  

 With effect from April 2009, the Company offered UK employees an alternative basis on which to fund contributions into the UK pension plans. UK employees can now agree to sacrifice an amount of their salary and in return the Company makes additional pension contributions on their behalf, equivalent to the value of the salary sacrificed.    

 32   
 From a payroll tax perspective, this is a more efficient method of making pension contributions.  

 As a result of this change, the Company made additional pension contributions of $8 million, with a marginally higher saving in salaries and payroll taxes.  

 Other expenses  

 Other expenses were 18 percent of revenues for 2009 compared with 21 percent in 2008, reflecting the benefit of:  

     the non-recurrence of $26 million of costs eliminated by the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 5 percentage points; and   

     a reduction in discretionary expenses driven by our Right Sizing Willis initiatives;    

 partly offset by  

     foreign currency translation losses of $40 million arising on forward contracts maturing in 2009, compared with losses on the equivalent contracts in 2008 of $12 million.    

 2008 compared with 2007  

 General and administrative expenses at $2,241 million for 2008 were $333 million, or 18 percent, higher than in 2007 of which:  

     $135 million, or 7 percentage points, was attributable to the fourth quarter acquisition of HRH;   

     $92 million, or 5 percentage points, was attributable to the charge for the 2008 expense review, of which $66 million related to salaries and benefits and $26 million to other expenses; and   

     a foreign exchange loss of $68 million, or 4 percentage points, including $34 million related to the revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset together with $23 million relating to sterling purchases to fund the Companys contributions to the plan.    

 Salaries and benefits  

 Salaries and benefits were 58 percent of 2008 revenues, compared with 56 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:  

     the $66 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review; and     

     continued hiring in targeted development areas including selected US regions; targeted International growth areas such as Spain, Italy, Denmark and Brazil; and a number of our London specialty businesses;    

 partly offset by  

     increased productivity: average revenues per FTE employee were approximately $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;   

     the benefits of cost controls and previous Shaping Our Future initiatives; and   

     a $15 million reduction in pension charges. This decrease was mainly attributable to an increase in the expected return on assets in the UK pension plan reflecting higher opening asset levels due to the significant additional contributions we have made.    

 Other expenses  

 Other expenses were 21 percent of revenues in 2008 compared with 18 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:  

     $33 million additional other expenses in fourth quarter 2008 as a result of the HRH acquisition, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point;   

     the $26 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point; and   

     a $34 million foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset. This asset is a sterling denominated asset but a portion of the asset is held within our UK London market operations, which are US dollar denominated for accounting purposes. As the US dollar strengthened significantly against sterling in 2008, the revaluation of the sterling pension benefit asset gave rise to a foreign exchange loss.    

 We have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from our London market operations, a part of which hedges the sterling denominated cash contributions into the UK pension plan. However, we do not hedge against the pension benefits asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes.  

 The effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the benefits of our continued focus on cost controls.  

 33   
 Amortization of intangible assets  

 Amortization of intangible assets of $100 million in 2009 was $64 million higher than in 2008.  

 The significant year over year increase was primarily attributable to additional charges of $58 million in 2009 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the HRH acquisition, including $7 million of accelerated amortization relating to the HRH brand name. Following the success of our integration of HRH into our previously existing North America operations, we announced on October 1, 2009 that we were changing the name of   

 our North America operations from Willis HRH to Willis North America. Consequently the intangible asset recognized on the acquisition of HRH relating to the HRH brand name has been fully amortized.  

 Amortization of intangible assets of $36 million in 2008 was $22 million higher than in 2007 with the increase primarily attributable to a $21 million charge in fourth quarter 2008 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the HRH acquisition.  

 Operating income and margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2009 compared with 2008  

 Operating margin was 21 percent for 2009 compared with 18 percent for 2008. This increase reflected the impact of:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 partly offset by  

     a $66 million increase in pension costs, excluding the $12 million US curtailment gain and the $8 million impact of the UK salary sacrifice scheme discussed above;   

     a $64 million increase in amortization of intangible assets, principally attributable to HRH; and   

     the $31 million year over year decline in investment income.     

 2008 compared with 2007  

 Operating margin was 18 percent in 2008 compared with 24 percent in 2007. This decrease reflected the impact of:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 partly offset by  

     increased productivity, with revenues per FTE employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;   

     a $38 million benefit from the operating income contribution of HRH in the fourth quarter; and   

     good cost control, the realization of savings from Shaping Our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.

 Interest expense in 2009 of $174 million was $69 million higher than in 2008. This increase primarily reflects higher average debt levels following the HRH acquisition, but also includes $5 million of premium and costs relating to the early repurchase in September 2009 of $160 million of our 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value.  

 We are currently reviewing opportunities to reduce future interest costs, in the short-term, through a fixed / floating interest rate swap.   

 Interest expense in 2008 of $105 million was $39 million higher than in 2007. This increase primarily reflects higher average debt levels, and in particular: $18 million additional interest expense relating to the term loan and interim credit facilities connected with the HRH acquisition; a $9 million charge for amortization of debt fees associated with these facilities; and a $9 million additional interest expense in 2008 due to fixed term $600 million senior notes issued in March 2007.  

 Income taxes  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2009 compared with 2008  

 The effective tax rate in 2009 was 18 percent compared with 24 percent in 2008. The decrease in rate reflects:  

     a $27 million release relating to a 2009 change in tax law. As at June 30, 2009 we held a provision of $27 million relating to tax that would potentially be payable should the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries be repatriated. Following a change in UK tax law effective in third quarter 2009, these earnings may now be repatriated without additional tax cost and, consequently, the provision has been released; and   

     an $11 million release relating to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits. There was a similar $5 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2008.    

 Excluding the benefit of these tax credits, the effective tax rate for 2009 would be 26 percent.   

 2008 compared with 2007  

 The effective tax rate in 2008 was 24 percent compared with 26 percent in 2007, with the decrease in rate reflecting:  

     a change in the geographical mix of profits with a greater proportion of profits being earned outside the United States;   

     non-taxable exchange gains arising from the significant movement in the exchange rate between the US dollar and sterling; and   

     a decrease in the statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK from 30 percent in 2007 to an effective rate of 28.5 percent in 2008;    

 partly offset by  

     the benefit of a $10 million release of uncertain tax provisions in 2007 compared to a $5 million release in 2008. Both 2008 and 2007 benefited from the release of tax provisions relating to prior tax periods following the resolution of tax issues surrounding prior debt refinancing; and   

     a one-off benefit of $4 million in 2007 relating to the restatement of the closing UK deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduced rate of corporation tax applicable on the reversal of those liabilities.    

 35   
 Interest in earnings of associates  

 Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, was $33 million in 2009, $11 million higher than in 2008. These increases reflect improved performance and an increased ownership share in Gras Savoye, our largest associate, for most of the year. As described within the Executive Summary section above, our interest in Gras Savoye reduced from   

 49 percent to 31 percent following the reorganization of that companys capital in December 2009. As a result of this transaction we currently estimate that the interest in earnings of associates will be approximately $10 million lower in 2010 compared with 2009.  

 Net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2009 compared with 2008  

 Net income from continuing operations for 2009 was $436 million compared with $302 million in 2008. The $134 million increase primarily reflected the $191 million increase in operating income, discussed above, partly offset by the $69 million increase in interest expense.  

 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2009 increased to $2.58 compared to $2.04 in 2008 as the benefit of the increased net income was partly offset by a 21 million increase in average diluted shares outstanding due primarily to the shares issued on October 1, 2008 for the HRH acquisition. The additional shares issued had a negative $0.36 impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009.  

 Foreign currency translation had a year over year $0.27 positive impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009.   

 2008 compared with 2007  

 Net income for 2008 was $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of:  

     the $66 million post-tax charges associated with the 2008 expense review, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share; and   

     a year over year accounting loss of $0.27 per diluted share primarily relating to the retranslation of our sterling denominated UK pension benefits asset;    

 partly offset by

 OPERATING RESULTS  SEGMENT INFORMATION  

 We organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International. Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks   

 arising from specific industries and activities. North America and International comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and major corporations.  

 36   
 The following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2009:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally.   

  (ii)   Corporate & Other comprises the following:    

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Global  

 Our Global operations comprise Global Specialties, Reinsurance and Faber & Dumas, our wholesale brokerage division launched in fourth quarter 2008 on completion of the HRH acquisition. Faber & Dumas comprises HRHs London-based wholesale operation, Glencairn, together with our previously   

 existing Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risk and Hughes-Gibb units. The following table sets out revenues, organic revenue growth and operating income and margin for the three years ended December 31, 2009:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together      

 37   
     with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $1 million net operating profit for full year 2007, previously allocated to the Global segment, has been reported within Corporate.   

  (ii)   Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, including contingent commissions related to the HRH acquisition, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.   

  (iii)   In fourth quarter 2008, we changed our methodology for the calculation of organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded. Comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.    

 Revenues: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Commissions and fees of $822 million were $38 million, or 5 percent, higher in 2009 compared with 2008 of which 4 percent was attributable to the acquisition of the HRH UK wholesale business, Glencairn and 4 percent to organic revenue growth. These were partly offset by a 3 percent negative impact from foreign exchange movements.  

 Net new business growth was 5 percent and there was a 1 percent adverse impact from rates and other market factors. Reinsurance led the growth in net new business. Global Specialties organic revenues were slightly higher than in 2008, as growth in Marine, Aerospace and Financial and Executive Risks was offset by reductions elsewhere. There was continued softness in most specialty rates although there were signs of stabilization and firming in some areas, including Aerospace and Energy. The Faber & Dumas businesses continue to be adversely impacted by the weakening economic environment.  

 There was a sharp decline in investment income in 2009 compared with 2008 as global interest rates fell markedly in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009.  

 Productivity continued to improve with a 3 percent rise in revenues per FTE employee to $358,000 in 2009 compared with 2008. Client retention remained steady at 90 percent for the full year 2009.  

 Revenues: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Commissions and fees were $34 million, or 5 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007 of which 3 percent was attributable to the net impact of acquisitions and disposals, mainly due to HRHs UK-based specialty business. There was no net impact from foreign currency translation as a benefit from the euro strengthening year over year against the dollar was offset by a negative impact from sterling weakening against the dollar.   

 Organic revenue growth was 2 percent as the benefit of good growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by lower commissions and fees in Reinsurance.  

 Global Specialties organic revenue growth reflected the benefit of good growth in Marine, Financial Institutions, Bloodstock, Jewelry, Specie and Global Markets and was achieved despite significant rate reductions.  

 Organic revenue growth in Reinsurance in 2008 was adversely impacted by a combination of declining rates and a reduction in amounts reinsured. We continue to make investments in Reinsurance to strengthen capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market and are beginning to see the positive results of this investment as we moved into 2009.  

 Client retention levels in Global improved to approximately 90 percent in 2008 compared with approximately 89 percent in 2007.  

 Operating margin: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Operating margin was 31 percent in 2009 compared with 29 percent in 2008. This improvement reflected a significant benefit from foreign currency translation, together with organic revenue growth, particularly driven by our Reinsurance business, and good cost controls including a reduction in discretionary expenses. The benefit of these was partly offset by a significant increase in the UK pension expense and the sharp reduction in investment income.  

 Despite an overall reduction in headcount since December 31, 2008, we continue to recruit selectively for our Global businesses. In first quarter 2009, we recruited a reinsurance team from Carvill. This team provides specialty, casualty and professional liability experience. We have also recruited specialty expertise in Marine, Aerospace and Faber & Dumas.    

 38   
 Operating margin: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Operating margin in our Global operations was 29 percent in 2008 compared with 28 percent in 2007, as the benefit of organic revenue growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by the impact of lower revenues in Reinsurance and an adverse impact from foreign exchange.  

 Operating margin in Global Specialties increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as the benefit from organic revenue growth, lower pension costs and our Shaping Our Future initiatives more than offset   

 further spend on targeted hires and strategic initiatives.  

 Operating margin in Reinsurance in 2008 was broadly in line with 2007 as the impact of lower commissions and fees was largely offset by the benefits of Shaping Our Future initiatives, lower pension costs and the positive results of our continued investments to strengthen capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market.  

 North America  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   Other income represents gains on disposals of intangible assets, including books of business. Prior to January 1, 2008 these gains were reported within total commissions and fees but were excluded from organic revenue growth with effect from April 1, 2007. As a result of this change, $17 million previously reported within North Americas commissions and fees in 2007, has been transferred to other income.   

  (ii)   Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, including contingent commissions related to the HRH acquisition, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.   

  (iii)    In fourth quarter 2008, we changed our methodology for the calculation of organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded. Comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.    

 Revenues: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Commissions and fees in North America were 51 percent higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the uplift from the additional revenues of HRH, partly offset by 3 percent negative organic growth. Our North America operations were significantly adversely impacted by soft market conditions, the weakened US economy and a reduction in project based revenues which more than offset a positive impact from net new business. In particular, our Construction division has seen significant declines. However, we saw the rate of decline moderate in the third quarter of 2009 and North America reported 1 percent organic growth   

 for the fourth quarter of 2009, despite a 6 percent rate headwind.  

 Our primary focus in North America in 2009 was the integration of HRH into our existing operations and the improvement of margin. Additionally, in the second half of the year we refocused our efforts on revenue growth and we believe this has led to over 10 percent new business generation in parts of the business during that time period.  

 Despite the difficult market conditions, our productivity measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee remained high and with a marginal increase to $226,000 for 2009 compared with $225,000 for 2008.    

 39   
 Revenues: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Commissions and fees in North America were $154 million, or 21 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007, of which $174 million was attributable to HRHs fourth quarter 2008 revenues. Excluding HRH, organic commissions and fees declined by 1 percent reflecting the soft market conditions.  

 Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Boston and Knoxville all generated growth in excess of 5 percent, though several offices recorded significant declines in the difficult market conditions.  

 The integration of the HRH acquisition made good progress in fourth quarter 2008 with only 2 percent attrition of legacy HRH producers since the announcement of the HRH acquisition in June 2008.  

 Client retention levels improved to approximately 91 percent in 2008, an increase of approximately 3 percentage points from 2007, and productivity continued to improve with an approximately 2 percent rise in revenues per FTE employee in 2008 compared with 2007.  

 Operating margin: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Operating margin in North America was 24 percent in 2009 compared with 15 percent in 2008. The higher margin reflected:  

     the acquisition of HRH and the synergies and cost savings achieved from the integration of HRH with our existing North America operations;   

     a reduction in underlying expense base reflecting the benefits of our 2008 Expense Review and Right Sizing Willis initiatives; and   

     a $9 million benefit from the curtailment of the US pension scheme relating to our North America retail employees;    

 partly offset by  

     the decline in organic revenues against the backdrop of the soft market and weak economic conditions discussed above.     

 HRH integration  

 The integration of HRH into our existing operations is now substantially complete and, reflecting this success, we changed the name of our North America retail operations from Willis HRH to Willis North America on October 1, 2009. Progress to date includes:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating margin: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Operating margin in North America in 2008 was 15 percent compared with 19 percent in 2007. The decrease of 4 percentage points reflected:  

     lower commissions and fees, reflecting the soft market conditions;   

     a $15 million decrease in other income compared with 2007 which benefited from higher than usual proceeds from the sale of books of business; and   

     continued spend on targeted new hires and other initiatives;    

 partly offset by  

     the acquisition of HRH which contributed $37 million of operating income in fourth quarter 2008; and   

     the benefit of increased revenue per FTE employee and other cost savings.

 International  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   Other income represents gains on disposals of intangible assets, including books of business. Prior to January 1, 2008 these gains were reported within total commissions and fees but were excluded from organic revenue growth with effect from April 1, 2007. As a result of this change, $2 million previously reported within Internationals commissions and fees in 2007, has been transferred to other income.   

  (ii)   In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $1 million net operating loss for full year 2007 previously allocated to the International segment, has been reported within Corporate.   

  (iii)   Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, including contingent commissions related to the HRH acquisition, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.   

  (iv)   In fourth quarter 2008, we changed our methodology for the calculation of organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded. Comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.    

 Revenues: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Commissions and fees in International were $35 million, or 3 percent, lower in 2009 compared with 2008 as double digit new business generation in many of our International units was more than offset by an adverse impact from foreign exchange of 8 percent, a 3 percent adverse impact from rates and other market factors, and significantly lower revenues in our UK and Irish retail operations.  

 A significant part of Internationals revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar which has strengthened significantly, on average, on a year over year basis against a number of these currencies, most notably the euro, pound sterling, Danish kroner and Australian dollar, consequently reducing International revenues on a year over year basis when reported in US dollars.  

 Despite the slowdown of the global economy, International continued its organic growth. Excluding our UK and Irish retail divisions, organic revenue growth was 8 percent in 2009, with Latin America and Asia, led by Brazil, Columbia and China, all reporting strong organic growth. However, our UK and Irish retail division, which   

 represents approximately 20 percent of Internationals operations, saw a 6 percent revenue decline, reflecting weak local economic conditions.  

 Productivity in International continues to improve with revenues per FTE employee increasing by 4 percent in 2009 compared with 2008.  

 Client retention levels remained high at approximately 90 percent for 2009.  

 Revenues: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Commissions and fees in International were $93 million, or 10 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007.  

 Foreign currency translation benefited 2008 revenues by 1 percent compared with 2007.  

 Organic revenue growth of 9 percent in 2008 was achieved despite declining rates in most countries.  

 We have seen consistent growth in our International business over the last three years, with all twelve quarters in this period showing growth of 5 percent or higher, with Spain, Denmark and Latin America continuing to contribute significantly.    

 41   
 Productivity in International continued to improve with revenues per FTE employee rising by 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 and average client retention levels remaining high at approximately 91 percent.  

 Operating margin: 2009 compared with 2008  

 Operating margin in International was 26 percent in 2009 compared with 28 percent in 2008. The benefits of:  

     the strong organic revenue growth outside of Ireland; and   

     focused expense management including savings in discretionary costs driven by our Right Sizing Willis initiatives;    

 were more than offset by  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Operating margin: 2008 compared with 2007  

 Operating margin in International was 28 percent in 2008 compared with 25 percent in 2007, with the 3 percentage point improvement reflecting the strong organic revenue growth, increased productivity and continued expense discipline partly offset by significant investment in targeted hires and the adverse impact of declining rates in most countries.  

 Venezuela  

 On January 8, 2010 the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency (Bolivar). Effective January 1, 2010, the Venezuelan economy has been designated as hyper-inflationary and, consequently, all future exchange movements will flow through the income statement.  

 Our preliminary estimate of the impact of these changes on our 2010 income statement is that diluted earnings per share for the Group may be approximately $0.03 lower than it would otherwise have been.  

 Currently, we do not anticipate any material impact on our balance sheet from the devaluation.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

 Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance. Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.  

 Pension expense  

 We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the US and UK. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants and, with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New entrants in the UK are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. These schemes have combined total assets of $120 million and a combined net liability for pension benefits of $30 million as of December 31,   

 2009. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.  

 We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination.  

 We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined benefit pension plans in 2009 of $32 million, compared to a net pension credit of $25 million in 2008, an increased expense of $57 million.    

 42   
 The UK plan charge was $63 million higher reflecting:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 partly offset by  

     changes to the plan that cap the impact of future salary rises on pension benefits.    

 The US pension charge was $6 million lower in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the closure of the scheme and the resulting $12 million curtailment gain.  

 Based on December 31, 2009 assumptions, we expect the net pension charge in 2010 to increase by $2 million for the UK plan and decrease by $6 million for the US plan.  

 UK plan  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   With all other assumptions held constant.   

  (ii)   Assumes all plan participants are one year younger. Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in 2009 remained unchanged at 7.8 percent, equivalent to an expected return in 2009 of $127 million. The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2009 were as follows:    

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 During the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our pension plans was significantly adversely affected by the turmoil in worldwide markets. The holdings of equity securities by our UK and US pension plans were particularly affected in 2008, but have recovered, to some extent, in 2009.  

 Rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at December 31, 2009 were based on yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities was 5.8 percent compared with 6.5 percent at December 31, 2008   

 with the decrease reflecting a reduction in UK long-term bond rates in the second half of 2009. The lower discount rate and reduced inflation assumption generated an actuarial gain of $208 million at December 31, 2009.  

 Mortality assumptions at December 31, 2009 were unchanged from December 31, 2008. The mortality assumption is the 100 percent PNA00 table without an age adjustment. As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2009 would have a life expectancy of 22 years.  

 43   
 US plan  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (i)   With all other assumptions held constant.   

  (ii)   Assumes all plan participants are one year younger.    

 The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net US pension scheme expense in 2009 was 8.0 percent, consistent with 2008. The rate used to discount US plan liabilities at December 31, 2009 was 6.1 percent, determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using   

 a corporate bond yield curve, a small reduction from 6.3 percent at December 31, 2008. The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2009 were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The mortality assumption at December 31, 2009 is the RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and non-annuitants), projected to 2010 by Scale AA (December 31, 2008: projected to 2009 by Scale   

 AA). As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2009, would have a life expectancy of 18 years.  

 Intangible assets  

 Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our intangible assets into three categories:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed. Over 80 percent of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition are amortized   

 over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.  

 To determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the HRH acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified independent appraiser. The calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions. We base our allocation on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets.  

 Impairment review  

 We review all our intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually) or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have    

 44   
 occurred. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated against our market capitalization. This analysis requires significant judgments, including:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  

 Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of 2009, did not result in an impairment charge (2008: $nil, 2007: $nil).  

 Income taxes  

 We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.  

 At December 31, 2009, we had gross deferred tax assets of $390 million (2008: $362 million) against which a valuation allowance of $92 million (2008:   

 $85 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.  

 Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In 2009, $11 million was released relating to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits. There was a similar $5 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2008.  

 Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities  

 We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but    

 45   
 not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case   

 reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice.  

 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

 New accounting standards issued during the year that would have a significant impact on the   

 Companys reporting are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 During 2009, we have taken a number of actions to significantly improve our debt maturity profile:  

     in March 2009, we issued 12.875% senior notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of $482 million. These proceeds, together with $208 million cash generated from operating activities and cash in hand, were used to pay down the $750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of December 31, 2008; and   

     in September 2009, we issued $300 million of 7.0% senior unsecured notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling $160 million were tendered and repurchased on September 29, 2009.    

 Since December 31, 2009 we have:  

     repurchased on the open market a further $7 million of July 2010 bonds; and   

     repaid the full value of $9 million in respect of a fixed rate loan note due 2010.    

 Once the remaining $83 million of senior notes due July 2010 are repaid, the only mandatory repayments over the next 5 years are the scheduled repayments on our $700 million 5-year term loan and $4 million due on a fixed rate loan note due 2012.  

 In the short term, our capital management priority is debt reduction and we are currently targeting a debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio of below 2.5 times. Once we are in a position to remain at or below this ratio, we would consider recommencing our stock buyback program. At December 31, 2009 the actual ratio was 2.6 times. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our target debt   

 to EBITDA ratio or recommence our stock buyback program.  

 Liquidity  

 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents of $191 million at December 31, 2009 and remaining availability of $300 million under our revolving credit facility.  

 As of December 31, 2009, our short-term liquidity requirements consisted of:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of:  

     the principal amount of outstanding notes; and   

     borrowings under our 2013 term loan and revolving credit facility.    

 Based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.  

 In an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through tender offers, cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such actions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  

 In September 2009, Standard and Poors and Moodys revised their outlook on the Company to Stable from Negative. We believe that the improved    

 46   
 outlook and our current ratings allow us more flexibility in our capital planning.  

 We continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. These actions include the rationalization of our cost base through our ongoing Right Sizing Willis initiatives to achieve the best structure within the current environment.  

 Fiduciary funds  

 As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. All of these balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet. We earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity, and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes.  

 Operating activities  

 2009 compared to 2008  

 Net cash provided by operations was $418 million in 2009 compared with $224 million in 2008. The $194 million increase between 2008 and 2009 mainly reflects:  

     a $198 million increase in net income before the non-cash charge for amortization of intangible assets; and   

     a reduction in pension scheme contributions to $82 million in 2009, compared with $154 million in 2008;    

 partly offset by  

     the timing of cash collections and other working capital movements.     

 2008 compared to 2007  

 Net cash from operations in 2008 was $51 million lower than in 2007, mainly reflecting:  

     an $81 million decrease in net income before the non-cash charge for amortization of intangible assets; and   

     a $65 million increase in cash payments for interest reflecting higher average debt levels, particularly following the funding of the HRH acquisition;    

 partly offset by  

     a $46 million reduction in additional contributions to our UK and US defined benefit pension plans;   

     the benefit of a $14 million reduction in taxes paid; and   

     the timing of cash collections and other working capital movements.    

 Investing activities  

 2009 compared to 2008  

 Total net cash inflow from investing activities was $102 million in 2009 compared with an outflow of $1,033 million in 2008, reflecting:  

     the $926 million net cash outflow attributable to the HRH acquisition in 2008;   

     $113 million cash received in 2009 in respect of investments in associates, compared with $31 million paid in 2008. The 2009 receipt includes $155 million from the reorganization of Gras Savoye, less $42 million settled in January 2009 for an additional investment in Gras Savoye made in December 2008; and   

     a $40 million increase in net proceeds from sale of operations, mainly attributable to the second quarter 2009 disposal of Bliss & Glennon.    

 2008 compared to 2007  

 Total net cash used in investing activities was $1,033 million in 2008 compared with $181 million in 2007. The movement was attributable to:  

     an $899 million net increase in the cost of acquisitions, primarily reflecting $926 million attributable to the HRH acquisition; and      

 47   
     a reduction in proceeds from disposals of operations, investments and other assets of $14 million;    

 partly offset by  

     a reduction in fixed asset spend of $91 million, principally attributable to sharply reduced expenditure on our new London and US headquarters buildings following their completion.    

 Financing activities  

 Net cash used in financing activities was $516 million in 2009 compared with an inflow of $808 million in 2008 and an outflow of $193 million in 2007.  

 Long-term debt  

 In March 2009, we issued $500 million of senior notes due 2016 at 12.875%.  

 We used the $482 million net proceeds of the notes, together with $208 million cash generated from operating activities and $60 million cash in hand, to pay down the $750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of December 31, 2008.  

 In September 2009, we issued $300 million of 7.0% senior notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling $160 million were tendered and repurchased on September 29, 2009.  

 In December 2009, we applied the net cash proceeds of $155 million from the Gras Savoye transaction, together with other cash in hand, to reduce the balance outstanding on the 5-year term loan by approximately $180 million to   

 $521 million, of which $27 million related to our first mandatory debt repayment.  

 As of December 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under our $300 million revolving credit facility (2008: $nil; 2007: $50 million).  

 Share buybacks  

 We did not buyback any shares in 2009. There remains $925 million under the current buyback authorization.  

 In 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $75 million and in 2007 we repurchased 11.5 million shares for $480 million of cash.  

 In 2009, the Company filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC to repurchase for cash options to purchase Company shares. The tender offer expired on August 6, 2009. Approximately 1.6 million options to purchase Company shares were repurchased at an average per share price of $2.04.  

 Dividends  

 Cash dividends paid in 2009 were $174 million compared with $146 million in 2008 and $143 million in 2007.  

 The $28 million increase primarily reflects dividend payments on the 24 million additional shares issued in connection with the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of HRH. In February 2010, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share, an annual rate of $1.04 per share, subject to the Irish High Court approving a reduction of our share capital in order to create distributable reserves, (which under Irish law are required to facilitate the payment of a dividend), and compliance generally with the requirements of the Irish Companies Act relating to the payment of dividends.

 Debt facilities  

 In March 2009, we issued 12.875% senior notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of $482 million. These proceeds, together with $208 million cash generated from operating activities and cash in hand, were used to pay down the $750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of December 31, 2008.  

 In September 2009, we issued $300 million of 7.0% senior notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling approximately $160 million were tendered and repurchased on September 29, 2009.  

 In December 2009, we applied the net cash proceeds of $155 million from the Gras Savoye transaction, together with other cash in hand, to reduce the balance outstanding on the 5-year term loan by approximately $180 million to $521 million.   

 Since the end of the year, we have:  

     repurchased a further $7 million of July 2010 bonds; and   

     repaid the full value of $9 million in respect of a fixed rate loan note due 2010.    

 Once the remaining $83 million of July 2010 bonds are repaid, the only mandatory repayments over the next 5 years are the scheduled repayments on our $700 million 5-year term loan and $4 million due on a fixed rate loan note due 2012.  

 Operating leases  

 We lease our London headquarters building under a 25 year operating lease, which expires in 2032. Annual rentals are $31 million per year and we have subleased approximately 30 percent of the premises under leases up to 15 years. The outstanding contractual obligation for lease rentals at December 31, 2009 was $785 million and the amounts receivable from subleases was $100 million.    

 49   
 Pensions  

 Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans.  

 In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our UK defined benefit plan with the plans trustees. In February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the UK plan of $40 million for 2009 through 2012, excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition, as certain funding targets have not been met at the beginning of 2010, a further contribution   

 of $40 million is required for 2010. A similar, additional contribution may also be required for 2011, depending on actual performance against funding targets at the beginning of 2011.  

 For the US plan, expected contributions are the contributions we will be required to make under US pension legislation based on our December 31, 2009 balance sheet position. We currently expect to contribute $30 million in 2010 and $30 million per year from 2011 to 2014.  

 The total contributions for all plans are currently estimated to be approximately $120 million in 2010 excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme.  

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS  

 Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or   

 are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
