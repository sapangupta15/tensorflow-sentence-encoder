PART I  

ITEM 1. Business. Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a leading worldwide full-line diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, including fluid power systems, electromechanical controls and related components. Fluid power involves the transfer and control of power through the medium of liquid, gas or air, in hydraulic, pneumatic and vacuum applications. Fluid power systems move and position materials, control machines, vehicles and equipment and improve industrial efficiency and productivity. Components of a simple fluid power system include one or more pumps which generate pressure, one or more valves which control the flow of the fluid, one or more actuators which translate the pressure from the fluid into mechanical energy, one or more filters to ensure proper fluid condition and numerous hoses, couplings, fittings and seals. Electromechanical controls involve the use of electronic components and systems to control motion and precisely locate or vary speed in automation and aerospace applications. In addition to motion and control products, the Company also is a leading worldwide producer of fluid purification, fluid and fuel control, process instrumentation, air conditioning, refrigeration, electromagnetic shielding and thermal management products and systems.

Competition  

The Companys business is highly competitive. No single manufacturer competes with the Company with respect to all products manufactured and sold by the Company and the degree of competition varies among different products. In the Industrial Segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. The Company believes that it is one of the primary suppliers of motion control systems and components in most of the major markets for its Industrial Segment products.  

In the Aerospace Segment, the Company has developed alliances with key customers based on the Companys advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, and service, and price competitiveness, which has enabled the Company to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for its systems and components and to thereby obtain the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs. The Company believes that it is one of the primary suppliers in the aerospace market.  

In the Climate & Industrial Controls Segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. The Company believes that it is one of the primary suppliers in the climate and industrial controls market.  

Research and Product Development  

The Company continually researches the feasibility of new products and services through its development laboratories and testing facilities in many of its worldwide manufacturing locations. Its research and product development staff includes chemists, physicists, and mechanical, chemical and electrical engineers.  

- 7 -  

Total research and development costs relating to the development of new products and services and the improvement of existing products and services amounted to $338,907,820 in fiscal year 2009, $303,097,752 in fiscal year 2008, and $253,091,228 in fiscal year 2007. These amounts include costs incurred by the Company related to independent research and development initiatives as well as costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts. Costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts and included in the total research and development costs reported above for each of the respective fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $50,739,381, $47,757,134 and $40,893,768.  

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses   

The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use a number of patents owned by others. In addition, patent applications on certain products are now pending, although there can be no assurance that patents will be issued. The Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents.  

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business  

The Companys backlog by business segment for the past two fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-4 to 13-6 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this section by reference. The Companys backlog at June 30, 2009 was $2,885,284,015 and at June 30, 2008 was $3,651,285,185. Approximately 80% of the Companys backlog at June 30, 2009 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Companys business generally is not seasonal in nature.  

Environmental Regulation  

The Company is subject to United States federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the United States federal Superfund law, under which the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list.  

As of June 30, 2009, the Company is involved in environmental remediation at various manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a potentially responsible party, along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites.  

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management of efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.  

- 8 -  

As of June 30, 2009, the Company has a reserve of $13,891,137 for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties.  

The Companys estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $13,891,137 to a maximum of $74,197,967. The largest range for any one site is approximately $8,621,973. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final determination of contamination, final determination of remedial action required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or third-party recoveries.  

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials  

The Companys primary energy source for each of its business segments is electric power. While the Company cannot predict future costs of such electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.  

Steel, brass, aluminum, elastomeric and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.  

Employees  

The Company employed 51,639 persons as of June 30, 2009, of whom approximately 27,917 were employed by foreign subsidiaries.  

Business Segment Information  

The Companys net sales, segment operating income and assets by business segment and net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area for the past three fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-14 to 13-15 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are incorporated into this section by reference.
