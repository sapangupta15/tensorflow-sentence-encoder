ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Executive Overview  

Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.  

To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organizations core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.  

Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Companys sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Companys exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.  

The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hills Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers.  

On an on-going basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Companys corporate governance practices (including the Companys Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained.   

To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Companys products.  

The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.

Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its household bleach businesses in Latin America and Canada. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. In the Latin American countries, the transaction closed during the first quarter of 2007 with the exception of Colombia, where the transaction did not receive regulatory approval.  

The Companys previously announced 2004 Restructuring Program to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $1,069.2 ($775.5 aftertax). Savings are estimated to be in the range of $475 and $500 pretax ($350 and $375 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which will increase future cash flows.  

As a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program, we streamlined our global supply chain, reallocated resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing countries and other key markets, and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with our other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability.  

As further explained in the Outlook section below, while we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging in 2009, we believe the Company is well-positioned to deliver increased shareholder value over the long-term.  

Results of Operations  

Net Sales  

Worldwide Net sales were $15,329.9 in 2008, up 11.0% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.0%. The 2007 divestment of the Latin American household bleach business and the 2008 divestment of the Senegal fabric care business reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2007. Excluding the impact of these divestments, Net sales increased 11.5% in 2008 on volume growth of 4.0%. Organic sales (Net sales excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) grew 9.5% in 2008.  

Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $13,182.4 in 2008, up 10.5% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 4.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Excluding the 0.5% impact of the above-described divestments, Net sales increased 11.0% in 2008 on volume growth of 4.0%. Organic sales grew 8.5% in 2008.  

Net sales in Hills Pet Nutrition were $2,147.5 in 2008, up 15.5% from 2007, driven by volume growth of 2.5%, net selling price increases of 10.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Organic sales grew 13.0% in 2008.  

Worldwide Net sales were $13,789.7 in 2007, up 12.5% from 2006, driven by volume growth of 6.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.0%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses in 2007 and 2006, respectively, reduced sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007 by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.0% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.0%. Organic sales grew 8.0% in 2007.

Gross Profit  

Worldwide gross profit margin was 56.3% in 2008, 56.2% in 2007 and 54.8% in 2006. Restructuring and implementation-related charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $58.8, $153.8 and $196.2, respectively. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 40 basis points (bps), 110 bps and 160 bps in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin was 56.7% in 2008, 57.3% in 2007 and 56.4% in 2006. On this basis, the decrease in 2008 was due to increases in raw and packaging material costs, partially offset by higher pricing and a continued focus on cost-savings programs. The increase in 2007 was due to cost-savings programs and the shift towards higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs.  

For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 35.4% in 2008, 36.1% in 2007 and 35.6% in 2006. Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses are charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $81.0 (0.5% of Net sales) in 2008, $49.1 (0.4% of Net sales) in 2007 and $46.1 (0.4% of Net sales) in 2006. The 70 bps decrease in 2008 was driven primarily by moderating levels of advertising investment (40 bps) and a continued focus on cost-savings programs. While advertising was lower as a percentage of Net sales, total advertising increased 7% to $1,649.5 as compared to 2007, on top of a 17% increase in the year-ago period. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2007 increased by a net 50 bps as compared to 2006, primarily due to increased levels of advertising (40 bps) and an increase in shipping and handling costs.  

Other (Income) Expense, Net  

Other (income) expense, net was $183.4, $121.3 and $185.9 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below:

Operating Profit  

In 2008, Operating profit increased 14% to $3,020.7 as compared to $2,653.1 in 2007 and increased 23% in 2007 as compared to $2,160.5 in 2006. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items set forth below, Operating profit increased 10% in 2008 and 15% in 2007 as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net was $95.6 in 2008 compared with $156.6 in 2007 and $158.7 in 2006. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2007 to 2008 was due to lower average interest rates.  

Income Taxes  

The effective income tax rate was 33.1% in 2008, 30.4% in 2007 and 32.4% in 2006. The tax rate in all years benefited from global tax planning strategies and was increased (decreased) by the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and other discrete items as follows: 10 bps in 2008, (250 bps) in 2007 and 50 bps in 2006. The 2008 effective tax rate reflects the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program. The 2007 effective tax rate reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $73.9 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $94.6 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and increases of 40 bps from the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. The 2006 effective tax rate reflects an increase of 80 bps from the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a decrease of 30 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Canada.  

Further impacting the effective rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 was the cost associated with higher remittances from overseas subsidiaries and the one-time adjustment resulting from changes in statutory tax rates in certain overseas subsidiaries.  

The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period has depended on the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2008, 2007 and 2006 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 31.4%, 28.9% and 27.6%, respectively.  

For additional information regarding the Companys income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Income  

Net income was $1,957.2, or $3.66 per share on a diluted basis, in 2008 compared with $1,737.4, or $3.20 per share, in 2007 and $1,353.4, or $2.46 per share, in 2006. Net income in 2008 included $112.4 ($0.21 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program. Net income in 2007 included a $29.7 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $73.9 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above. Such benefits were more than offset by $183.7 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, $10.0 ($0.02 per share) of SFAS 88 pension charges and $8.2 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products. Net income in 2006 included a $38.2 ($0.07 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program.  

Segment Results  

The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Like most major North American pet food producers, Hills Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations pet food recall in March 2007. Hills took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hills Pet Nutritions annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Companys 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hills Pet Nutritions Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment.  

Operating profit for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 11% to $541.8 in 2008 and increased 9% to $487.8 in 2007. In both years, the increased Operating profit is due to increased sales partially offset by higher agricultural commodities costs and higher advertising spending.  

Corporate   

Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($583.7), ($634.1) and ($670.3) for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Corporate operations include research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets, certain SFAS 88 charges and, in 2007, the impact on Operating profit of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2008 decreased as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, partially offset by higher charges for legal and environmental costs and investment losses.  

Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2007 decreased as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by higher costs resulting from supply chain globalization initiatives implemented under the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and increases in research and development costs and other new product initiatives. In addition, 2007 includes the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the negative impact of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Net sales and volume growth, both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions, are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to

 investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from on-going operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Companys underlying sales trend by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments.  

Worldwide Gross profit margin and Operating profit are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program and other items (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Companys on-going operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation.  

While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Companys business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.  

Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  

2004 Restructuring Program  

The Companys previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of December 31, 2008. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $1,069.2 ($775.5 aftertax). As a result of the program, the Company successfully achieved its objective of streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities as well as centralization of its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives included enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. Savings are estimated to be in the range of $475 and $500 ($350 and $375 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which will increase future cash flows.  

During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks.  

The Company consolidated toothpaste production in Europe, which was previously located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Poland. With the completion of the consolidation project in 2008, toothpaste manufacturing has ceased at the Companys facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Brasov, Romania; Gebze, Turkey and Anzio, Italy. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which was closed. In North America, the Company ceased production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana plant in December 2007 and transferred production of the Companys market-leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility in Morristown,   

21

 Tennessee, and relocated other production and administrative services performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Companys Kansas City, Kansas facility, formerly the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to a U.S. third-party manufacturer.  

In 2006, the Company implemented several other projects, including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re-align organizational resources consistent with its business-building goals. Also consistent with its global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. During 2007 and 2008, the Company continued to exit certain manufacturing activities and to re-align organizational resources in various locations throughout the world, consistent with its business-building goals.  

Charges incurred in connection with the implementation of various projects since inception were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other charges primarily consisted of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $45.5 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $136.6 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives.  

The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana oral care facility; the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Denmark, Puerto Rico, Senegal and Kansas City, Kansas; and the realignment of sales, administrative and research and development functions in various locations around the world.  

Since inception, total charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were as follows: North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (28%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (10%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (21%).  

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows:

Restructuring and implementation-related charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. For 2008, total charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were as follows: North America (26%), Europe/South Pacific (19%), Latin America (1%), Greater Asia/Africa (18%), Pet Nutrition (8%) and Corporate (28%).  

The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and related accrual:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements amounting to $3.0 and $14.1 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities. In 2008 and 2007, Termination benefits also include $0.1 and $2.2, respectively, of charges related to other retiree benefit enhancements and are reflected in Other charges as an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities. In 2008 and 2007, the Company made voluntary contributions of $18.8 and $34.5, respectively, to partially fund this obligation.  

Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that are taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Within Asset impairments, charges are net of gains realized on the sale of assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, Other charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $4.8, and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $66.3. Start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives are expensed as incurred.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Company believes its strong cash-generating capability and financial condition should allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide.  

Cash Flow  

Net cash provided by operations in 2008 was $2,238.3 as compared with $2,203.7 in 2007 and $1,821.5 in 2006. The increase in 2008 reflects the Companys improved profitability and lower spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by increased working capital, higher tax payments and higher voluntary cash contributions to the Companys U.S. postretirement benefit plans.  

The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales in 2008. Inventory and accounts payable and other accruals increased as a result of raw material cost increases and inventory build-up for new product launches and promotional activities. Both days sales outstanding and the inventory days coverage ratio decreased slightly as compared to 2007. Overall, the Companys working capital increased to 2.5% of Net sales in 2008 as compared with 2.2% in 2007.  

With the finalization of the 2004 Restructuring Program, pretax restructuring charges decreased $94.7, and cash spending decreased $23.0 in 2008 relative to the comparable period of 2007. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2008 will be paid out before year end 2009.  

Investing activities used $613.4 of cash during 2008 compared with uses of $528.3 and $620.4 during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in use as compared to 2007 is primarily due to higher capital spending and lower proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines offset by lower payments for acquisitions.  

Capital expenditures were $683.5, $583.1 and $476.4 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increases in capital spending have been primarily due to the 2004 Restructuring Program as well as capacity expansions. Capital spending continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to remain consistent at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales.  

In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $26.5. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc., for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, in 2006 the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95.   

Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain property and non-core product lines. Investing activities in 2008 include $57.5 of proceeds from the sale of certain assets, primarily related to the 2004 Restructuring

 Program. Investing activities in 2007 include $66.5 of net proceeds from the sale of the Companys Latin American household bleach business and $43.2 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities in 2006 include $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Canadian household bleach business.  

Financing activities used $1,465.9 of cash during 2008 compared to $1,754.4 and $1,059.0 during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to higher proceeds from issuance of debt and lower repurchases of common stock, offset by a decrease in exercises of stock options and an increase in principal payments on debt and dividends paid. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and a net reduction of debt.  

Long-term debt increased to $3,676.3 as of December 31, 2008 as compared to $3,360.0 as of December 31, 2007 and total debt increased to $3,783.5 as of December 31, 2008 as compared to $3,515.9 as of December 31, 2007. The Companys long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service.  

At December 31, 2008, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,641.9 and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In August 2008, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its domestic revolving credit facility from $1,500 to $1,600 by adding two banks to the syndicate of banks participating in the revolving credit facility. The facility has an expiration date of November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support the issuance of commercial paper. In May 2008, the Company issued $250 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.2% under the shelf registration statement for the Companys medium-term note program. The Company simultaneously entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the notes to a variable rate based on LIBOR. In May 2008, the Company also issued approximately $75 of forty-year notes at a variable rate based on LIBOR, also under the shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay $100 of medium-term notes with an original maturity of May 2017 and to reduce commercial paper borrowings.  

During 2007, the Company issued 250 million of Euro-denominated medium-term notes maturing in June 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper.  

Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $735.0 and $478.8 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2008 and 2007 were $1,283.8 and $1,151.1, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A-1+ and a Moodys Investors Service rating of P-1. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2012. At December 31, 2008 and 2007 such amounts were $735.0 and $478.8, respectively. While uncertainties in the financial markets so far have not significantly affected the Companys access to credit due to its strong credit rating, future financing could become difficult or more expensive for the Company if market conditions further deteriorate.  

The long-term notes of the Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that are guaranteed by the Company and certain bank borrowings contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote.

Dividend payments in 2008 were $825.2, up from $749.6 in 2007 and $677.8 in 2006. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.56 per share in 2008 from $1.40 per share in 2007 and $1.25 per share in 2006. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments increased to $12.48 per share in 2008 from $11.20 per share in 2007 and $10.00 per share in 2006. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations.  

The Company repurchases its shares of common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. On January 30, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2008 Program) that replaced the Companys previous share repurchase program, which had been approved in 2006. The 2008 Program authorizes the repurchase of up to 30 million shares of the Companys common stock. Aggregate repurchases in 2008 included 13.8 million common shares under both the 2008 Program and the previous share repurchase program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,072.9. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 15.8 million common shares under the previous program and 5.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,269.4. Aggregate repurchases in 2006 included 14.0 million common shares under previous programs and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $884.7.  

The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008:   

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  (1)    Long-term debt due in 2009 includes $735.0 of commercial paper that has been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2008, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused line of credit that expires in 2012.  

  (2)    Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on managements best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.  

  (3)    The Company has outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2008 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.  

  (4)    Long-term liabilities associated with the Companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in Critical Accounting Policies   

26

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

 and Use of Estimates, below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2011. Managements best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2009, is approximately $150, including approximately $30 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $90 of projected contributions to the Companys postretirement plans, most of which are voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plans, as well as approximately $60 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans.  

As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.  

Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure  

The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes.  

As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Companys major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe, Asia/Africa and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging in an effort to minimize the impact of foreign currency rate movements on earnings.  

The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business as well as the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options. These contracts generally have durations no greater than 18 months and are valued using observable forward rates in commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts.  

Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps.  

The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. These contracts generally have durations no greater than 18 months and are valued using quoted commodity exchange prices.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as it is the Companys policy to contract with highly rated diversified counterparties. The Companys consideration of nonperformance risk as it relates to financial instruments includes a review of available market information in addition to published debt ratings, such as probability of default ratings and credit default swap spreads.  

Value at Risk  

The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity-based financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates.  

The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate, foreign exchange rate or commodity-based instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2008 and 2007. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, or commodity-based instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations in 2008 and 2007. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets.  

For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesAn Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), and requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Companys financial statements as of January 1, 2009 and will not have any impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Based on this guidance, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 as they relate to long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangibles, effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of these provisions will not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  

28

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. Certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date. The Company will apply SFAS 141R prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in ownership interest be accounted for as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.  

       Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 780 bps from 56.3% to 48.5% in 2008 and decreased 790 bps and 770 bps in 2007 and 2006, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.  

       The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2008, 2007 and 2006 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.  

29  

Table of Contents 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies.  

       In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans was 6.30%, 6.50% and 5.80% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The discount rate for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.80%, 6.50% and 5.80% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Companys international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 7%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys pension and other postretirement plans.)  

       The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 9% for 2009, declining to 5% by 2015 and will remain at 5% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $5.  

       The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $13.35. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 10%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%.  

       Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge   

30  

Table of Contents 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  

 related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires managements best estimate of net realizable value.  

       The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement.  

       Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.  

       Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.)  

The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.)  

Outlook  

Looking forward into 2009, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. The Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, could impact future operating results.  

While the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact the Companys results in 2009, the Company believes most, if not all, of the impact should be offset over the course of the year. The extent to which the Company is able to offset the effect of the strengthened U.S. dollar will be impacted by the sustainability of benefits from recent commodity cost declines and the Companys ability to successfully implement selling price increases and cost-savings initiatives. Moreover, difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our suppliers, customers and consumers which could, in turn, have an adverse impact on our business.  

Our recent finalization of the 2004 Restructuring Program should enhance our ability to compete successfully in the current environment. As a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company streamlined its global supply chain, reallocated resources to enhance the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Companys other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and markets, new product development, while also supporting an increased level of profitability.

Accordingly, we believe we are well-prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, our experience operating in challenging environments and our continued focus on our strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and our customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. This focus, together with the strength of our global brand names and our broad international presence in both mature and developing markets, should position us well to increase shareholder value over the long-term.
