ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates.  

Credit Risk. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss, economic conditions have significantly impacted the interest income we receive from these investments and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our customersÂ’ ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the depressed economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts is limited because of the diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and in some cases we obtain collateral or other security from our customers.  

Interest Rate and Market Risk. Currently, we do not have any significant assets or obligations with exposure to significant interest rate and market risk.  

Currency Risk. We conduct operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. To minimize the need for foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure, our objective is to manage foreign currency exposure by maintaining a minimal consolidated net asset or net liability position in a currency other than the functional currency.  

We may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of our foreign currency exposures. These exposures may include revenues generated in foreign jurisdictions and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2011.  

In the third quarter of 2009, one of our Canadian operating units entered into three forward contracts with settlement dates in 2009 and 2010, to reduce foreign currency risk associated with anticipated customer sales that were denominated in South African rand. This same operating unit also entered into three additional forward contracts with the same settlement dates to reduce the foreign currency exposure associated with a series of forecasted intercompany payments denominated in U.S. dollars to be made over a twelve-month period. These contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the forward contracts were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) prior to their settlement and were reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions occurred.  

The South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of approximately $11.0 million ($CAD) at origination, and the Canadian dollar to U.S. Dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of approximately $9.5 million (U.S.) at origination. During the year ended December 31, 2010, net losses of $0.4 million were recorded in income in connection with the settled contracts. There were no forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010, and as a result, there is no balance related to the forward contracts in other comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2009, losses of $0.8 million were recorded in income in connection with the settled contracts, and at December 31, 2009, there was $0.4 million in other comprehensive income (loss) related to the forward contracts.
