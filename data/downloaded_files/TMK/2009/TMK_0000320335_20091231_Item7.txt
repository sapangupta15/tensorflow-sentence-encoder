Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Torchmarks Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

How Torchmark Views Its Operations: Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the major insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.  

Insurance Product Line Segments. As fully described in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and benefit administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:  

Premium revenue  

Less:  

 Policy obligations  

 Policy acquisition costs and commissions  

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:  

Net investment income  

Less:  

 Interest credited to net policy liabilities  

 Financing costs  

The tables in Note 13Business Segments reconcile Torchmarks revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ending December 31, 2009. Additionally, this Note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and which reconciles to net income. That summary is reproduced below from the Consolidated Financial Statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business.

Torchmarks operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.  

Summary of Operations: Net income declined $47 million or 10% in 2009 to $405 million. In 2008, net income declined $75 million or 14% to $452 million from $528 million. On a diluted per share basis, 2009 net income fell 5% to $4.88, while in 2008 per share net income declined 7% to $5.11. One major cause for the decline in both years was after-tax realized investment losses, due mostly to writedowns of fixed-maturity securities that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In 2009, after-tax realized investment losses reduced per share earnings $1.12, of which $1.27 per share related to other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities which were offset by $.15 of net gains. In 2008, after-tax losses accounted for $.79 per share, of which $.78 related to other-than-temporary impairments. In 2007, we had realized investment gains which added $.02 to per diluted share earnings, after other-than-temporary impairment writedowns of $.08 per share offset $.10 of other gains for the period. Another contributing factor to the declines in both years was in our health insurance segment, where intense competition in recent periods has resulted in significant declines in agent counts, which in turn has resulted in lower sales of new health products. Health underwriting margins declined $24 million or 12% in 2009 to $170 million, after having decreased $14 million or 7% in 2008.  

Life insurance was our strongest performing segment in both 2009 and 2008, contributing $15 million to pretax growth in both periods. Margin improvements in this segment were primarily a result of premium growth. The investment segment also contributed to the growth in pretax income in 2008, as excess investment income, the measure of profitability of the investment segment, rose $4 million. However, this segments contribution declined $31 million in 2009, as we held significantly more cash in 2009 and as a significant amount of higher-yielding lower-rated investments were sold with the proceeds reinvested in lower-yielding but higher-rated securities in that year. Another factor in the 2009 decline in excess investment income was that we issued $300 million of new 9¼% debt in June and repaid our $99 million 8¼% Senior Debentures which matured in August 2009, resulting in increased financing costs which reduced excess investment income.  

Our annuity margins have fluctuated in recent periods. Our 2008 annuity underwriting loss was $6 million, compared with gains of $3 million in 2009 and $9 million in 2007. In 2008, significant declines  

20  

Table of Contents 

 in equity markets caused variable policyholder account values to decline, guaranteed minimum death benefit costs to increase, policyholders to withdraw funds, and changes in actuarial assumptions all of which resulted in the underwriting losses. As equity markets improved during 2009, many of these factors abated somewhat and margins partially recovered. We do not emphasize this segment and discontinued the sale of variable annuities in 2008, only offering a fixed annuity product.  

Total revenues declined 3% in 2009 to $3.22 billion. In 2008, total revenues declined 5% to $3.33 billion from $3.49 billion in 2007. Life premium rose $43 million in 2009 and $47 million in 2008. Net investment income rose $3 million in 2009 and $23 million in 2008. However, growth in revenues in both 2009 and 2008 were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized investment losses and declines in health premium, described further under this caption.  

Life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending December 31, 2009, rising 3% in 2009 to $1.66 billion and also 3% in 2008. Margins as a percentage of premium have also held steady each year at 27% of premium. Life net sales rose 9% in 2009 to $327 million and 13% in 2008 to $298 million. Life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption Life Insurance.  

We market three primary health insurance products: under-age-65 limited-benefit health insurance, Medicare Supplement insurance, and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Health premium declined 10% in 2009 to $1.02 billion from $1.13 billion in 2008. Health premium declined 9% in 2008. The primary factor in the decreases in both years was the decline in agent count in our United American Branch Office during the year, our largest health producer. This agency has experienced intense competition, which has resulted in a significant decrease in new health sales and has negatively impacted premium income. This agency had historically focused on sales of our limited-benefit health product, as demand for this product had increased. Accordingly, premium from the limited-benefit product grew significantly in relation to Medicare Supplement premium in recent years. However, with the decline in the size of this Agency beginning in 2007, premium for the limited-benefit product has declined. Medicare Supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium, but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product, resulting in premium declines in each successive year. It should be noted, however, that net sales for Medicare Supplement insurance rose in 2009 for the first time in several years. This was a result of the increase in group Medical Supplement sales. We also offer Medicare Part D insurance. As most of the countrys Part D enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006, we do not expect significant growth in our Part D business going forward. See the discussion under Health Insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.  

As noted earlier, we no longer offer variable annuities. While we still offer fixed annuities, we do not emphasize sales of annuity products, favoring life insurance instead. See the caption Annuities for further discussion of the Annuity segment.  

As previously mentioned, the investment segments pretax profitability, or excess investment income, increased $4 million in 2008 but declined $31 million in 2009. Profitability in this segment is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to and assigned to insurance products), and financing costs. In recent years, growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio. One of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested. During these lags, we have held cash at lower yields. Among the most important factors contributing to the relatively lower growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that, due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short term investments during 2009 than we did during 2008 and 2007. Additionally, in 2009, we sold a significant portion of higher-yielding but lower-rated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in lower-yielding but higher-rated bonds in 2009 to improve our risk-adjusted return. This also contributed to reduced net investment income. The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the insurance policy reserves that are supported by the invested assets. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from excess investment income. In 2009, interest expense  

21  

Table of Contents 

 on our long-term debt rose $11 million. During the year we issued our $300 million 9 1/4% Senior Notes but repaid our $99 million 8 1/4% Senior Debentures, resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a higher interest rate. However, this segment has benefited from lower short-term financing costs in each successive year, as these costs have declined primarily due to lower rates on our short-term debt. Prior to 2009, growth in total investment income has been somewhat negatively affected by Torchmarks share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments.  

Torchmarks current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment-grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 92% of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which 94% was investment grade at December 31, 2009. The average quality rating of the portfolio was BBB+. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption Investments in this report and Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment.  

As mentioned earlier in this summary, we wrote down certain securities in each of the years 2007 through 2009, as these securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment. The pretax impairment losses were $160 million, $106 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Please refer to Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments and under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of other-than-temporary impairment. Including the writedowns, we had total after-tax realized investment losses of $93 million in 2009 ($1.12 per share) and $70 million in 2008 ($.79 per share), compared with a $2 million gain in 2007 ($.02 per share). Realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income. Under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report, we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns. Also, as explained in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments.  

During the second quarter of 2009, we issued a new debt security, our 9 1/4% Senior Notes, par value $300 million. Funds from this offering were used to repay our 8 1/4% Senior Debentures which matured in the third quarter of 2009 in the amount of $99 million. We also used $175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes. The regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by rating-agency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios. The subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investment-grade fixed maturities. More information on these transactions can be found in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in our discussion of Capital Resources in this report.  

In each of the years 2007 through 2009, net income was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. A discussion of these items follows.  

As reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Litigation and Tax Settlements, we have been involved in a number of litigation issues over the course of the three year period 2007 through 2009 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses. These issues resulted in after-tax charges of $770 thousand in 2008 and $272 thousand in 2007. Additionally, as described under the same caption of Note 1, we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of $2.9 million in 2009, $10.8 million in 2008, and $1.1 million in 2007. All of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations. Legal and litigation expenses pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses, as appropriate, in our segment analysis. Income from  

22  

Table of Contents 

 litigation settlements is included in other income. As explained in Note 3Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, we wrote down certain company-occupied property to fair value during both 2009 and 2008. The write downs resulted in after-tax charges of $231 thousand in 2009 and $1.4 million in 2008.  

Prior to 2007, Liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings, replacing them with rental facilities. In 2007, 21 buildings were sold for proceeds of $6.4 million and a pretax gain of $4.3 million ($2.8 million after tax). The program began to wind down in 2008 as five buildings were sold for proceeds of $787 thousand and a pretax gain of $278 thousand ($181 thousand after tax). Because of the significant scale of this nonoperating activity, we have removed these amounts from our core results in 2008 and 2007. No buildings were sold in 2009. Five buildings remained to be sold at December 31, 2009.  

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Companys excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. Due to economic conditions at the time, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009. We may resume the program with a reaffirmation by the Board of Directors when share repurchases are determined to be the best use of cash. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009.

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.  

A discussion of each of Torchmarks segments follows.  

Life Insurance. Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2009 life premium representing 62% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72% of the total in 2009. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.  

Throughout 2009, we have been in the process of combining selected United American (UA) Exclusive Agency Branch Offices with the Liberty National Exclusive Agency. For this reason, all premium income and margin data will be reported on a combined basis in this report. However, we will continue to report sales data and agent counts separately.

Life insurance premium rose 3% to $1.7 billion in 2009 after having increased 3% in 2008 to $1.62 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:  

LIFE INSURANCE  

Premium by Distribution Method  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: annualized premium in force, net sales, and first-year collected premium. Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.  

Annualized life premium in force was $1.77 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of 4% over $1.71 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.67 billion at December 31, 2007.

Direct Response is one of our leading writers of life insurance. The Direct Response operation consists of two primary components: direct mail and insert media. Direct mail targets primarily young middle-income households with children. The juvenile life insurance policy is a key product. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders. Parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition- cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. At this time, we believe that the Direct Response unit is the largest U.S. writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance. We expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of Direct Responses premier markets.  

The insert media area targets primarily the adult market. It involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media, such as coupon packets, newspapers, bank statements, and billings. This media was historically placed by Direct Marketing and Advertising Distributors, Inc. (DMAD), previously an unrelated entity which we acquired and integrated their operations into ours during 2007. This acquisition allowed the Company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component.  

The Direct Response operation accounted for 32% of our life insurance premium during 2009, the largest of any distribution group. Life premium for this channel rose 5% in 2009 and 6% in 2008. Net sales rose 7% in 2009 to $132 million after an 8% gain in 2008 to $123 million. First-year collected premium increased 6% in 2009 to $85 million after a 5% gain in 2008.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions, but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales. It is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios. Life premium for this agency rose 7% to $508 million in 2009, after having increased 8% in 2008. Net sales increased 18% in 2009 to $128 million from $108 million in 2008. Net sales rose 17% in 2008. First-year collected premium rose 17% in 2009 to $96 million, after having increased 11% in 2008. As in the case of all of Torchmarks agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. Growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency. The American Income agent count was 4,154 at December 31, 2009 compared with 3,085 a year earlier, an increase of 35%. The agent count rose 21% in 2008 from 2,545 at year end 2007. This agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business. Additionally, the systematic, centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents.  

As previously mentioned, we have combined selected UA Exclusive Agency Branch Offices with the Liberty National Exclusive Agency. The Liberty National Agency has historically marketed life insurance to middle-income customers primarily in the Southeast. The UA Branch Office Agency has historically emphasized health products, but is now changing its focus for newly recruited agents to market Liberty Nationals life and health products. In addition, due to ongoing cuts in Medicare Advantage funding and changes to the competitive environment in the Medicare Supplement market, we have also recently renewed our emphasis on Medicare Supplement sales. Life premium income for this combined agency was  

25  

Table of Contents 

 $298 million for 2009, a 2% decrease compared with $304 million in 2008. Life premium for this agency declined 2% in 2008 from 2007. First-year collected premium on a combined basis rose 6% to $35 million in 2009, after having increased 8% in 2008.  

Liberty Nationals net sales declined 5% to $46 million in 2009, after having increased 31% a year earlier. The Liberty Agency had 1,740 producing agents at December 31, 2009, compared with 3,369 a year earlier, a decline of 48%. The agent count at Liberty had increased 40% in 2008 from 2,410. The 2009 decrease in agent count was due primarily to agent compensation issues. A two-tier bonus threshold proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated. Management reverted to a level bonus threshold during the third quarter of 2009. In addition, due to deteriorating first year persistency rates on business written over the past several quarters, management modified compensation incentives in the third quarter of 2009 to place more emphasis on retention. This has resulted in the departure of some of the weaker agents. Management expects the counts to increase in 2010.  

The UA Branch Office Agency produced net sales of $9.2 million in 2009 of Liberty Nationals life products. As noted earlier, this Agency traditionally focused on health product sales. Due to intense competition in recent periods in the health insurance market, the UA Branch has experienced sharp declines in agent count. The UA Branch Office Agency had 731 producing agents at December 31, 2009, compared with 1,651 agents a year earlier, a decline of 56%. The count declined 45% in 2008 from 2,979 agents.  

As is the case with all of our captive agency forces, growing the number of productive agents is critical to the growth in sales. As mentioned above, we have shifted the emphasis in the UA Branch Office Agency to life and health products currently marketed by Liberty National agents, as well as a renewed focus on Medicare Supplement products. These products are priced to achieve higher profit margins and have better persistency than the UA Branchs limited-benefit health insurance. This Agency will continue to offer the current product portfolio, but the majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage new agents to sell the Liberty National product line along with the renewed focus on UA Medicare Supplement products. We believe this will improve the stability and profitability of the UA Branch Office Agency.  

We also offer life insurance through Other Agencies consisting of the United Investors Agency, the Military Agency, the United American Independent Agency, and other small miscellaneous sales agencies. The United Investors Agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business. United Investors represented 4% of Torchmarks 2009 life premium income. The Military Agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 12% of life premium. The United American Independent Agency represented less than 2% of Torchmarks total life premium. This agency is focused on health insurance, with life sales being incidental.

Table of Contents 

Gross margins, as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 4% in 2009 to $447 million after also rising 4% in 2008. As a percentage of life insurance premium, gross margins have been stable each year at 27%. Margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth.  

Health Insurance. Health products sold by Torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited-benefit cancer, accident plans, and hospital/surgical plans sold to people under age 65. We also sell Medicare Supplements to enrollees in the Federal Medicare program, as well as providing coverage under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. The limited-benefit health plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined, a fixed-amount surgical schedule, outpatient coverage, and other miscellaneous hospital-related charges. They also contain caps on total per-illness benefits. Consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major-medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers. Minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited-benefit plans are generally lower than those of Medicare Supplement; however, the Medicare Supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates, resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium. In recent years, sales of the under-age-65 limited-benefit product have exceeded Medicare Supplement sales, as customers demand for the limited-benefit product increased and price competition and reduced demand for Medicare Supplements dampened sales of that product. However, Medicare Supplement continues to be our largest health product in terms of premium income. Additionally, in the past two years, Medicare Supplement sales have grown steadily in relation to limited-benefit sales, due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below.

Table of Contents 

Total health premium represented 38% of Torchmarks total premium income in 2009. Excluding Part D premium, health premium represented 33% in 2009, compared with 37% in 2008 and 39% in 2007. Health underwriting margin, excluding Part D, accounted for 25% of the total in 2009, compared with 29% in 2008 and 30% in 2007. These declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment. Health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

 *   Total Medicare Part D premium and health premium exclude $7.3 million in 2007 and $2.5 million in 2009 of risk-sharing premium paid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services consistent with the Medicare Part D contract. In 2008, $122 thousand of risk-sharing premium was received, increasing premium. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Health insurance, excluding Medicare Part D. As noted under the caption Life Insurance, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to lifes superior margins and other benefits. Our health distribution groups have also encountered increased competition in recent periods. The increased competition has led to losses in agents in our UA Branch Office and Independent Agencies. Agent turnover has increased as lower premium, lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell. Declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales, which in turn have pressured premium growth. Health premium, excluding Part D premium, fell 12% to $837 million in 2009, after declining 8% in 2008. Medicare Supplement premium declined 6% to $458 million in 2009, compared with a 7% decline in 2008. Other limited-benefit health premium dropped 18% in 2009 to $378 million, after a decline of 9% in 2008. Net sales, excluding Medicare Part D, declined 30% to $97 million in 2009. Net sales fell 42% in 2008 to $139 million. Medicare Supplement net sales rose 64% in 2009, however, while other health net sales declined 54%. In 2008, both Medicare Supplement and other health net sales declined, Medicare Supplement declined 14% and other limited-benefit health fell 46%. First year collected premium also declined significantly in both 2009 and 2008.  

While new sales of our limited-benefit health products have been stronger than our Medicare Supplement plans, Medicare Supplement net sales have been gaining in recent periods in relation to

 other limited-benefit products. Medicare Supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium, representing 55% of non-Part D health premium in 2009. Because Medicare Supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited-benefit products, Medicare Supplement premium grew to 55% in relative proportion to limited-benefit premium in 2009 compared with 51% for the two prior years.  

As previously mentioned under the caption Life Insurance, we have combined selected UA Exclusive Agency Branch Offices with the Liberty National Exclusive Agency. This combination has resulted in this Agency being Torchmarks largest in terms of health premium income and net sales. In 2009, this Agency represented 46% of all Torchmark non-Part D income health premium at $389 million. The UA Branch has historically been Torchmarks largest health distributor, marketing limited-benefit health products and Medicare Supplements. Liberty also markets limited-benefit products, concentrating on cancer insurance. In 2009, health premium income of $389 million in the combined Agency declined 18% from prior year premium of $476 million. Premium also fell 10% in 2008 from $528 million. First-year collected premium fell 62% to $33 million in 2009, after declining 36% a year earlier. As noted earlier, increased competition in the health insurance market has caused declines in agent counts particularly in the UA Branch Agency. The decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales, translating into declines in premium. The UA Branch Office net sales for 2009 declined 75% from $72 million in 2008 to $18 million (of which $5 million was for sales of Liberty National products in 2009). In 2008, this Agencys net sales fell 56%. As discussed under the caption Life Insurance, the UA Branch Office agent count has fallen significantly each year, 45% in 2008 to 1,651 agents and 56% in 2009 to 731 agents. These declines have negatively impacted net sales and premium growth. This effect has been more notable in Torchmarks health segment as this Agency is a more prominent factor in our health operations. Also discussed under the Life Insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this Agency.  

Libertys health net sales were relatively flat in 2009, but rose 22% to $12 million in 2008 on sales of limited-benefit health products, primarily cancer. Libertys net sales as a portion of total non-Part D health net sales rose from 4% in 2007 to 9% in 2008 to 13% in 2009.  

The UA Independent Agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose size range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies, of which 1,872 were active producing agents for Torchmark at December 31, 2009. This agency is our largest carrier of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $266 million or 58% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2009. This agencys relative contribution to Torchmarks total health sales has increased in each of the past three years. Net sales for this Agency rose 14% to $43 million in 2009. Medicare Supplement net sales of $30 million more than doubled in 2009 over net sales of $15 million in 2008 and almost doubled sales of $16 million in 2007. These increases in 2009 were due to increases in group Medicare Supplement sales. Total health premium income for the UA Independent Agency was $326 million in 2009, a 9% decline from 2008 premium of $357 million. Premium income declined 8% in 2008 from 2007. The declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency, also predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, is our third largest health insurance distributor based on 2009 premium collected. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans for which approximately 69% of the agencys 2009 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.  

Health premium at this agency rose 2% in 2009 to $75 million, after having increased 4% to $73 million in 2008. Net health sales were $13 million in 2009, compared with $12 million in 2008 and $11 million in 2007. Net health sales comprised less than 10% of the American Income Agencys total net sales in 2009.  

Direct Response, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups. In 2009, net health sales were $11 million, comprising approximately 8% of Direct Responses total life and health net sales. Direct Response health net sales and premium income have risen each year over the prior year. Net sales increased 87% in 2009 and 7% in 2008. Health premium rose 3% in 2009 to $47 million and 7% in 2008.  

Medicare Part D. Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, began offering insurance coverage under the governments Medicare Part D plan as of January 1, 2006. The Medicare Part D plan  

31  

Table of Contents 

 is a stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for participating private insurers like United American, unlike the traditional Medicare program for hospital and doctor services, where CMS is the primary insurer and private Medicare Supplement insurers are secondary insurers. The program generally calls for CMS to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured Medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium. Total Medicare Part D premium was $184 million in 2009, compared with $176 million in 2008 and $215 million in 2007. Changes in Part D premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees. Enrollment for all Part D coverages ends on December 31 of the previous year, except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year. At December, 2009, United American had approximately 158 thousand enrollees for the 2010 Part D plan, compared with 147 thousand for the 2009 plan year and 158 thousand for the 2008 plan year. Our Medicare Part D product is sold primarily through the Direct Response operation, but is also sold by the UA Independent agency. Part D net sales were $43 million in 2009, compared with $28 million in 2008 and $25 million in 2007. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales, and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees.  

We believe that the Medicare Part D program is a meaningful component to our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior-age market and with Medicare Supplements, the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for participating insurers, the incremental income added to our health insurance margins, and the renewal of the business every year. Due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, we do not expect significant growth in the Part D product in the near future, as most Medicare beneficiaries have already chosen a plan. Additionally, as with any government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.

In 2008, $122 thousand of risk-sharing premium was received, increasing premium. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Torchmarks health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined 12% in 2009 to $170 million. Health margin declined 7% to $195 million in 2008 from $208 million in 2007. As a percentage of premium income, margins were stable in all periods at approximately 17%.  

Annuities. Fixed annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries. Variable annuities were sold prior to 2008 but new sales were discontinued during that year. Annuities represented less than 1% of Torchmarks 2009 premium revenue and underwriting income. We do not emphasize this segment.

 *   A significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements. This spread sometimes results in negative net policy obligations.  

Variable annuities generate earnings from periodic policy charges and fees to the account balances, reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs. Instability and declines in equity markets over the past two years have had a significant negative effect on the average variable annuity policyholder account balance, especially in 2008, as market volatility has resulted in declines in the value of the underlying investments and caused increased policyholder withdrawals. As noted above, we also withdrew from the variable annuity market in 2008 and no longer market these products. These events have pressured annuity revenues and accordingly underwriting income in 2009 and particularly in 2008.

Table of Contents 

Underwriting income on our variable business has been recently affected by two major factors other than policy charges. Our products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits providing a minimum death benefit regardless of policyholder account value upon death. For this reason, we provide a reserve for this benefit, the cost of which increases as the policyholder account value declines. Additionally, because of changes in the account balance size, we expect that future revenues and profits will also change accordingly. Therefore, the projections with regard to the deferred acquisition costs associated with this business are revised, resulting in a charge or credit to reflect this revision or true-up of the projections. Because equity markets declined significantly in the latter part of 2008, the guaranteed death benefit and the true-up related to deferred acquisition costs increased substantially in 2008, from $935 thousand in 2007 to $13.6 million. As a result of the partial recovery of the equity markets in 2009, the charge to underwriting income for the guaranteed death benefit reserve adjustment and true-up adjustment was reduced to $1.7 million. The variable annuity business is our only business where revenue and margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets.  

While the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year, policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly. The stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size. These charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. In 2009, investment income for fixed annuities increased as a result of the assignment of higher-yielding new investments to this product as older lower-yielding investments matured and rolled off over time. As the income has grown at a greater rate than the fund balance, the spread has widened. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits.  

Administrative expenses. Operating expenses are included in the Other and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2009.  

Operating Expenses Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

Insurance administrative expenses declined 3% in 2009, after having risen 3% in 2008. As a percentage of premium, they declined to 5.7% in 2009, after having risen from 5.5% in 2007 to 5.8% in 2008. In 2009, increases in salaries were more than offset by declines in other administrative costs and other employee costs. As a result of the effort to achieve greater consistency in expense classification among our subsidiaries, we deferred $12 million more of deferrable administrative expense to acquisition expense in 2009 compared with 2008. These reductions in administrative expense were partially offset by increases in pension and other employee benefit costs during the period. The additional deferred costs will increase the amortization of acquisition costs in future periods. The 2008 increase was primarily a result of higher salary expenses, pension costs, and other costs such as postage and property taxes. The 2008 increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses and Medicare Part D administrative expense. Management believes that pension cost will stabilize in 2010, because of the partial recovery in financial markets.  

Parent company expense was lower in 2009 than in the two prior periods. Included in 2008 and 2007 expenses were charges in the amount of $2.9 million in 2008 and $1.6 million in 2007 for expenses incurred related to potential acquisition bids that were not successful.  

As mentioned in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we settled litigation in prior periods relating to issues occurring many years ago, but incurred $2.5 million in legal costs in 2008 and $933 thousand in 2007. As previously noted, we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations. Stock compensation expense declined in 2009, primarily as a result of the lower stock price caused by the severe market decline in 2009 and the effect it had on values at the time of our annual stock and stock option grants for 2009. Expense related to the new 2009 grants replaced the expense for costlier older grants that became fully vested. Stock compensation expense rose in 2008 because 2008 was the first year after adoption of the accounting rule requiring the expensing of stock options where we had three years of annual employee grants being expensed (2005, 2006 and 2008). The 2004 employee grant was fully vested in 2005 (before adoption) and there was no grant in 2007. New restricted stock grants in each of the three years 2006 through 2008, which generally vest over five years, have also contributed to the increases in 2008 and 2007 stock compensation expense. Management believes that stock compensation expense will increase slightly in 2010. As stated in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense. As described in Note 3Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, we wrote down certain Company-occupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, we incurred a pretax charge of $2.1 million in 2008 and $355 thousand in 2009 which is included in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the respective year.  

Investments. We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs. We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used $4.0 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess investment income decreased $31 million or 9% in 2009 over the prior year. Excess investment income rose $4 million or 1% in 2008. On a per diluted share basis, 2009 excess investment income declined 4% to $3.58. Share purchases caused the decline in per share excess investment income in 2009 to be less than the decline in total excess investment income and the increase in per share excess investment income to be greater than the increase in total excess investment income in 2007 and 2008. Per share excess investment income increased 10% in 2008 and 7% in 2007.  

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 1% to $675 million in 2009. It increased 3.5% to $671 million in 2008 from $649 million in 2007. As presented in the following chart, the growth in net investment income in all periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

One of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested. One of the most important factors contributing to the relatively lower growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that, due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short term investments during 2009 than we did during 2008 and 2007. Had we not done so, and if short term investment rates had not been much lower during 2009 than in 2008, the growth rate in investment income during 2009 would have been approximately the same as the growth rate in mean assets.

Excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt. Information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table.  

Interest Credited to Net Insurance Policy Liabilities  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *   Revised from previously reported to exclude the unrealized gains and losses on deferred acquisition costs.  

The average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years. In 2001, as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions, we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points (1%) on policies issued after January 1, 2001. As this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business, the average crediting rate will continue to increase. For more specific information on life and health crediting rates, please refer to Note 5Future Policy Benefit Reserves in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the Consolidated Statements of Operations to financing costs.

The table below presents the components of financing costs.  

Analysis of Financing Costs  

(Amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Financing costs rose $7 million or 11% in 2009. They declined $4 million or 6% in 2008. The 2009 increase in financing costs reflects the issuance in June 2009 of $300 million principal amount 9 ¼% Senior Notes due in 2019 and the maturity in August 2009 of $99 million principal amount 8 ¼% Senior Debentures. Short-term interest expense was $4 million lower in 2009, as a result of significantly lower interest rates when compared with 2008. The 2008 decline resulted from a decrease in short-term interest rates during 2008, as well as a 4% decline in our average commercial paper balance for the year to $229 million.  

Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates.  

Investment Acquisitions. Torchmarks current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities (maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, new money is invested short-term, generally with maturities less than five years. During calendar years 2007 through 2009, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities. Investments were primarily made in corporate securities, although some municipal bonds were acquired in 2007 and 2009. There were virtually no below-investment-grade securities acquired and the average rating of investments acquired in each year was A. Investment-grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust-preferred securities (which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks) with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors.

Table of Contents 

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the worst call date. Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date.  

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not (and if so, when) the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment. However, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.  

During 2007 and 2008, we invested considerable funds in fixed-maturity securities (bonds, trust preferred securities, and redeemable preferred stocks) with longer scheduled maturity dates, often exceeding 30 years. In virtually all cases, such securities have a scheduled maturity date and are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date. Because of the changing investment environment later in 2009, we were able to achieve our yield and quality objectives with investments in securities with somewhat shorter average lives and maturities. As a result, the average life of funds invested during 2009 (to both next call and maturity) was somewhat lower than that of investments during 2007 and 2008.  

New cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years, especially 2007. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds available for investment, but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $181 million in 2009, $238 million in 2008, and $848 million in 2007. The 2007 level of calls was unusual, and contributed to the significant increase in funds invested in that year. The higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below.

Table of Contents 

Sales transactions. As disclosed in Note 3Investments, the Company sold $758 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost in the third quarter of 2009, including $315 million of below- investment-grade securities. The market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where, even though the sales price was less than amortized cost, management determined that better risk-adjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities. Other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes. Due in large part to selling below-investment-grade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investment-grade securities, below-investment-grade securities as a percentage of total fixed maturities at amortized cost declined from 13% at June 30, 2009 to 8% at December 31, 2009. The reduction in below-investment-grade securities had a positive impact on the risk-based capital position of our insurance subsidiaries.  

Portfolio Analysis. Because Torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmarks components of invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2009 with the latest industry data.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2009, approximately 93% of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed-maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, made up an additional 4%. The remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities, mortgage loans, and other long-term and short-term investments.

Because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities. An analysis of our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 is as follows:

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2009, fixed maturities had a fair value of $9.7 billion, compared with $7.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Net unrealized losses on fixed maturities declined from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008 to $456 million at December 31, 2009. Approximately 74% of our fixed maturity assets at December 31, 2009 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 14% were redeemable preferred stocks. This compares with 78% corporate bonds and 15% redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2008. At December 31, 2009, less than 2% of the assets at amortized cost were residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The $55 million of CDOs at amortized cost made up less than 1% of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. The $22 million of mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA. For more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2009 and 2008, including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Additional information concerning the fixed-maturity portfolio is as follows.  

Fixed Maturity Portfolio Selected Information

Credit Risk Sensitivity. Credit risk is the level of certainty that a securitys issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 89% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors.  

The following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2009, approximately 38% of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost (34% at fair value) were in the financial sector, including 17% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 16% in banks at amortized cost. Financial guarantors, mortgage insurers, and insurance brokers comprised approximately 2% of the portfolio. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 14% of the portfolio at amortized cost. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 266 issuers in a wide variety of sectors. As previously noted, gross unrealized losses were $723 million at December 31, 2009, declining from $1.9 billion a year earlier. Approximately 60% of the decrease in net unrealized loss was attributable to improvements in valuations in non-financial sectors since year-end 2008 and 40% was due to a partial recovery in the net unrealized loss position of our financial holdings. As discussed in Note 3Investments, we believe much of the unrealized losses in recent periods were attributable to illiquidity in the financial markets. We expect to recover the full book value of our investments in impaired securities.  

As shown in the table above, the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was greater than 50% for our investments in CDOs and the financial guarantor/mortgage insurer (monoline insurer) sectors. We evaluated each of the impaired securities in these and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of  

44

 the impairments were other-than-temporary. Certain information about our evaluation of the impaired securities in the CDO and monoline insurer sectors is provided in the following paragraphs.  

At December 31, 2009, we held investments in five different CDOs. In our opinion, our investments in four of these CDOs ($34 million amortized cost and $13 million fair value) were other-than-temporarily impaired and our investment in one CDO ($21 million amortized cost and $5 million fair value) was not other-than-temporarily impaired. In reaching this conclusion, we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers for each of these CDOs the current status of the collateral underlying our investments, the credit events (defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral) experienced to date, and the possibility of future credit events. We calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience. We reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events would have on our expected future cash flows. We calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate. While there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations, we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions.  

Also at December 31, 2009, we held investments issued by five different monoline insurers. In our opinion, our investments in three of these monoline insurers ($9 million amortized cost and $10 million fair value) were other-than-temporarily impaired and our investments in two monoline insurers ($83 million amortized cost and $37 million fair value) were not other-than-temporarily impaired. We collected and analyzed a significant amount of information to form opinions about the reasons for the severity of our impairments, including the illiquidity of some of our holdings (and its impact on fair values), the expected future experience in the mortgage market, and the reasonable expectation of the receipt of all future contractual interest and principal payments for these investments. We reviewed news and information about the economy and the mortgage market in general and about the issuers of our investments. We reviewed and analyzed financial statements and had discussions with sell-side and independent credit analysts who follow this sector, certain regulators, and members of the management teams of some of the issuers of our investments. While there is a possibility that future experience in the mortgage markets will differ from our current expectations, we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions.  

At December 31, 2009, our internal rating for a security was determined as the average of the securitys rating from four nationally recognized rating agencies. The ratings from each agency are evenly weighted when calculating the average, and the average is rounded to the nearest rating when it is between two ratings. In prior years, the average was rounded down to the next lower rating when it was between two ratings. The ratings methodology was changed in 2009 to more accurately reflect the average ratings of the securities and to make ratings by category be more consistent with the statutory ratings which are instrumental in determining the regulatory required capital for our insurance subsidiaries. Under the new rating methodology, below-investment-grade bonds would have been 6% of the fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2008 at amortized cost, compared with 7% based on the prior rating methodology.

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of BBB+ based on amortized cost. Approximately 92% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2009, we had $18 million at fair value ($55 million book value) invested in CDOs, for which the composite rating at that date was CC. The collateral underlying these CDOs is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies, but no sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages are included in the collateral.  

Our current investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.

Market Risk Sensitivity. Torchmarks financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the companys investment portfolio. Since 93% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.  

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.  

Because our investment portfolio is large and diverse, investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.  

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

   *   Written down due to other-than-temporary impairment.  

As described in Note 3Investments under the caption Other-than temporary impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2007 through 2009 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in Note 3 and in our Critical Accounting Policies in this report. The writedowns resulted in pretax charges of $160 million in 2009 ($105 million after tax), $106 million in 2008 ($69 million after tax), and $11 million in 2007 ($7 million after tax). The 2009 charge included $83 million on CDOs ($55 million after tax) and $36 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers ($23 million after tax). The remaining writedowns in 2009 were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds. In 2008, the significant bonds written down were Lehman Brothers bonds of $74 million pretax ($48 million after tax) and Washington Mutual bonds of $19 million pretax ($12 million after tax). Other writedowns in 2008 included perpetual preferred stocks of Federal National Mortgage Association and certain non-financial securities. Impairment losses on fixed maturities in 2007 were related to non-financial institution holdings.  

Additionally, as described in Note 3, we wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in 2008, resulting in a loss of $1.1 million ($718 thousand after tax). We wrote down an additional $205 thousand ($133 thousand after tax) in 2009 on this investment.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Liquidity. Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.  

The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes.  

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity. The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis.  

Parent Company Liquidity. An important source of cash flow to the parent company is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries noted above. These dividends are used to pay Parent Company dividends on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent. In 2009, $355 million in dividends were paid to the Parent Company, as compared with $404 million in 2008 and $458 million in 2007. After paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2009 of approximately $281 million. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2010, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive $360 million in dividends from subsidiaries and that approximately $270 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of Note 11Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company.  

An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. As of December 31, 2009, we had available $167 million under this facility. For a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility, see the Commercial Paper section of Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

During the first half of 2009 until early June, Torchmark qualified for and participated in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), a facility created by the Federal Reserve Board to purchase commercial paper from eligible issuers. One condition of participation was that we maintain our commercial paper credit ratings. As of June 5, 2009, one agency downgraded our commercial paper facility by one notch. As a result, we no longer qualified to issue commercial paper in the CPFF after that date. However, the Company has been able to issue commercial paper in the public market since that time at a considerably lower cost than through the government program. We issued over one billion dollars of commercial paper during the second half of 2009 at an average yield of 0.6%, compared with an average yield of 1.7% during the first half of 2009 which was primarily issued under the CPFF. The downgrade has not had an impact on our ability to access public commercial paper markets.  

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2010 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, a short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.

Table of Contents 

Consolidated Liquidity. Consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $976 million in 2009, compared with $731 million in 2008, and $850 million in 2007. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies have received $243 million in investment calls and tenders and $518 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2009. Maturities, tenders, and calls totaled $581 million in 2008 and $1.3 billion in 2007.  

Our cash and short-term investments were $590 million at year-end 2009 and $177 million at year-end 2008. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $9.7 billion at December 31, 2009. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As fully described and discussed in Note 10Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the subcaption Funded Debt, Torchmark had outstanding $120 million (par amount) 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders. The trust is an off-balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with GAAP rules. Deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest. Therefore Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity, even though we own all of the entitys voting equity and have guaranteed the entitys performance. While these liabilities are not on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, they are represented by Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust. These Junior Subordinated Debentures were a Torchmark liability of $124 million par and book value at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. These securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption Capital Resources in this report. The 7.1% preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 7.1% interest payment on our debt to the trusts. As described in Note 14Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the Trust Preferred shareholders.  

As a part of its above-mentioned credit facility, Torchmark has outstanding $200 million in stand-by letters of credit. However, these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole.  

As of December 31, 2009, we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities other than as described above. All of our guarantees, other than the Trust Preferred guarantee, were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 14Commitments and Contingencies.

 (2) Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (5) Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at December 31, 2009. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.  

Capital Resources. Torchmarks capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), long-term funded debt, Junior Subordinated Debentures supporting its Trust Preferred Securities, and shareholders equity. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are payable to Torchmarks Capital Trust III which is liable for its Trust Preferred Securities. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are included in Due to affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The carrying value of the funded debt was $920 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $722 million a year earlier. Our 8 1/4 % Senior Debentures matured and were repaid in August, 2009 at a redemption amount of $99 million plus accrued interest. At year end 2008, they were classified as short-term debt because they were due within a year. As a result, reported long-term debt at December 31, 2008 was $499 million.  

As fully explained in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June of 2009 we issued $300 million principal amount of 9¼% Senior Notes due in 2019 for proceeds of $296 million. As noted above, a portion of these proceeds were used to repay the $99 million due upon the August, 2009 maturity of our 8¼% Senior Debentures. Of the $197 million balance of the proceeds, $175 million was contributed to our insurance subsidiaries in 2009. The subsidiaries then in turn invested these funds in investment-grade corporate bonds and municipal bonds. The capital contributions were made as a result of our desire to maintain subsidiary regulatory capital at levels adequate to meet the requirements of rating agencies.  

Poor economic conditions experienced during 2009 caused the ratings of many bonds in our insurance subsidiaries portfolios to be downgraded and have also resulted in increased other-than-  

51  

Table of Contents 

 temporary impairments taken. Because of the large volume of ratings downgrades and impairments, these items have had a significant negative effect on the subsidiaries regulatory capital. The subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 300% of required regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 300% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. RBC has been favorably impacted by these capital contributions and the sales of below-investment-grade securities discussed under the caption InvestmentsSales Transactions in this report. At December 31, 2009, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios in excess of 350%. Should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future and the ratio falls below 300%, management could utilize cash on hand at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 300%.  

Due to its strong liquidity and capital position, Torchmark has no intent at this point in time to issue equity, and, in fact, has recently declared an increase in its dividend on it common stock from $.14 to $.15 per share each quarter. As noted under the caption Highlights in this report, we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely in March, 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time. Reactivation of this program is subject to Board approval. No share purchases have been made since March, 2009. However, we did acquire 2 million shares at a cost of $47 million ($22.78 per share) in the first quarter of 2009 under the program. Share purchases in 2008 and 2007 were more significant, as we acquired 8 million shares for $427 million in 2008 and 6 million shares in 2007 for $402 million under the program. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption Highlights in this report.  

Shareholders equity was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2008. During the twelve months since December 31, 2008, shareholders equity was reduced by the $47 million in share purchases but has been increased by a reduction of $819 million of net unrealized losses after tax in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved. As explained in Note 3Investmentsunrealized loss analysis, unrealized losses in 2008 and early 2009 have resulted primarily from illiquidity in the financial markets in recent periods as a result of general economic conditions.  

We plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so. Excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies. As mentioned previously, our share repurchase program was suspended in the first quarter of 2009 due to general economic conditions at the time. The program could be resumed with approval by the Board of Directors if share repurchases are determined to be the best use of excess cash.  

Historically, management has felt that share purchases have been beneficial to the Company. We believe that Torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings and to return on equity, and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value. As noted earlier in this report, we acquired over 2 million shares at a cost of $47 million in 2009 with excess cash flow. In 2008, a much more significant purchase of 7.6 million shares at a cost of $427 million was made. In 2008, if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds, an estimated $11 million of additional investment income, after tax, would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have declined 9% to $4.99. Because share purchases were made, actual net income per share was $5.11, a lesser decline of 7%. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year.  

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our  

52  

Table of Contents 

 shareholders equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. More recently, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio has been depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity resulting in a significant decrease in shareholders equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.  

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmarks capital structure.  

Selected Financial Data

 * Amount added to (deducted from) comprehensive income to produce the stated GAAP item  

 **  Includes Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2009, 2008, and 2007 in the amount of $124 million.  

 *** Torchmarks debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio.  

Effective in 2008, the FASB issued new guidance, offering an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we have not elected this option.  

As discussed earlier in this report, the fixed maturity portfolio incurred $1.8 billion in net unrealized investment losses in 2008 ($1.1 billion after tax and adjustments of deferred acquisition costs). These unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets, and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders equity in 2008. In 2009, as conditions in financial markets have begun to improve, unrealized losses have declined $1.3 billion  

53

 ($.9 billion after tax). Torchmarks ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 9.7 times in 2009, compared with 11.5 times in 2008 and 12.8 times in 2007. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption Investments in this report.  

Credit Ratings. The credit quality of Torchmarks debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies. In 2008, Moodys affirmed our credit ratings. In 2009, however, they modified their outlook on our Senior Debt from stable to negative. They cited their expectation of rising asset losses as well as tighter liquidity and reduced financial flexibility. In 2008, Standard & Poors affirmed all credit ratings on Torchmark and its subsidiaries. However, it revised its outlook to negative from stable for the Company. Standard & Poors cited our increased risk within our investment portfolio which had experienced significant unrealized losses concentrated in the financial sector. They also noted that our share repurchase program has reduced our capitalization, but that we were still well within a level adequate to support their rating. During 2007, Standard & Poors lowered its credit rating on Torchmarks outstanding debt from A+ to A, and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from A- to BBB+. The credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity, recruiting, and retention, as well as changes in direct response strategy, all of which have contributed to lower new sales. During 2009, A.M. Best affirmed our funded debt rating at a-, but downgraded our preferred stock from bbb+ to bbb. They also revised their outlook to negative on the funded debt. Also in 2009, Fitch downgraded our Senior Debt from A to BBB+ (two notches), our preferred stock from A- to BBB (two notches), and our commercial paper from F1 to F2 (one notch). Fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of Torchmarks insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries investment portfolios. They also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the Parent Company from the subsidiaries, the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil, and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward. Fitch had previously revised its outlook to negative from stable in 2008 and maintained the negative outlook in 2009. The chart below presents Torchmarks credit ratings as of December 31, 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In January, 2010, Fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to BBB-. At that time, Fitch downgraded over 200 hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities, as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed.  

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by Standard & Poors and A.M. Best. In 2009, A.M. Best affirmed the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. In 2007, Standard & Poors lowered its financial strength rating of United Investors to A from A+ and the ratings of Liberty, Globe, United American and American Income from AA to AA-, as a result of an expected lag in new business sales in the short term. The following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2009.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A.M. Best states that it assigns A+ (Superior) ratings to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. The A.M. Best A (Excellent) rating is assigned to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A (Excellent) companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.  

54  

Table of Contents 

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poors Corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category. The A rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics, somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings.  

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES  

Information regarding related party transactions is found in Note 15Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

OTHER ITEMS  

Litigation. Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims that are tried in Alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages (including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to Note 14Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

NEW UNADOPTED ACCOUNTING RULES  

The FASB has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to Torchmark, effective in future periods:  

Transfers of Financial Assets: This guidance, effective for Torchmark as of January 1, 2010, amends previous guidance concerning transfers of financial assets to disallow the use of qualifying special purpose entities. Such entities are required to be evaluated for consolidation. Torchmark has no such entities and does not expect any impact from adoption.  

Variable Interest Entities: This new guidance, effective for Torchmark as of January 1, 2010, amends previous guidance concerning variable interest entities, modifying the determination of the primary beneficiary, and requiring ongoing assessment of primary beneficiary status of the variable interest entity for consolidation purposes. At present, the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on Torchmark. While the trust that holds Torchmarks 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities is a variable interest entity, and Torchmark has 100% voting control, Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we will not consolidate the trust under the new guidance, following the same treatment as in current practice.  

Fair Value Disclosures: New guidance has been issued concerning disclosures about the fair value of financial assets. This guidance will require us to separately disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as we currently only disclose transfers in and out of Level 3. The point at which the transfer is recognized must be disclosed. All purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of Level 3 assets must be reported on a gross basis, contrary to our previous permitted practice of reporting on a net basis. A more detailed disclosure of classes of investments will be required, although Torchmark currently complies with the required level of detail. Valuation techniques for Level 2 and Level 3 assets must be fully disclosed. The new guidance will be effective for Torchmark beginning January 1, 2010, except for the detail breakout (gross up) of Level 3 assets which is effective beginning January 1, 2011. Prior period comparisons are not required in the initial adoption periods. Early adoption is permitted.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Future Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note 5Future Policy Benefit Reserves.  

Approximately 72% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2009 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Future Policy Benefits. Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. A premium deficiency event for Torchmarks traditional business is very rare, and did not occur during the three years ended December 31, 2009.  

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, whereby the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.  

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased. The costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales. Additionally, the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption Value of Insurance Purchased as indicated in Note 4Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Approximately 95% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2009 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked-in at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2009.  

The remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. With the exception of variable annuities, as discussed earlier in this report, revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2009. The variable annuity block could sustain further increases in the level of amortization if equity markets were to decline. Amortization for deposit business is not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future.  

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable. This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of  

56  

Table of Contents 

 policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.  

Revenue Recognition. Premium income from our subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is due. However, in accordance with GAAP, revenues on limited-payment contracts and universal life-type contracts (deposit balance products) are recognized differently. Revenues on limited-payment contracts are recognized over the contract period. Premium for deposit balance products, such as our annuity and interest-sensitive life policies, is added to the policy account value. The policy account value (or deposit balance) is a Torchmark liability. This deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance, administration, surrender, and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder. In each case, benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned.  

We report investment income as revenue, less investment expenses, when it is earned. Our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations. Because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested. Anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and discussions under the captions Annuities, Investments, and Market Risk Sensitivity in this report.  

Valuation of Fixed Maturities: We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption Market Risk Sensitivity in this report. However, as discussed under the caption Financial Condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.  

During recent periods, the values of our fixed maturities have also been affected by illiquidity in the financial markets, which has contributed to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in Note 3Investments under the caption Fair Value Measurements.  

Impairment of Investments. We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussions under the  

57  

Table of Contents 

 captions Investments and Realized Gains and Losses in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.  

Defined benefit pension plans. We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2009, our net liability under these plans was $30 million.  

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. Our discount rate, rate of return on assets, and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in Note 9Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. Note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.  

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS  

We caution readers regarding certain forward-looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document, and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any statement that is not a historical fact, or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business, whether express or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement. Such statements represent our opinions concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.  

Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to:  

1) Changes in lapse rates and/or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions;  

2) Federal and state legislative and regulatory developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal Medicare program that would affect Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance;  

3) Market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare Supplement insurance;  

4) Interest rate changes that affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield;

5) General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities that we own, or that may impair issuers ability to pay interest due us on those securities;  

6) Changes in pricing competition;  

7) Litigation results;  

8) Levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from our assumptions;  

9) Our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;
